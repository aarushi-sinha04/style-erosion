Authorship verification achieves >90% accuracy on single-domain benchmarks but fails catastrophically (50-54%) when applied to out-of-domain texts. We present the first comprehensive cross-domain analysis, testing models on fanfiction, blogs, emails, and reviews. We show that Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) cause negative transfer when domains are fundamentally dissimilar (A-distance > 1.5). We propose a multi-expert ensemble achieving 72.4% cross-domain accuracy and demonstrate vulnerability to AI-generated attacks (60% success rate, BERTScore > 0.85). Our work establishes benchmarks for cross-domain adversarial authorship verification.
