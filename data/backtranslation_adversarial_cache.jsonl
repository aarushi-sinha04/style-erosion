{"anchor": "Introduction <nl>The transformation from the original labour party to the New Labour party is a significant period in British political history. It was the introduction of a new ideology with similar social democratic values as the past but with the advantage of taking account the changes in the modern era; economically and socially etc. The following essay will focus mainly on the transformation since the 1990s with some reference to the past Labour party that originated before the 1990s. Also, the essay will specifically look at the domestic policies rather than foreign policies. The impact made can be split into focusing on the three main sectors; Health, education and Law &amp; Order. The essay will be discussing whether there has been a major shift in parties or whether it is the same but just holds a new name. Further analysing the positive and negative outcome of this development. Taking into consideration whether there will be a return of new labour. <nl><nl>What is the \u2018Old\u2019 Labour party? <nl>The beginning of the Labour party was in the 1900s (Reid, 1995). The main principle being the \u2018Labour party\u2019 was to take care of the industrial workers during the Queen Victoria Era.. They wanted to protect the rights of the working class who were thought to have different rights in comparison to those in higher classes and simply treated unfairly. The first Labour government wasn't formed till 1924 when prime minister Ramsey McDonald was in power. In the beginning, the Labour party started with only a few members. As a new party forming it was difficult to make decisions on whether the public should publicly make a stand on certain decisions. One of these was to make the \u2018people\u2019 only the centre of attention. Hence introducing \"reforms to improve working conditions and working-class living standards\" (Vickers, 2004).The support towards the \u2018people\u2019 influenced the votes. One of the influences of the ideology behind the Labour party is Socialist thinking. For instance, in the past, the Labour party used socialist theory to influence the formations of foreign policy (Vickers, 2004). This socialist or social-democratic way of thinking encouraged the Labour party to promote, the values of common ownership and equal opportunity. <nl> <nl>Labour is the second most popular party in the United Kingdom right after the Conservative party (The right-wing of the British political spectrum). Even in the 20th century, the Labour parties\u2019 values are still influenced by this socialist thinking. Most of the support and popularity the party gains is because, of its anti-capitalist position. Most new members of the Labour party in 2015 were seen as \"left behind\" by society because their view did not agree with those on the right of the political spectrum and have been deceived those on the left who feel \u2018left behind\u2019 and have been deceived by the developments of globalization which has caused social inequality (Whiteley et al., 2018). <nl>Currently, in 2019 Britain is under the conservatives \u2013 the right of the political spectrum. With <nl>the general elections scheduled to take place in December 2019, Labour is striving to get the nation on its side. Jeremy Corbyn; Leader of the Labour party and the rest of his party clearly states their vision. Within every policy set, the vision embedded is \" for the many, not the few\"(Labour party, 2019). This shows how the party is still upholding the original values it first held in the 19th century by promoting the values of equality rather than focusing on one group. <nl><nl>What is the \u2018New\u2019 Labour party? <nl>New Labour was introduced as the face of the 'new' Labour party introduced by then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. After 18 years of Britain being under the power of the conservatives, the nation finally saw the Labour party return (O'Broin, 1997). Tony Blair of Scottish origin became prime minister on the 2nd of May in 1997 after John Major had resigned. The party introduced the ideology of \"New Labour\" which focused on bringing a new approach to modernise the economy by finding a middle ground between traditional socialism and the free market economy. This is also known as the \u2018third way\u2019. Moving it from the left of the political scale to the centre. <nl>The \"Labour Party Manifesto\" of 1997 said that New Labour rejected the old approaches of \"the old left and those of the Conservative Right\" (Labour-party.org.uk, 1997). It looked for a new way that would appeal to everyone rather than just one perspective. The parties manifesto promised constitutional change and looked at improving services important to the public like the NHS service and finding new ways to help troubled students mainly in deprived areas. This quickly increased Blairs' popularity amongst not only the sick but those in education too. Also, Blair was able to heavily adjust the Policies revolving the law to keep the nation safe therefore he was supported by the general public. <nl>However, his popularity did not last long. Even though Blair attempted to change the face of Labour in a positive way some of his reforms came across as quite radical. For instance, in 1998 university students were asked to pay for tuition fees. Most Students to this day only remember him as the prime minister who re-introduced tuition fees. Other controversial issues just like this pressurised Blair into resigning as prime minister on the 27th of June in 2007 (Blair, 2007). <nl>The New Labour period carried on until 2010 with the aid of prime minister Gordon Brown but after 2010 prime minister David Cameron was appointed and Britain returned to the power of the conservatives (Heffernan, 2011).<nl> <nl>What are the similarities? <nl>New Labour in some perspectives can be seen as \"Continuous with \u2018Old\u2019\" (Allender, 2001). Even though the party has reintroduced itself as a new ideology it still promotes the same values as \u2018old' Labour but instead, it has adapted to the modern world. The outcomes that the Labour party wants to achieve are still similar but the processes have changed. For example, instead of simply giving people what they want, they encouraged people to improve themselves and to find work. <nl>New Labour still concentrates on \"fairness and social justice\" (Temple, 2000).The Labour party was built originally on the idea that everyone deserves the same opportunities. Therefore, Blair was able to introduce a minimum wage in 1998(O'Hara, 2018). This way no one is paid incorrectly and instead, the pay was in alliance with the cost of living in the society, However, some may argue not everyone is treated equally because the pay depends on the individuals' age. Each age group has a different set of minimum wages. So instead it has caused further inequalities. <nl>According to an article written by the guardian, these pledges New Labour was making were what \"Labour had been making for decades and had failed in the past to keep\" (The Guardian, 2005). Therefore, supporters of New Labour could argue that in fact, it was just a party that was taking care of 'Old' Labours' reputation. They were not able to fulfil the promises made to the nation in the past. So New Labour was responsible for damage control and making sure that the Labour name was not tarnished. <nl>Unfortunately for many, one of the sad similarities is that both parties still brought Labour down. Through their time in parliament, they did not fully satisfy the nation. Before New Labour came into power, Britain thought they had hope in this new party since the previous Labour government had left them feeling \"betrayed\" (BBC News, 2010). Even though this huge support brought a rise in New Labour they suffered a fall too when there were economic crises such as the \"credit crunch\" and increases in \"income tax\". <nl><nl>What are the differences? <nl>The main difference that is widely focused on is the \"\u2018modernisation\u2019 element\" which it had done to \"catch up with the times\". (Allender, 2001).This is important for a political party that wants to gain support from the nation. This does not only apply for the elder generations but also for the youth who are seeing the changes to the nation. Therefore, they would be more inclined to vote for a party that looks at the modern aspects rather than the old. <nl>When Labour was not doing as good in terms of gaining interest, a decision was made to start changing and abandoning the traditional aim of only supporting the working class. So, there was a shift from being at the left of the political meter to the centre(Allender, 2001). New Labour no longer wanted to focus on just the working class thus widening its support group. <nl>Different periods meant different types of thinking had to be introduced. This explains why after the second world war \"Keynesian\" ethics were correct to use or after Thatcher left power it was time to adapt to neoliberal ideologies (Allender, 2001). Blair decided to amend clause IV which meant it disassociated Labour from socialist thinking. It did this by starting to reduce \"trade union power and influence within the Labour movement\" (Robinson, n.d.). Thus, focusing more on the consumers rather than producers. <nl>\"Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" (O'Hara, 2018).Thus clearly showed Blair had much stronger attitudes to law and order. Traditional Labour looked at economical or sociological factors to determine the \"cause of the crime\" yet Blair refused to completely do this (New Statesman, 2015) .Blair was able to spend more money on policing, making the public aware to be cautious and prevent them from committing crimes. This way New Labour was able to make a significant impact on the level of crime committed resulting in a safer environment for everyone. <nl>Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).The \"coalition\u2019s 'social justice' strategy\" was considered to help those who were disadvantaged because of their environment and upbringing. New Labour wanted to make sure that those who were in the lower or middle classes still could be as successful as those in the higher class. <nl><nl>What were the positive outcomes of New Labour? <nl>Blair made more investments other than only in the law and order sector. For instance in the education sector. Spending more money on children and the younger generation meant it would help them stay focused and not on the streets. Influencing them to do positive things that could shape their future but also one of the future societies they would later form. New Labour's \"number one priority\" was education as promised in the parties\u2019 manifesto of 1997 (Heath et al., 2013). <nl>This was later proved when achievements were made. Their investing and prioritisation achieved results such as only \"one in twelve\" secondary schools were below the basic minimum standard. This was a big development in comparison to nearly half of all schools below standard in 1997 when New Labour acknowledged the area of needed development. <nl>Funding in the health department was also increased. An article writing about that period claims There was a \" huge injection of money\" into the NHS (The Guardian, 2007). This was a change because past tory governments did not spend that much. This meant there would be in decrease like waiting times at the A&amp;E but also better facilities to access. This brought the social group of those who were sick or disabled to create stronger support for the New Labour parties' reforms. <nl>Businesses and those interested in the market system were fond of New Labours' new policies revolving the market. New Labour had thought of the \"prawn cocktail offensive\" (Giddens, 2010). This was a strategy that influenced the support from those in the finance society. This type of market economics gave consumers much more freedom in making decisions that would impact their businesses in comparison to the previous government. Due to the fact, these groups were now given shared responsibility, they felt more a part of the nation rather than before where decisions were being made without their input. <nl><nl>What were the negative outcomes of the New Labour Party? <nl>Some argued that New Labour was just \" Thatcherism continued\" (Dorling, 2010). Critique Danny Dorling argued that New Labour did not achieve anything. Instead, Blair followed the same steps as Thatcher and this resulted in the income equalities to further rise instead of creating a difference that Blair had promised. The build-up to New Labour allowing more of the NHS to become private or the introduction to university tuition fees meant a result of wealth inequality. Again, only those with money in their pockets were given more opportunities and better services. <nl>Those who look at it from a 'Relational' perspective could argue that the nation was \"encouraged... to be \u2018consumers\u2019 of services rather than participants\" (IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research), 2016). This means there is a possibility more public services were reformed into becoming privatized. Those\u2019 participants\u2019 who are not fortunate enough wouldn't be able to be consumers. Supporters of \u2018old' Labour were not pleased by this \"privatization by stealth\" (Vidler and Clarke, 2005). Due to the fact it just carried on creating inequalities. <nl>State welfare was not a reform everyone was pleased with. In an article analysing \"social democratic values\" (Shaw, 2003).Writer Eric Shaw discusses the idea of \"poverty traps\". Are people benefiting from the state welfare if the amount of money given is provisional and only certain groups in society are benefiting from this? An article discussing poverty within the Labour party believes New Labour seems to be instead of using poverty traps as a means to \" justify its welfare reforms\" (Stepney, Lynch and Jordan, 1999). It holds its traditional value by allowing wealth to be distributed equally. However, it withholds the nation's full support by making the rich believe they are making the poor wealthier which makes them believe it is unfair. <nl>Some could argue that New Labour spent way too much money. New Labour made many promises in its manifestos to the nation so it had to try and achieve them. Their journey to handling \" social exclusion\" meant \"heavy. Investments (such as) \u00a31.7 billion (was) spent on the New Deal for Communities\" Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).However, even after all this money, there was always more problems following the ones that were solved. For instance, the recovering support needed afterward for those who had a problem with drugs was not given. Therefore, not every single social group was fully satisfied. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>Unfortunately for some the New Labour party saw a rise and then a fall. Britain has not seen the Labour party return back to power since 2010. Instead, the conservatives have managed to win the elections and gain the interests of the public. In the upcoming 2019 December general elections Labour has been greatly promoted but as just as the \u2018Labour Party\u2019. Since 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was appointed as Labour party leader he shifted Labour on the political scale back to the left from the centre (Bowie,2018). Due to the fact New Labour promoted its modernised values, there\u2019s a possibility in the future Blairs Labour could be developed and improved to meet the needs of those who disapproved of the shift to the centre. However, New Labours' dramatic fall in history and negatives outcomes could discourage the public trust in such a party. Throughout this exploration of the transformation from 'Old' Labour to New Labour, you can see clearly that there are more differences than similarities. Blair tried to change the face of Labour huge but failed to make it work. This can be shown through how the negative outcome heavily outweighs the positives.

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. <nl>Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. <nl>Evaluation of market segment<nl>With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this \u2018Under 22\u2019 bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 \u2013 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher\u2019s fairs should focus on the \u2018Under 22\u2019 package as this is most relevant to first year students.<nl><nl><nl>Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city.<nl>This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success.<nl>Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel.<nl><nl>Positioning<nl>As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost.<nl>To identify Car Club\u2019s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. <nl>Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers\u2019 initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people.<nl><figure><nl>If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of \u00a33.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around \u00a32.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It\u2019s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. <nl>Sixt and Avis start at \u00a351 (Sixt 2020) and \u00a360 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of \u00a336day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs.<nl>The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club\u2019s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility.<nl>In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success.<nl><figure><nl>Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team!<nl>The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club\u2019s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category.<nl><nl>Car Club\u2019s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so.<nl>From Car Club\u2019s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham.<nl><figure><nl>Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives.<nl><nl>Campaign Objectives<nl>1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population)<nl>As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham\u2019s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher\u2019s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club\u2019s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention.<nl><nl>2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher\u2019s fairs within the city<nl>Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users\u2019 involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. <nl><nl>Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools<nl>The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming.<nl>Push strategy \u2013 Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student\u2019s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise\u2019s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors.<nl><nl>Pull strategy \u2013 This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers\u2019 minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness.<nl>As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers\u2019 positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion.<nl><nl>Marketing tools plan<nl>Personal selling<nl>Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication \u2026 in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy \u2026 a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers\u2019 presence on campus at  fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club\u2019s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. <nl><nl>Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use.<nl>Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise\u2019s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. <nl>Testing<nl>Personal sellers\u2019 ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher\u2019s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the  venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data.<nl>Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments.<nl><nl>Advertising<nl>Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication \u2026 designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS\u2019 lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that  \"77%\u00a0of students are using Instagram, and\u00a075%\u00a0are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club\u2019s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students\u2019 social-media usage whilst remaining affordable.<nl>Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness.<nl><nl>Integration of marketing communications <nl>Enterprise\u2019s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 as they are socially active \u2018communaholics\u2019, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide.<nl>Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company\u2019s market position and standing by Enterprise\u2019s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service.<nl>The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online.<nl><nl>Implementation plan<nl>Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April \u2013 Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops.<nl>Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn\u2019t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "positive": "r <addr4_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I am on my placement year of <course><nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr4_FN>,<nl><nl>Can you please remove me from this mailing list, I do not study <course><new>Good Afternoon,<nl><nl>I saw today that final year modules have become available for selection and I am considering taking intermediate <language>.

Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992).<nl>Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so.<nl>John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017).<nl>As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008),  who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008).<nl><nl>John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently.\u2028<nl>John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood.<nl><nl>Coping:<nl>John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not  actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit  university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance.<nl>In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). <nl><nl>Interventions:<nl>The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and  has  little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007).<nl>Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation <nl>The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": "as going to hold them for half a year but like i said if they spike quickly to like 45 bb and 50+ pltr i might sell<new>Even 40 bb<new>Depends how nice pl looks<new>Oke<new>Would be \u00a31000 profit altogether<new>About 950<new>Id probably sell before them tbh<new>That would double my portfolio lol<new>Id be at like 1.6k<new>Hopefully it even reaches 40<new>And pltr highest was 42 so 50 is manageable<new>So damm illegal<new>On bb theyve legit reversed price back to 2 days ago<new>Holy cow 143<new>\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<new>Lmfao the worlds markets are broken this week<new>Th head honcho gme man", "attacked": "as I said, if they peak fast like 45 bb and 50+ pltr I could sell <new>Already 40 bb <new>Depends how nice pl looks <new>Oke <new>Would 1000 pounds of gain be total <new>about 950 <new>Id probably sell before them tbh <new>That would double my portfolio lol <new>Id be like 1.6 k <new>Hopefully it reaches even 40 <new>And pltr was highest 42 so 50 is manageable <new>So damn illegal <new>On bb theyve legit reverse price back to 2 days before <new>Holy cow 143 <new> <new> <new> <new>Lmfao the world markets are broken this week <new>Th head honcho gme man gme back to 2 days ago <new>Holy cow 143 <new> <new> <new>", "attack_type": "back_translation"}

The BBC writes of an example of a 15hour flight with 350 passengers, two of which tested positive for Covid-19, after the lengthy flight none of the other passengers had contracted the virus. (Article) The article goes on to explain how the air in a plane is completely renewed every two to three minutes, making for a relatively safe environment.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Obviously there will always be exceptions to this and there will never be a journey that is completely safe, but with body temperature scanning at airports and compulsory mask wearing, the industry is taking far more precautions than areas which I am exposed to on a regular basis such as shops and supermarkets. If this still isn\u2019t satisfactory, I would be more than prepared to consider other travel options such as driving or taking a train to further negate the risk. However, I am confident the airline industry is taking the necessary precautions. In addition, I am more than happy to sign any waivers or disclaimers regarding insurance, which I will arrange myself. <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I will be able to self-isolate prior to travelling and will take private transfers at either end of the flight. This minimises the risk to just a single journey that would then facilitate my working in <country> for an entire year, providing me with invaluable work experience. Once in <country>, it is compulsory for me to register with the <organisation> for my health insurance. After which I will have access to one of the best healthcare systems in <continent>. With this to rely on alongside <country>'s impressive track-record of controlling the virus, I would be in very safe hands. Statistically, I am more likely to catch the virus in the UK!

{"anchor": "The topic of research investigated was Perception of Beauty, this topic was chosen as a result of its major current infleunce within today\u2019s society from influencing an individual\u2019s perception of beauty about themselves and beauty as a social construct. Furthermore, the perception surrounding beauty has not just been relevant to within today\u2019s society it also has had major influences throughout history in terms of the ideal body image evidently seen with icons such as Marilyn Monroe and desired hairstyles amongst culture throughout history. A Discourse Analysis inspired by Willig (2001) take on discourse, was used as it allowed for in depth understanding of themes and constructs which arose from the broad topic of beauty. Followed by the practices of these constructs whilst also adopting a subjective approach based on the interviewees experience. <nl>In addition, using a semi-structured interview was useful for this topic of research as it allowed for both freedom and interpretation of beauty whilst maintaining focus on the interviewees\u2019 perception of beauty.  To ensure confidentiality the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Susan. <nl>Discourse 1- \u2018Beauty is beyond skin deep\u2019 <nl>When asked to define beauty Susan\u2019s demonstrates immediately categorises beauty into two categories \u2018superficial\u2019 and \u2018deeper beauty\u2019. Susan\u2019s attitude towards the discourse of superficial beauty has already been perceived as negative, this is evident through the depth of explanation in which both types of beauty are described. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan\u2019s shallow explanation of the discourse of superficial beauty positions herself throughout interview as having a negative view of beauty being based on the outward appearance. This again is reiterated through her humour on the discourse, as she states \u2018it\u2019s like your outward beauty can get you so far coz you know when you grow old\u2026 You get a litt\u2019l crusty\u2019. The choice of the word \u2018crusty\u2019, suggests that one\u2019s perception of beauty only being based on outward appearance is futile, as it essentially it will no longer be the determining factor of beauty.<nl>Contrastingly, Susan\u2019s\u2019 in-depth explanation on the discourse of inward beauty suggests the value in which she holds inward beauty as better a perception of beauty to have. The discursive list such as \u2018character\u2019, \u2018personality\u2019 and behaviour demonstrate the longevity of that aspect of beauty and its hierarchy which constructs Susan\u2019s perception of beauty as it surpasses artificial beauty. <nl>Despite Susan positioning of inward beauty, it can be argued that the opposition of both discursive catergories highlights a sense of wanting inclusivity and identity in the way in which beauty is perceived. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan\u2019s avoidance of wanting to admit that superficial is more prominent than inner beauty, constructs the feeling of otherness surrounding outward appearance as it connotes a sense of isolation and division from what she desires to be beautiful versus society\u2019s ideals of beauty. The themes which arise from the conflict of these discourses run throughout the interview. As Susan repeatedly positions herself against societies ideals of beauty and her own, this is evident through the consistent use of discursive pronouns \u2018I feel likeI think\u2019 and her separation from society as she states, \u2018but in nowadays\u2019 (lines 39 and 52).<nl>Furthermore, Susan further demonstrates the discourse of inclusivity through the specific type of social influencers she uses in response to the question asked in line 73.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>The examples used by Susan reaffirms this discourse, as the role models appear to display characteristics of the average human such as \u2018embracing her tummy\u2019. This non-superficial beauty demonstrated by the role models brings forth implications that Susan\u2019s perception of beauty can also be accepted despite society\u2019s perception of beauty. Furthermore, the discursive object of authenticity, can also be drawn from the examples used in regard to have a perception of beauty that everyone can obtain, this is further seen Susan refers to both sexes. <nl>Discourse 2- Outward beauty is not always negative<nl>Despite Susan presenting the negative aspects of outward beauty it can be argued whether outward beauty is completely negative.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>The discourse of style from outward beauty illustrates that outward beauty is not entirely negative as it can also be used as a guide to find one\u2019s own beauty through style, as Susan admits that she was \u2018terrible at dressing\u2019. This also exemplifies how outward appearance constructs identity as similarly seen with Susan\u2019s\u2019 previous reference to Ashley Graham and Nella Rose as \u2018good influences.\u2019<nl>Moreover, within the discourse of style it can also be argued that not all aspects associated with outward beauty is superficial and negative. This is evident with the use of accessorises and \u2018activities such as shaving or ear piercing\u2019 (Sinkman, 2013), used to enhance beauty but is not deemed as a damaging percpetion of beauty concerning outward beauty, as it appears to be a construct accepted in society and to majority of individuals\u2019. <nl>By the same token, from a business perspective it can be argued that the discourse of outward beauty is not entirely negative, regarding the profit made by brands such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Mac and Huda Beauty Cosmetics, as the Business Insider reported that the beauty industry is \u2018estimated worth $532 billion\u2019. <nl>From both examples used above opposes, Susan\u2019s initial perception surrounding the discourse of the outward appearance concerning beauty; this demonstrates the complexity surrounding the discourse of perceptions of beauty as it does not appear clear and cut.<nl>Discourse 3- The Medias\u2019 perception of beauty is damaging<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan\u2019s\u2019 tempered response to the question asked in line 54 presents the discourse of media being the main reason behind the damaging perception of beauty in particular social media. Social media apps such as Instagram appear to be dominant discursive objects, which influence perceptions of beauty as themes such as self-gratification and acceptance. This is apparent within the example used by Susan as she illustrates a mother\u2019s perception of beauty towards their child in comparison to Instagram\u2019s perception of their beauty. Despite a mother voice having a significance of a child\u2019s perception of themselves, it appears that social media drowns this voice as they quickly conclude that \u2018I am not\u2019 beautiful. This abrupt conclusion suggests that social media holds a lot weight regards to perceptions of beauty. <nl>Additionally, the repeated discourse of superficial beauty arose again in relation to the discursive object of social media, the conjunction of both discourses reaffirmed Susan negative attitude towards the discourse\u2019s influence on beauty. This is explicitly seen with her paralinguistic such as the sucking of her teeth and laugh in line 64-65 associated with the discourses, as she refers to it as \u2018fake\u2019. Susan\u2019s\u2019 attitude towards the medias false perception of beauty aligns with Sinkman (2013) statement that \u2018society is becoming increasingly concerned with mechanisms to obtain or improve beauty, such as beauty enhancements, body modi\ufb01cation.\u2019 This is apparent within todays current concerns concerning surgeries such as Brazilian Butt Lifts to achieve the \u2018ideal body type\u2019, as statistics show that it is deadliest type of plastic surgery with 3000 cases of death. Through this statistic it reveals the social pressure as a discursive object to achieve the ideal perception of beauty.<nl>Moreover, it can also be discussed that social media such as Instagram is not the only outlet of media that produces pressure as a discursive object. Media outlets such as magazines can also present a discourse of pressure and damage about perception of beauty, this is explicit within criticism surrounds fashion magazines such as Vogue; as they were criticised for photoshopping their \u2018cover to make plus-sized model look thinner\u2019.<nl>Therefore, it can be concluded that Susan\u2019s attitude towards these discourses holds a certain credibility about the rising concerns of beauty standards within today\u2019s society.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan recognises that the perception of beauty discussed for majority of the interview was Westernised perceptions of beauty and recognises the other cultural perceptions of beauty. <nl>This demonstrates beauty as an ethnocentric discursive object as within every culture what is perceived as beautiful to one may be perceived undesirable to another, in addition it also shows the equal weighing of environment playing an equal factor in perceptions of beauty in correspondence to media which is normally the first considered influenced on beauty.  <nl><nl>Discourse 5- Perceptions of beauty is never fixed <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan shows that the discourse of beauty is temporal, as throughout history what was concerned as beautiful changed this is apparent through eras in history such as Egyptian Beauty and Victorian Beauty. As Egyptian beauty included both male and females going to great lengths regarding appearance, consisting of dramatic dark eye makeup and wigs in contrast to the Victorian Era which involved a pale face and rosy cheeks. The vast difference in beauty amongst these two eras demonstrates the discourse of beauty being temporal.<nl>Susan appears to present that the discourse of beauty is not completely objective or subjective but in fact there is middle ground as the discursive objects such as culture, genre, era play a role in the objective aspect of standards of beauty. Alongside with the subjective aspect in relation to having a choice in what type of beauty an individual wants to adopt. <nl>Discussion<nl>Throughout the interview the discourses presented demonstrate the complexity of perceptions of beauty. This can be seen with the two opposing aspects concerning the discourse of outward appearance, as on one spectrum it is perceived as futile as it conveys an unrealistic beauty standard to obtain. whilst on the other spectrum outward beauty in relation to style is not frowned upon as it is perceived as beauty to aspire to, in relation to providing a guide on fashion. Furthermore, this interview also demonstrated the various influences on both an individual\u2019s perception of beauty and societal construct concerning beauty which is contingent on music genre, history era and culture. Therefore, showing a grey area in having a perception of beauty as a ones percpetion of beauty cannot be completely right or wrong.<nl><nl>", "positive": "d Morning <addr2_NN>, Hope you are well. <nl>I need some advice on what to do, if I remember correctly I don't think my DBS fully processed because the <organisation> office required to have a current bank statement bank letter which never able to get for some reason because it always got sent to my house in <city>.

{"anchor": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that captures the obligation of a business to the environment, its stakeholders and the broader society (Blowfield, 2005). Over the years, the concept has evolved from corporate philanthropy (Bowen, 1953) to incorporate broader concerns such as environment and human rights, driven by social rights and legislative change (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). In recent years, CSR has been viewed as a link between business strategy and sustainable development, causing companies to utilise industry standards such as the United Nations Development Goals and Global Compact. This pressure from stakeholders to go beyond the minimal requirements allows companies to address broader goals and objectives, and by doing so, a positive brand image is created (Carroll, 2016).<nl>Political influence can be defined as a \"social influence process in which behaviour is strategically designed to maximise short-term or long-term self-interest, which is either consistent with, or at the expense of other\u2019s interests\" (Ferris, Russ and Fandt, 1989). Political CSR is described as activities where \"CSR has an intended or unintended political impact, or where intended or unintended political impacts on CSR exist\". Therefore, political CSR can be used in three ways, which will be analysed further; these include being used as a substitute for non-conventional forms of political activity or directly supporting conventional political activities such as lobbying and constituency building. Additionally, CSR can be used in a novel or innovative way which does not directly correspond to political activity (Frynas and Stephens, 2014). This assignment will evaluate research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political activity, analysing the three ways CSR has been utilised to advance corporations political standing concerning real-life cases.<nl>The reasons in which CSR can be strategically used generally concerns initiatives to build corporate brand image or reputation, constituency building, building relationships and even agenda setting whereby donations can reinforce key industry messages to shift perceptions (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). In order to analyse the relationship between CSR and political influence, this report will be focusing heavily on the research surrounding Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and oil and gas companies. However, it must be noted that there is a limitation of the research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political influence, as it primarily focuses on these industries.<nl>Industries surrounding public health and the environment has been seen to invest heavily in CSR operations to \"offset\" their negative brand image and gain political support due to operations that are seen as working directly against society\u2019s benefit (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). For-profit corporations have been increasingly promoting that they act as partners with government and communities to address social problems. These partnerships are what Coca-Cola\u2019s former CEO refers to as \"connected capitalism\", in which collaborations help maximise shareholder value (Foster, 2014). In turn, by utilising constituency building, corporations can facilitate access to policy elites and build relationships with them. This relates to a global triangle, an approach to sustainability in which business, government, and civil society join. Coca-Cola\u2019s CEO claims the partnership system Coca-Cola has developed is \"the most beautiful example\" of the golden triangle where each party can come together and make a difference to big societal problems (Radtke, 2013).  Although CSR sees an increasingly political role for business firms, corporations are analysed to \"step in\" using \"a global triangle\" to fill governance gaps which they present as governments failing to do so alone. This positioning to take on political responsibilities is seen as a way to present themselves as pursuing public interests whilst pursuing their own political interests whilst building relationships (Eberlein, 2019).<nl>CSR as a means of Constituency Building and Facilitating Access to Policy Elites<nl>Ha and Hoang (2020) discovered a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and political risk, suggesting that firms are more likely to invest in CSR as an \"insurance mechanism\" against adverse political events. Corporations can utilise CSR to support conventional political activities through constituency-building strategies to establish relationships with key opinion leaders, policymakers, media, and community involvement. In turn, this attempts to influence public policy by gaining the support of voters and citizens, who in turn express their preferences to political decision-makers (Mialon et al., 2016) (Hillman and Hitt, 1999). Although constituency building is a relatively robust strategy, Rehbein and Schuler (2013) argue that it is hard for companies to implement effectively. This is due to the difficulties convincing societal groups to politically participate, showing the support of a corporation. Even if stakeholders were to participate, it is hard to guarantee their effectiveness (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>Neu et al. (1998) discussed that firms expanding their efforts to manage their legitimacy forestalls regulatory activities by the state that might occur without these efforts. Therefore, utilising CSR as a method of constituency building can minimise the political, legislative changes that can broadly impact businesses due to the legitimisation effect. For example, Mialon et al. discovered that Coca-Cola in Australia heavily used constituency building strategies by using CSR to have relationships with health organisations, community groups and policymakers. More specifically, Coca-Cola developed an initiative to encourage physical activity for kids called \"The Happiness Cycle\", partnering with an Australian charity. This was also interpreted as an agenda-settingframing activity as the company promoted the initiative to \"curb obesity\" and emphasised that they wished to be \"part of the solution\" (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>By using their reputation and influence in a region gained by their CSR initiatives, companies such as Coca-Cola can wield power in governmental organisations. This was present in India, where two members of FSSAI (Food Safety Standards Authority India) are affiliated with an organisation funded by Coca-Cola. This organisation has undermined public health policies by networking with nutrition sciences to nudge \"government policy into alignment with the company\u2019s corporate interests\" (Greenhalgh, 2019). By employing CSR through community campaigns, corporations can gain a sense of \"legitimacy\" that forms a sense of trust, increasing the likelihood that constituency building will be effective and increase their political influence. Furthermore, enhancing legitimacy enables corporations to conduct business activities more effectively than firms that do not engage in community CSR activities and may help minimise risks such as shareholder activism, boycotts of products and negative media coverage (Mirvis, Googins and Rochlin, 2007).<nl>However, Mialon et al.\u2019s research surrounding the food industry's corporate political activity can be criticised because it could only incorporate publicly available information. This means that the research is unlikely to give a complete picture of the practices adopted by the food industry, as there is a lack of public documentation surrounding political activity, such as lobbying policymakers and private interactions. Therefore, this questions the validity of their findings, and the specific details of how CSR industry practices influence political activity needs to have further investigation.<nl>Exploiting CSR politically to work with other influential groups creates the perception that the message a corporation wishes to convey is balanced and credible, adding to the benefits of using CSR as a means of constituency building (Friedman et al., 1994). Using statistical analysis, Navarro (1998) concluded that although a company\u2019s philanthropic activities can enhance brand image, increasing the effectiveness of lobbying activities, there was no direct relationship found between CSR activities and policy outcomes. As suggested previously, only firms working against public welfare will be using CSR to gain political influence, such as those within public health and energy industries. Therefore, as Navarro\u2019s study incorporated a range of firms from different industries, it was unlikely to find a correlation between CSR and political outcomes. <nl>CSR can be strategically utilised to meet stakeholder needs and improve a company\u2019s competitiveness and profitability (Porter and Kramer, 2006). CSR can be used to gain a positive brand image to attract more customers with the increasing demand from stakeholders for companies to adopt socially responsible practices to create a more sustainable and equitable world. Not all CSR initiatives are used to gain political influence, but the benefits of a positive brand image indirectly can help firms gain political power through Constituency and Relationship Building.<nl>CSR as a means of Agenda Setting<nl>As mentioned previously, CSR is also used as an Agenda Setting method to produce political effects. Fooks discovered a close connection between agenda-setting and constituency building where donations were allocated by BAT to groups \"based on their potential to shape policy agenda through their influence on government thinking and news reporting\" (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of death, illness and impoverishment, killing more than 8 million people each year (WHO, 2020). However, despite this significant public health crisis, tobacco companies and other unhealthy commodities utilise CSR as a PR initiative to create the illusion that they are a \"changed\" company and operate with health interests (WHO, 2009). Research by Fooks et al. analyses that Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco (BAT) engages in CSR primarily due to the potential to promote policy outcomes that work against public welfare. Specifically to prevent the introduction of effective government regulation, which has a record of effectiveness in reducing tobacco consumption (Fooks et al., 2012). Utilising CSR as an Agenda Setting method has allowed BAT to make donations towards reinforcing industry messages designed to alter the discussion of tobacco control away from public health and more towards the economic impacts and employment opportunities the industry gives.<nl>Agenda setting aims to manipulate public awareness surrounding issues prevalent in an industry that directly correlates to Coca-Cola. Hamilton (2015) discovered that Coca-Cola\u2019s press releases surrounding CSR have a language that exhibits a paternalistic mentality with words like \"serve,\" \"help,\" and \"provide\". This paternalistic activism contends that outsiders are not best equipped to solve social and environmental issues, therefore boosting the image of their importance. The corporation exhibits a \"power-over\" approach that analysed as robbing communities of the \"decision-making process that affect their lives\" (Ledwith and Springett, 2010). It is hard for the general population to gain back their political influence from corporations acting in a CSR positive way when considering the substantial disparity between communities and Coca-Cola\u2019s access to resources, political decision-makers, and media outlets (Hamilton, 2015). <nl>Additionally, in Georgia, USA, the Coca-Cola foundation pledged $3.8m to tackle obesity with the public health agency, the CDC (Radtke, 2013). The Times reported that the money given to the CDC contributed towards a strategy of funding scientists \"who encouraged the public to focus on exercise and worry less about how calories contribute to obesity\" (Kaplan, 2017). Utilising this charitable CSR initiative can take the narrative away from their unhealthy sugar-filled drinks contributing to obesity. By presenting themselves alongside their CSR projects using paternalistic vocabulary to the media, Coca Cola can shape the public agenda and shift perceptions of the underlying adverse effects of their operations and impact on public health. <nl>G\u00f3mez (2019) found that three primary factors can limit Coca-Cola\u2019s agenda-setting influence, which is likely to impact other corporations. First, the ability of industry lobbyists to meet with legislative members; second, the pre-existing ties a government has with a corporation and the interests they have in benefiting from the companies\u2019 operations and finally; the corporation supported researchers and activist\u2019s vs the public health advocates, which are divided on opinions. All three of these limiting factors can have risk reduced by CSR initiatives surrounding constituency building, building relationships, agenda-setting and improving brand image.<nl>CSR as a means to support lobbying activities<nl>Regarding lobbying to change the narrative, it is a practice whereby a company or organisation aims to influence government leaders to create legislation that will benefit their industry somehow. The oil and gas industry has been reported as the 6th highest lobbying spender in the United States in 2020 (Duffin, 2021). It is common practice for oil and gas companies to engage in \"greenwashing\" to appear more environmentally responsible (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). Nasiritousi (2017) wrote about oil and gas companies and how their input and attendance at climate change conventions is controversial as one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. However, they portray themselves as lobbyists against climate change and fund organisations which discredit climate science. These corporations spend countless amounts of money to change the narrative, such as campaigns that convince consumers that their lifestyles must change, as also seen with Coca Cola previously. Campaigns promote that humans are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases- prevaricating the possibility that they are the largest polluters. Showing that they are \"reactive\" to these issues and rebranding themselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis helps to minimise the chances of a significant policy change being implemented that will further impact their business (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011).<nl>The oil and gas industry can be analysed using Goffman\u2019s (1959) self-presentation theory whereby activities are analysed by a \"front-stage\" of how companies present themselves sustainably and the \"back-stage\" which relates to their corporate political activities. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) bill has been a considerable controversy for the oil industry. It was designed to allow oil investigations to occur in sensitive environmental areas (Cho et al., 2016). Environmentalists and Indigenous communities disputed the ANWR bill due to the irreparable impact oil companies would have on their land. Cho et al. (2016) analysed how oil firms sustainability and CSR practices pressed on the importance of environmental care, ensuring that their CSR practices were visible. However, they kept their proactive political actions targeted towards their interests of passing the bill \"back-stage\". This is a form of impression management whereby firms push CSR practices to an audience to be perceived favourably, and these elements are what the firms are getting more attention for. This method of emphasising positives and underplaying the negatives of their intentions is a common component of sustainability reports whereby corporations will seek to demonstrate how their activities are aligned with social expectations (Goffman 1959; Collinson 1999; Cho et al., 2016).<nl>Corporate Reputation and Image<nl>In addition, Chen et al. (2007) discuss how US companies with worse product and safety infringements were more likely to give to charity than those with better records. They analyse how CSR can be used as a \"distracting technique\" which is an innovative method of gaining political influence without directly operating politically. Their findings suggest that corporate philanthropy is used more for legitimisation than a measure of CSR performance. Companies can legitimise operations by utilising creative philanthropic activities by rebranding their image to reshape public imagination or ideology (Chen et al., 2007). <nl>For example, trans-national corporations (TNC) are known for exploiting the environment in emerging market economies more commonly than developed economies. This is because TNC\u2019s are likely to utilise the cheap labour and abundance of resources available in emerging market economies and exploit these for profit-maximisation purposes (Khanna, Palepu and Sinha, 2005). In order to minimise political changes such as increased taxes, emission permits and caps on natural resource use, companies can employ CSR initiatives to regions to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure and social programmes, presenting themselves as a positive contributor to the region (Hohnen and Potts, 2007)<nl>In 2000, Coca-Cola established a plant in Kerala, India, where their bottling plant drew around 510,000 litres of water from open wells and boreholes. Non-governmental organisations (NGO\u2019s) discovered that water table levels have decreased from 12m to 35m below the groundwater level. Local women and children had to walk nearly 5km twice a day to fetch water, although it was often unsuitable for drinking and bathing as the water burned their eyes and led to numerous skin conditions (Raj and Shaji, 2017). Additionally, harvest dropped by 40% due to the lack of irrigation, and Coca-Cola allowed toxic wastewater to flow into farmers\u2019 fields near the bottling plants (Foy and Senker, 2012). Coca Cola has been documented to have numerous unethical violations worldwide, such as human rights violations in Columbia and environmental violations in India. <nl>However, The Coca-Cola Foundation has donated over $1 billion in contributions to enhance local communities\u2019 sustainability, focusing on areas such as water conservation and recycling, economic empowerment for women, providing education, youth development, and other community and civic initiatives (Coca-Cola, n.d.). These donations are vital to governments that do not have the financial means to provide these services themselves, therefore relying on TNC\u2019s heavily, which increases the power corporations hold in these regions (Willem te Velde, 2002). By positioning themselves as intensely involved in water conservation and community products, unethical behaviour is more likely to be overlooked, and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So, by engaging in CSR practices, incorporating business initiatives that benefit society, Coca Cola can uphold its positive image as a family-focused brand whilst minimising chances of political penalties on operations.<nl>Although the theory of using CSR as a method of distraction which Chen et al. (2007) discusses, was a strongly developed argument that companies with worse environmental and product safety history were more likely to give to charity than those with better operational history had some limitations to consider. The research focused on the pattern of charitable donations as purely a distraction technique, ignoring the discussion on the other reasons and effects of the patterns of charitable giving such as political CSR. Despite this, the research mentioned above shows a pattern of CSR encouraging bad behaviour to more likely be overlooked and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So even though CSR can be used as a distracting technique per se, the charitable contributions produce a legitimisation effect, which can help with political activities such as lobbying, access to policy elites, and constituency building due to the increased positive brand image.<nl>Final Analysis to Conclude<nl>It is without a doubt that there is a strong relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence from the research provided above. However, as expressed previously, different industries are likely to use political CSR in vastly alternative ways, leading this topic to be challenging to analyse. Most research surrounds public health and environmental corporations that produce negative externalities to society. Therefore, even though the research utilised shows the strengths in the relationship, it cannot be entirely reliable and applied to all industries.<nl>The research provided in this paper suggests that there is a relationship whereby CSR is used as an insurance mechanism against political risks, insinuating that corporations are likely to increase CSR activities when the political environment is uncertain. Without a doubt, industries working against the public\u2019s welfare have benefitted from using CSR as a means to gain political influence, as seen with the oil and gas industries \"greenwashing\" activities, Coca-Cola\u2019s constituency building and BAT\u2019s donations to shape policy agenda. Additionally, improving brand image has been seen to help corporations legitimise operations to shape the views of the public and policy setters by forming a sense of trust.<nl>In order to identify the true relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence, it would be necessary to expand research in a broader range of industries. The available research displays a pattern between increasing CSR practises when operational activities are not in the public interests. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong relationship between CSR and political activities, at least in the industries concerning public health and energy, or involving questionable product safety. If this were applied to industries that do not primarily work against public welfare, there would be a weaker relationship between CSR and political influence.", "positive": "<addr3_FN>,<nl><nl>So sorry about this, I have attached the word version now!

{"anchor": "This essay shall address the question \"What are the core assumptions and key features of the biological and psychoanalytical perspectives in psychology? In what ways are they similar and how do they differ?\". Each approach has their own individual assumptions and features, some of which are strengths and some of which are weaknesses, but each perspective has its place in psychological science as they can both be used in suitable situations, with the Biological approach being a more scientific, research based, utilitarian perspective, and the Psychoanalytical approach being a more theoretical, subjective, purity focused perspective towards psychology (Singh, 1991).<nl>One core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many of our adult behavior and feelings stem from childhood experiences. An example of this is Freud\u2019s theory of the Psychosexual developmental stages, a key feature of the Psychodynamic approach. This theory is characterized by the five stages of childhood development; these are the Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latent, and Genital stages (Brown, 1964). According to Psychodynamic theory, each of these stages must be successfully completed in order for the individual to progress, and failure to complete any particular stage will result in fixation. Fixation refers to the id\u2019s inability to transfer its pleasure-seeking focus from one psychosexual stage to the next. Without this natural progression, fixation will be shown in the behavior and feelings of the individual (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), for example someone with an oral fixation may take up smoking or start biting the nails, as they find pleasure in these oral-related activities. At this point, the Psychodynamic approach delves into the Biological side of psychology in a key feature referred to as \u2018Psychosomatic\u2019 disorders. This is the idea that unconscious psychological factors can produce physical manifestations, often seen as a disease or symptom, and that these disorders can be treated or cured by resolving the internal psychological cause, be it past trauma or a psychosexual fixation (Freud &amp; Riviere, 1961). This core assumption covers the \u2018nurture\u2019 side of the nature nurture debate as fixation tends to be the result of the way the child is raised, however the very presence of the psychosexual stages in everyone relates to the nature side of the debate. <nl>Another core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach is \u2018Psychic determinism\u2019. This is the theory that all behavior is caused by mental processes. This idea of all behavior having a psychological cause is shown in the psychodynamic theory of structure of personality. This structure is made up of three parts, the Id, Ego, and Superego, with the Id being the driving force behind our pleasure seeking behavior, the Superego counteracting the Id with the morality of our desires, and the Ego balancing the two to comply with the rules of society and reality (Freud &amp; Rickman, A General Selection from the Works of Sigmund Freud, 1953). Freud\u2019s theory of personality structure addresses the determinism versus free will dichotomy as, if all behavior is dictated by the interactions between the three structures, then the individual has no freedom in their actions.<nl>One last core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many feelings and behaviors are driven by unconscious forces. This is seen in Freud\u2019s theory of the Unconscious, which is in turn related to the theory of personality structure. The theory of the Unconscious separates the mind into three levels of consciousness; There is the Conscious which is our fully accessible thought, and then there is the Preconscious which can be accessed using psychodynamic techniques and the Unconscious which cannot be accessed, both of which operate in the subconscious level of thought (Freud &amp; Strachey, On Metapsychology: The Theory of Psychoanalysis, 1984). These are further related to the theory of personality structure as the different structures are located in different levels of consciousness. The Id operates solely in the Unconscious mind, the Ego exists mainly in the Conscious mind, and the Superego spans across all three levels of consciousness (Costigan, 1967). This interaction between the levels of consciousness is an example of the Psychodynamic approach\u2019s stance on the Idiographic versus Nomothetic debate, as the unconscious drives that affect behavior are generalized to humanity as a whole rather than individuals being affected by different unconscious forces or having differing levels of consciousness.<nl>A core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is that for psychology to be considered a valid science rather than a pseudoscience, then it must be treated as a science. In order for this to happen the scientific method must be upheld as it would be in any other scientific field of study, including using correct experimental methods such as Laboratory, Field, Natural, and Quasi experiments (Beatty, 2001). These are used to test hypotheses, the data from which is then peer reviewed. This core assumption relies on the Determinism argument rather than free will; For causational relationships between variables to be identified, particularly in regard to behavior, the assumption must be made that there is a cause at all (Green, 1987). In this case, the Biological is similar to the Psychodynamic approach.<nl>Another core assumption of the Biological approach, and perhaps the most important assumption in this approach, is the idea that many if not all behavioral characteristics are due to internal biological processes. This can include hormones, neuronal activity, and the genetic make up of an individual, as well as externally caused internal reactions such as brain damage (Kolb &amp; Whishaw, 2008). One way psychologists can study biological causes of behavior is through direct observation as the phenomena occur. Methods of this include brain scans such as MRI, ECG and EEG, and less brain-focused methods such as blood tests (Kalat, 2017). However, these methods can be quite invasive and are not always valid methods of measuring the inner-most structures of the brain. To address this issue, post-mortem studies are conducted (Groves &amp; Rebec, 1992). This is a key feature of the Biological approach where the brains of individuals, often with abnormal brain processes, are studied after death to observe the physical structure of these brains. As biological processes often take place on a scale too small to directly observe, biological psychologists often must resort to making inferences based on observable data, another key feature of the approach. <nl>A final core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is the idea of the evolutionary explanation for certain behaviors. The Darwinian theory of evolution features heavily in biological psychology, as some behaviors seem to be instinctual from birth. For example, particular phobias can be observed in young children even though the participants have never had any contact with the phobic stimulus before. \u2018Ophidiophobia\u2019 is an abnormal fear of snakes, and can be seen in children who have never before had any experience with snakes (Fredrikson, Annas, Fischer, &amp; Vik, 1996). The evolutionary explanation would suggest that this fear is instinctual and has been inherited as a survival mechanism to ensure the continuation of the individual\u2019s genes (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). This core assumption is an example of the nomotheticism of the Biological approach, as the theory of heredity of behavior is generalized to the entirety of humanity, as well as other species.<nl>The Biological and the Psychodynamic approaches both have weaknesses, some shared between the two approaches, some differing. Whilst Biopsychology takes a wider idiographic approach to behavior which can be considered to be overly simplistic and excessively generalized, the Psychodynamic approach uses an individual\u2019s childhood experiences to explain behavior, an idiographic method which may be considered to be too subjective to qualify as anything more than pseudoscience.      The Biological approach uses the strictly monitored scientific method to prove hypotheses, using empirical data to demonstrate causational relationships between biological processes and behavioral phenomena (Breedlove &amp; Watson, 2013), whereas elements of the Psychodynamic approach uses methods that are dependent on the subjective interpretations of the psychologist using them, for example dream analysis (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), making it difficult to form concrete theories about certain behaviors.  <nl><nl>However, some assumptions of the two approaches can be seen as strengths of the different schools of thought. For example, the quantification of data used in many areas of Biopsychological research enables the results to be carefully and extensively analyzed to find correlations between variables and behavioral traits, and often lead to identifying causational relationships for feelings and behavior. The Psychodynamic approach uses more qualitative research which can be useful when producing Psychoanalytical treatments for individual patients. <nl><nl>Also, the Biological approach takes a more utilitarian view towards psychology as a science. This means that the research conducted by Biological psychologists is focused around the practical uses of the results. It could be argued that this is partly due to the high financial cost of biological research, which requires grants and funding from organizations that would benefit from the results. The Psychodynamic approach has a more psychological purity point of view when it comes to research, meaning that some of the research and theories are produced purely for the philosophical understanding of behavior (Clark, 1980). For example, it could be argued that the theory of personality structure has very limited practical use as the Id, Ego and Superego cannot be directly interfered with, even though it is a possible explanation to help psychologists understand behavior.<nl>To conclude, both the Biological and the Psychoanalytic have some similar key features and core assumptions, and others that differ between the two. Each perspective has its own strengths and weaknesses and their own practical applications. Inevitably there will always be individuals who strongly disagree with one or the other, but given the chance each approach has something to offer modern view of psychology.<nl>", "positive": "Dear Mrs Botago, I've done some research into some of the top places in Helsinki you might want to try whilst you're there,and I'll copy in the bookings team so they have the addresses if you want them.

{"anchor": "Pregnancy loss is often silenced and shamed whether it\u2019s miscarriages, termination for medical reasons or stillborn deaths (Keane, 2009). This essay will focus specifically on miscarriages in the first trimester because of the stigma surrounding the validation of mourning a \u2018human that didn\u2019t exist\u2019. This essay will also explore the discussions around motherhood, why women feel they are labelled \u2018failed mothers\u2019, and recommendations to reduce the stigma around early miscarriages.<nl>Motherhood has been the central and imperative role in a woman\u2019s life. In a woman\u2019s lifetime, she is expected to reproduce in order to fulfil the responsibility of \u2018bearers of the collective\u2019. The importance of being the \u2018bearers of the collective\u2019 ensures that reproduction allows society to function, and never \u2018die out\u2019. Because of this duty, these expectations have shaped women\u2019s identities to believe all women will become mothers. Early miscarriages go against the concept of motherhood, and for this reason, there is stigmatisation around miscarriages. Stigma is defined as an \u2018attribute that is deeply discrediting\u2019 (Goffman, 1963:3), hence the shame and silence around miscarriages. Because of this stigma and duty placed on women, miscarriages deem women to be \u2018failed mothers\u2019.<nl>Many women believe they\u2019ll have a successful pregnancy and start to prepare for the new addition. However, not all pregnancies are successful. In fact, \u2018first trimester miscarriages are by far the most frequent type of pregnancy loss\u2019 (Layne, 2000:325). When a miscarriage occurs, no one is to blame, however, the blame tends to fall on the woman (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Blame-shifting is a central factor of the stigmatisation around early miscarriages. The blame goes to the extent of the woman also accepting the blame, and believing she was the cause of the miscarriage (Miller, 2015). Moreover, the blame reinforces her inabilities as she renders herself incapable and questions whether something is wrong with her (Miller, 2015; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). A study conducted by Abboud &amp; Liamputtong (2002) found that participants were blamed for their activities which allegedly caused their miscarriage. For example, a participant stated, \"They blame me that it\u2019s my fault, that when I was pregnant, I was dancing, that I wasn\u2019t eating properly. It\u2019s my fault that this happened\" (2002:47). However, according to Sandford Health, it\u2019s essential to exercise to combat the fatigue and hormonal changes during the first trimester (Seitz, 2019). Furthermore, the search for reasoning in early miscarriages causes blame-shifting on the woman, in which she accepts she has failed her duty to be the bearer of the collective, and essentially she is seen as a failed mother.<nl>As aforementioned, the blame allows the woman to accept the moral responsibility of the demise, but realistically she has failed an expectation which is uprooted in intensive motherhood. Intensive motherhood is the philosophy of maximising the potential of a person to become a better version of themselves. In this case, women have adapted to this belief through the understanding of gender roles. Gender roles have set in stone that women are to be housewives and mothers, and from a young age, girls are taught how to cook and nurture. A participant stated that \"the illusion is created not during the pregnancy, but when we are small girls, when we\u2019re still playing with dolls, we already think about being mothers, about children, because it\u2019s in our nature\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:16). The bonding with dolls maximises the potential for young girls to become mothers in the future. In addition, the act of bonding is extended in pregnancy which develops attachment between the woman and the foetus. However, miscarriages interrupt the bonding process that women have adopted since they were young, leaving them confused and empty. The impact of intensive motherhood allows women to develop the \u2018picture-perfect\u2019 family idea and believe having children fulfils their purpose of being a woman. In essence, the woman\u2019s identity is defined by her ability to conceive. <nl>The intensive motherhood belief also implies that women have to become mothers, and this contributes to the reason why women try again after a miscarriage to maintain the responsibility of the bearer of the collective. A husband of a participant in the Abboud &amp; Liamputtong study said that \"she kept trying\u2026she insisted\u2026she wanted a boy, like all the other women\" and this was due to his wife feeling she needed a baby to please her husband (2002:54). This implies that miscarriages make women feel they\u2019re inadequate wivespartners, as well as inadequate women, and in order to change that, they must conceive. This also echoes the discussion that motherhood validates a woman\u2019s place in society. Becoming a mother makes a woman an accepted person in society and even in her family home. All in all, intensive motherhood prepares women for the position they play in society \u2013 which is to become mothers. Until they do so, they\u2019re \u2018failed mothers\u2019 or \u2018deviant women\u2019. <nl>Intensive motherhood works symbiotically with the policing of women\u2019s bodies and behaviours. The first trimester of pregnancies is labelled as the \u2018risky period\u2019 (first 12 weeks) because this is when early miscarriages occur. For this reason, women are told to not get \u2018too excited\u2019 until the first trimester has passed. This period controls the woman\u2019s experience of pregnancy due to biomedical framings. Rothman quoted in Ross (2015) states that \u2018demands are placed on women to emotionally distance themselves from the pregnancy, and suspend experiences of attachment to the foetus until \u2018it is deemed worth keeping\u2019. For first time pregnancies, holding in excitement is almost impossible, therefore this biomedical framing creates a sense of uncertainty. Shildrick quoted in Ross (2015) argues that women\u2019s bodies have been labelled as inferior. This implies that medical input has superiority over the woman\u2019s body and makes it their obligation to know what\u2019s right for her. Due to the \u2018risky period\u2019, women tend to keep the news to themselves and remain quiet about their pregnancy. Additionally, because of stigmatisation around early miscarriages, women refrain from announcing the news of their pregnancy to avoid announcing that they miscarried, and this is to avoid felt stigma and the actual stigma itself. Furthermore, women felt that society\u2019s conventions around hiding a pregnancy until after the first trimester meant they felt alone and isolated in their feelings (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:7). Overall, the biomedical framings have created a scare around the first trimester in order to avoid the stigmatisation of being labelled a failed mother.<nl>Policing of women\u2019s behaviours and bodies has become a routinized process, and women themselves believe every medical input is necessary during the pregnancy. During pregnancy, women are told what to eat and drink, especially at antenatal appointments. Undoubtedly, antenatal appointments have the intention of ensuring the health of the woman and the baby is prioritised, but there are elements of policing and monitoring her behaviours. For a first time pregnancy, up to 10 antenatal appointments are expected, and 7 for those who have had a child already (NHS, 2020), and these appointments \u2018feature detailed discussions of women\u2019s behaviours and encouragement to modify those seen as posing a risk to the pregnancy\u2019 (Ross, 2015:330). These modifications allow women to think that if she doesn\u2019t follow these rules, she is the cause of the miscarriage. In fact, most women follow the instructions of pregnancy, yet many still suffer miscarriages in the first trimester. These instructions imply that medical attention plays their part to also maximise the potential of a woman becoming a mother. Over time, women\u2019s bodies have become the embodiment of distrust therefore medical attention during pregnancy is a core contribution to the transition from womanhood to motherhood, to avoid having a miscarriage. In brevity, if these rules are followed, it\u2019s believed there are slim chances of miscarriages, and if they aren\u2019t followed, a woman causes her miscarriage and she is a failed mother.<nl>The \u2018risky period\u2019 (12 weeks of gestation) can pose implications that the foetus isn\u2019t an actual human until birth, therefore mourning a miscarriage tends to be unrecognised. The validity of the foetus can be discussed through the concept of foetal personhood. Foetal personhood raises questions in the validation of a woman\u2019s loss as some would regard the foetus as \u2018medical waste\u2019. Martel\u2019s study (2014) found that in Canada, pregnancies ending under 20 weeks gestation andor under the birth weight of 500 grams are not registered with Statistics Canada or issued a birth or death certificate. This indicates that foetuses shouldn\u2019t be honoured like newborn babies, due to the fact that \u2018miscarriage is not socially recognised in the same way that the loss of a born baby or family member might be\u2019 (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:2).<nl>Medical technologies, such as ultrasounds and sonograms encourage the foetus to be seen as \u2018real\u2019, from a foetus to a baby. These technologies allow women to become attached to the foetus, and when the miscarriage occurs, the woman feels a great loss due to the bonding formed in the first trimester, and accept that the pregnancy loss is also real. In reality, some women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant until they take pregnancy tests. They can assume the miscarriage is a delayed period, but the role of medical technologies encourages women to think of their \u2018wished-for child as a person\u2019 (Layne quoted in Keane 2009). Similarly, the assumption of the mother role is strengthened by hospital visits and medical technologies because the woman assumes she is a mother. The definition of a mother is \"a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth to\" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2002), and in the case of early miscarriages, this raises questions as to whether the woman who miscarried can mourn as if she were a mother. Nevertheless, whether the woman should be seen as a mother or not, the imagining of the child-to-be should validate her reasoning to feel the loss. The \u2018construction of the \u2018child\u2019 is created by social actors (the parents) whose identities are shaped by being in a family relationship with them, and without this construction, the \u2018child\u2019 cannot exist\u2019 (Mullin, 2015:32). Moreover, Mullin (2015) argues that although the foetus didn\u2019t reach its full potential, it had the potential to do so, therefore the loss of a miscarried foetus should be recognised. Undeniably, the part medical technologies play in foetal personhood reinforces early miscarriages as a failure. The dismissal of recognition for miscarried foetuses further embodies that women who miscarry are failed mothers, as their miscarried foetus isn\u2019t commemorated and is seen as \u2018medical waste\u2019.<nl>As previously mentioned, early miscarriages are regarded as medical waste, which invalidates the woman\u2019s grief. The woman\u2019s emotions during and after the miscarriage can be strengthened by her friends, family and medical staff by showing a lack of support, which further emphasises the woman labelled as a failed mother. Bellhouse\u2019s study (2018) found that previous research shows that women affected by miscarriages feel a lack of recognition of their loss, as well as emotional support from those close to them. It is understandable that the woman\u2019s support bubble may not understand her loss, but the emotional distance makes the woman feel alone. Some people around the woman encourage her to \u2018get over it\u2019 and forget about it, and urge her to try again. In Gerber-Epstein\u2019s study (2008), a woman\u2019s family had the tendency to insist her to return back to normality and try again. Another woman in the study recalled a doctor saying \"\u2026you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about, you\u2019ll have a bleed in a few days.\" (2008:11). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong\u2019s study (2002), a woman\u2019s husband said \"\u2026the doctor said a couple of weeks and back to normal life and you can have a baby next month\" (2002:47). The lack of recognition of the woman\u2019s grief and healing is prevalent around early miscarriages, which downplays her mourning. These quotes also reveal that women have to constantly work on fulfilling the responsibility of the bearers of the collective, despite what may be going on around them.<nl>Women who have suffered early miscarriages feel shame and embarrassment from their social circle. Some go as far as making insensitive comments and finding the silver lining in the miscarriage. In Bellhouse\u2019s study, they found that \"approximately half of the women expressed feeling that others often did not understand their experience and therefore struggled to empathise with them and support them at the time of their miscarriage, leading to feelings of hurt and disappointment\"(2018:5). People said to a participant in Bellhouse\u2019s study \"oh you know, you\u2019ll get pregnant again\u2019, or, um, \u2018oh it was meant to be\" (2018:6). Apart from the insensitive comments, people found ways to blame women for their life choices and activities (e.g. working too hard) as a reason for the miscarriage (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). The shame and embarrassment also extend to women over the age of 30 that miscarry. Although there is no set age for childbearing, it is believed that childbearing rates start to fall low in women over the age of 30 (Noord-Zaadstra, et al., 1991). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong\u2019s study, a participant\u2019s husband stated \"\u2026she was crazy to get pregnant again. In her mind she was too old, and it\u2019s very hard to get pregnant again with her age and menopause\" (2002:53). The woman in the study was between the ages of 37-38, yet she felt she had to prove to her husband her capability to become a mother. Furthermore, this reveals older women experience the stigma of being a failed mother, seeing as they\u2019re nearing the age of menopause. The lack of support from family and friends of the woman suffering from the miscarriage strengthens her label as a \u2018failed mother\u2019 as many fail to legitimise her feelings, instead they urge her to try again, rather than allowing her to grieve and heal.<nl>The aftermath of early miscarriages makes women experience feelings such as helplessness, sadness, guilt, irritability, repeated recollection of the experience and fear (Walker &amp; Davidson quoted in Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Many women who experience an early miscarriage feel they\u2019re worthless, disabled, and inadequate (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008; Ross, 2015). During this period, women can become envious of other women with children because it reminds them that they\u2019re failed mothers (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Moreover, women feel they have disappointed themselves and everyone around them. Some women go as far as opting for tubal ligation and adoption seeing as they\u2019re unable to conceive. A woman revealed she and her partner were planning tubal ligation to prevent future pregnancies as she had suffered seven miscarriages (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Similarly, another woman said \"I was already thinking I ought to adopt a child, because I already said I wouldn\u2019t be able to have children\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:15). These women have accepted that they are failed mothers due to the frequency of miscarriages, and settle for alternatives. Women who have experienced early miscarriages often feel scared to get pregnant again, because they feel that their future pregnancies will result in early miscarriages. Overall, these feelings remind women of what they\u2019re not \u2013 which is a mother. Early miscarriages also remind them that they have defied the transition from womanhood to motherhood, and they have failed the duty of the bearers of the collective.  <nl>These feelings tend to go unnoticed and untreated by the woman\u2019s support bubble and medical staff, and if left ignored, it can haunt the woman for a long time (Frost, et al., 2007). It\u2019s important that women who have suffered early miscarriages feel they\u2019re not failed mothers, neither are they alone. In regards to family and friends, it\u2019s important for them to speak about the miscarriage so the woman isn\u2019t the only one acknowledging the loss. A woman and her husband found that speaking about the miscarriage helped her grieving process (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002), and women who spoke to other women who had miscarried felt it helped them (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). It\u2019s also vital that the woman\u2019s family and friends are willing to listen to her, and allow her to mourn at her own pace (Bellhouse, et al., 2018; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Creating memories are just as important because it acknowledges the loss, rather than forgetting the miscarriage. A couple found it helpful to take their miscarried babies to their house to create memories and reminders (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Other women found comfort in commemorating their miscarriage through pregnancy loss websites where the miscarried children are represented in the form of angels (Keane, 2009).<nl>Medical care needs to devote time for counselling and support for women after miscarriages to help them process the miscarriage, as well as being sensitive and reassuring (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Women also feel medical care should provide more information and knowledge on miscarriages so women understand how common it is (Frost, et al., 2007; Bellhouse, et al., 2018). In addition, society needs to acknowledge the loss so women don\u2019t feel stigmatised. Suggestions such as public speeches, talks, and medical conferences can lessen the silence around early miscarriages (Frost, et al., 2007). Most importantly, it\u2019s important to stop the blame-shifting onto women who miscarry (Frost, et al., 2007), and to stop the tradition of secrecy during the first trimester of pregnancy (the \u2018risky period\u2019). These recommendations will help women know they\u2019re not failed mothers. Educating society and women\u2019s support bubbles will improve the healing process for women.<nl>In conclusion, society\u2019s expectations for women as bearers of the collective has allowed women to believe they\u2019re failed mothers when they miscarry. The culture of blame-shifting contributes to women feeling invalidated until they become mothers. The lack of emotional and physical support following an early miscarriage emphasises the silence and stigmatisation around it. In order to overcome this, more information needs to be provided to society and women affected, to reassure them that they are not failed mothers.", "positive": " <addr10_FN>,<nl><nl>Once again thank you so much for your help last week.

{"anchor": "The question to what extent to which English Laws general hostility towards good faith in commercial contracts is justifiable within the modern day has been subjected to disapproval by some judges. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd Bingham L.J. noted that \u2018in many legal systems outside the common law world, the law of obligations recognises and enforces an overriding principle that in making and carrying out contracts parties should act in good faith\u2019 but English law has decided not to adopt a good faith obligation but rather \u2018developed piecemeal solutions in response to demonstrated problems of unfairness.\u2019 The courts in England are more concerned with commercial certainty rather than parties being just towards one another. <nl><nl>This essay will argue that the hostility towards good faith obligations within commercial contracts cannot be justified in the modern day and that there should be a good faith principle introduced in English Law. It will begin by discussing the current law in relation to good faith and explain how an overriding principle of good faith will be beneficial to the parties in commercial contracts. It will then suggest the reasons why in this day and age it is important for there to be an obligation of good faith within commercial contracts and give examples of the English law\u2019s current recognition of implied and express good faith obligations. Finally, it will look at the general principles of the UK courts such as party autonomy and commercial certainty and explore how they can still be preserved with an obligation of good faith. <nl><nl>Good faith is the notion that those within contracts will act fairly towards one another. They will \u2018put all their cards face upwards on the table\u2019 and trade in a way that is open and fair.<nl>Traditionally good faith is not an overriding principle in English Law as the courts prefer for there to be certainty within commercial contracts as opposed to fairness. They are particularly against imposing broad good faith obligations. The reasons for this include the fact that it can cause uncertainty because if there was an obligation to act in good faith this can sometimes go against what the terms of the contract include. The parties can usually only go to court if one party does not fulfil their end of the contract. Furthermore, good faith can be seen as subjective as every person will have a different view of what good faith is and sometimes one judge may go too far and start siding with one party which would cause the other party a loss and so it would be difficult to find a middle point where it is suitable for both parties to not be at a complete loss. Another reason as to why the English courts prefer not to have a good faith obligation is because it makes them a lot more attractive to global businesses since they are one of the main countries without a good faith obligation. This allows for those wanting to get into commercial contracts to be more certain about the outcomes if anything was to go wrong. English law also prefers for there to be party autonomy as it allows both parties to be able to choose which law will govern their contract.  This allows for an enhanced level of certainty and predictability because both parties will be able to choose which laws best suit them. The parties also have freedom of contract which gives each party the freedom to enter into a contract and decide what terms to include. <nl><nl>Rather than an actual good faith principal English law prefers to adopt piecemeal solutions which are used for certain situations where it is seen as necessary. These will usually arise in fiduciary relationships, contracts of insurance and contracts of partnerships and employment. These include contractual interpretation where the courts will look at the intention of the parties rather than a strict interpretation of the words used in the contract.  Another instance where the courts might decide to use piecemeal solutions is when an unfair act amounts to promissory estoppel. Misrepresentation is another example where the courts might use piecemeal solutions. In some contracts such as ones where fiduciary duties are assumed there is a duty to consider the other party\u2019s interests. The party assuming the fiduciary duties will be obligated to not act dishonestly and cannot allow their interests to clash with those of their principle.  <nl><nl>Within the terms of a contract a party is allowed to include an express term to act or negotiate in good faith. This will mean both parties will have to act and negotiate in good faith and the courts will uphold this term as it is written in the contract if it is breached by either party. In Berkeley Community Villages Ltd v Pullen, it was held that an agreement would be enough to create a contractual obligation for the parties to act in good faith. This approach was also used in CPC Group Ltd v Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co by Vos J. who stated that \u2018the obligation of utmost good faith in the [contract]was to adhere to the spirit of the contract \u2026. And to observe reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, in the shortest possible time, and to be faithful to the agreed common purpose, and to act consistently with the justified expectations of the parties.\u2019 There is an increased amount of recognition for express terms to act in good faith in commercial contracts and many judges will uphold the term because their concern is ensuring the terms of the contract are not breached. This means that if a party wants a good faith obligation in their contract then they just have to include one as a term of the contract but if the other party does not want a goof faith obligation imposed on them then it can cause some issues for the parties as it could be assumed that the other party may not have the intention to act fairly and that is the reason why they don\u2019t want a good faith obligation in the contract. However, if there was a good faith obligation then this would ensure that both the parties have to act fairly towards one another which would almost eliminate the party\u2019s having bad intentions entering the contract as they know if they act upon their bad intentions then they will have to face the consequences in court. In the past there has been attempts by judges to introduce a good faith principle that extends to all contracts. In 1766 Lord Mansfield declared that \u2018[t]he governing principle is applicable to all contracts and dealings. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain, from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. But either party may be innocently silent, as to grounds open to both, to exercise their judgment upon.\u2019 However this outlook did not last long as the courts favoured party autonomy and sanctity of contract more.  It is useful for parties to have an express term to act in good faith in their contract as it would allow them to resolve a problem that might happen in the future using a good faith mechanism rather than use an expensive third-party tool. Having an express term to negotiate or act in good faith will allow parties to plan ahead in the event of an uncontrollable event happening such as the market crashing or an economic recession. In the event this does happen the parties will be able to discuss how they can continue to keep working with each other and how they will uphold their side of the agreement. It is becoming very common to find good faith clauses within contracts in the modern day which suggests that many people want to trade in good faith and would not be opposed to a good faith obligation as a lot of those in commercial contracts have willingly decided to include a good faith clause in their contracts. <nl><nl>Good faith may sometimes be implied by law in certain contracts as a term that must be followed. It is often needed in order for the contract to run smoothly. It is not implied based upon the intentions of the parties, rather because of the contractual relationship between the two parties.The different types of contracts it can be implied in include employment contracts, contracts of sale and goodwill as well as partnerships and contracts with fiduciary duties. Another way good faith can be implied is through fact. This is done to give importance to the intention of the parties in the contract. It is often implied based on necessity and obviousness. The case of Yam Seng Pte v International Trade Corp Ltd was significant in discussing whether there was an implied obligation that both parties will act in good faith with each other. Lord Leggart J. had agreed that the terms in the contract were enough to imply good faith and he also argued in favour of \u2018the implication of a term requiring good faith in performance\u2019 not only in just relational contracts but most commercial contracts based on the expectations of both parties. The fact that English law already has many instances where it uses pockets of good faith proves that a good faith principle would prove to be useful for parties entering into a contract as it is already used in several types of contracts and contractual relations. Many other countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Australia have a good faith principle in place which means that it is possible for the United Kingdom to have one too without the worry of wondering how they will execute such a principle. Although, the English courts might argue that having an obligation of good faith will take away from the party\u2019s freedom of contract and party autonomy, this can be disputed with the fact that the Canadian Supreme Court has said \u2018the principle of good faith must be applied in a manner that is consistent with the fundamental commitments of the common law of contract which generally places great weight on the freedom of contracting parties to pursue their individual self-interest.\u2019 The English courts can follow a similar approach and apply the principle in a way that will still allow those in commercial contracts their contractual freedom whilst also ensuring that they deal in a way that is honest, fair and truthful to the other party. <nl><nl>The introduction of a good faith obligation will allow parties to feel more reassured that if the other party was to act in bad faith towards them, then they will at least have support from the courts. The party who acted in bad faith would be required to give compensation to the other party in order to correct their wrongdoings. The English courts are already accepting of a good faith clause within contracts and also state that there is a duty to act in good faith in certain types of relationships. This suggests that they may be open to the idea of introducing a legally binding principle of good faith. The law has developed in regard to express terms to negotiate in good faith since the case of Walford v Miles where the House of Lords had stated that promises to negotiate or not sell were unenforceable and rejected that the opposing party were under an obligation to act in good faith. Lord Acknew has stated that \u2018a bare agreement to negotiate was not enforceable, as it lacked the necessary certainty.  It was no more than an (unenforceable) \u2018agreement to agree\u2019. However, in Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras it was held that if there was an express term to negotiate in good faith then it is enforceable. Whilst Longmore LJ had expressed that there were three objections to negotiate in good faith, he also stated that these objections did not completely prevent enforceability. He claimed that the first objection had carried little weight because normally the express obligation would have been enforceable. The second objection would be difficult to determine as it is unlikely the courts will be able to decide when the breach of the term had amounted to good faith and unless fraud was involved then it is likely the court would not consider the other party had acted in bad faith. In regard to the third objection Longmore LJ stated it would be difficult to find out exactly how much loss had occurred as a result of the breach. The development in the law after both of these cases suggests that judges are more accepting of good faith clauses and they are not seen as unenforceable \u2018agreements to agree\u2019. The general view of judges in recent times agree with Longmore LJ and believe it would be \u2018quite wrong\u2019 for the courts to deem an express clause to negotiate in good faith as unenforceable. <nl><nl>It can be argued that introducing a good faith principle will undermine party autonomy and freedom of contract, but this can be easily resolved by using a method of enforcement similar to Canada when it comes to good faith. If the English courts enforce good faith, then they should limit the amount they get involved in order to preserve the freedom of parties. If the courts introduce a good faith clause then it should be \u2018capable of being given legal content\u2019. A good faith obligation would lead to fair dealing and less attempts of people acting in bad faith towards others. It would allow for more trust between parties as they will have more hope that it is unlikely the other party will act unfairly and unjustly towards them. <nl><nl>In conclusion there should be a good faith principle introduced in English law as it will reassure those entering commercial contracts that if they were to enter a contract then the other party will have to act towards them in good faith and trade fairly with them. Parties can also be reassured that the courts would help them if the other party acted in bad faith towards them. There is also an increase in the amount of people in commercial contracts including clauses to act or negotiate in good faith towards one another. This proves that many people are going out of their way to include these clauses as it can be seen as a form of protection. Many international courts have a good faith obligation in place, and it does not take away from the freedom parties have, rather it enhances their security and lessens the chances of them being scammed. This is because the other party will less likely want to act in bad faith if they know the implications of their actions if taken to court. Whilst it is likely the courts will have some reservations or concerns towards a good faith obligation; they can look at how international courts implement the obligation. This will help them to keep a balance between doing too much or too little whilst maintaining the general principles of English commercial law.", "positive": "nly had \u00a33 in coins<new>Do u want me to get it<new>How old is he<new>This is 7-8<new>That\u2019s fine<new>Going to eat with <pers_FN> at 2 ish<new>I\u2019m going to do some revision now<new>Not going to savers after my lecture because I\u2019m hungry and tired<new>Doctors going to ring me at 2<new>They don\u2019t want to see the patients<new>What does that say<new>Write the food parcels pak<new>Okay I\u2019ll do it when I come down<new>I\u2019m getting help<new>Not sure<new>Just saw it<new>Brough a dress \u00a35<new>That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do now<new>She said the vacancy has been filled<new>Awww thank you so much mom\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "attacked": "nly had \u00a33 in coins <new> Do u want me to get it <new>How old is he<new>This is 7-8<new>Thats fine<new>Going to eat with <pers_FN> at 2 ish<new>I'm going to do some revision now <new>Not going to saves after my lecture because I'm hungry and tired <new>Doctors are going to ring me at 2 <new>You don't want to see the patients <new>What does this <new>Write the food packages pak<new>Okay I-ll do it when I come down <new>I'm getting help <new>Not sure<new>Only saw it <new>Brough a dress \u00a35<new>What I'm going to do now <new>She said that the void was filled <new>Awww Thank you so much Mom------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "attack_type": "back_translation"}

{"anchor": "Subjective Expected Utility theory is a normative theory of decision making (Neumann &amp; Morganstern, 1944; Savage, 1954). There are five axioms of SEU theory, first there is a preference for decisions to be well ordered so between two options, there should be a preference. The second axiom is preferences should be transitive so if summer is preferred over winter and winter over spring then summer should be preferred over autumn. The third axiom is if there is an indifference between two options, the probability of them being chosen is equal. Fourth is if there is a preference for one option over another so A over B, if presented with two outcomes where one is the first choice leads to A and the second to B, the first option should be chosen. The last axiom is no alternative is infinitely better than any other. These axioms must be fulfilled to assign utilities to outcomes so the expected utility in any decision can be maximised. From the five axioms, the principle of transitivity is derived which is having a preference of option x to y and y to z leading to a preference of x to z. However, Tversky\u2019s (1969) found that preferences are not always transitive and therefore goes against the SEUT.<nl> To account for the violations of the SEU theory the Prospect theory (Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979) was proposed which explains that decision making is based upon personal gains and loss aversions. Therefore, predicting the potential decision to be chosen is difficult due to the probability of the decision being picked being distorted as probabilities are over weighted.<nl>Deviations can also be explained by regret theory which found that large differences are over weighted whilst small differences between outcomes are underweighted. Regret theory is also based upon emotions such as disappointment, rejoicing, regret and elation which are anticipated when a result of a decision is known. How the amount of this emotion does not reflect the difference between outcomes accurately.", "positive": "y perfect, thank you <new>Thank you!<new>Hi, i'm just wondering is there any update with my placement application as i know lockdown and corona are creating complications around placements at the moment.<new>Hi <addr3_FN>, I have applied to a couple placements and I'm just slightly worried due to corona and placements as the main placement I would like is <school>.

They are produced in circumstances of rest, especially when your eyes are closed and happen before you fall asleep (Alpha Waves and How They Help You Sleep, n.d.). <nl>The AIH is supported with research such as (Handel et al., 2011) who used a MEG (magneto-encephalogram) which has better spatial resolution and similar temporal resolution to an EEG for better results. They found that alpha activity is reduced in contralateral brain areas to the stimuli presented, that alpha activity is influenced by attention. <nl>A partial replication of Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) experiment: \"A shift of visual spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\", was conducted to compare alpha amplitudes at P3 between conditions and prove the hypothesis that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. As stimuli always processes contralaterally (opposite side of activity) We wanted to find out whether if, a side of the visual field was cued, would it lead to alpha inhibition on the contralateral side where participants anticipated the stimuli would appear? And which side would show bigger alpha amplitudes?<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>38 undergraduate students took part in the research via volunteer sampling, there were originally 39, but one participant\u2019s data were removed as their data were only available for one of the two conditions. <nl>Design<nl>The design of the study was a repeated measure, the independent variable was whether the arrow cues pointed left or right, it also had two levels known as cue left and cue right. The dependent variable was the alpha amplitudes measured in \u00b5V (microvolts), recorded from P3.<nl>Materials<nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to collect data and EEG Electrodes were attached to participants\u2019 scalps using AC cream, Everi cream. PsychoPy software was used to present stimuli for a specific period of time and send event markers set to end immediately to Biopac, through a Stimtracker device. The Stimuli used were two white bars on a black background, one large, one small (see figure 1). Two arrows, one pointing left and one pointing right (see figure 2). And white fixation cross (see figure 3). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Firstly, the Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz, digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and Stimtracker, event markers let us know when stimuli were shown. Calculation channels were set up to record activity in the alpha frequency range from 8-13Hz before checking the impedance, with the sampling rate being 1000 Hz, alpha amplitudes were also measured.  Participants had EEG electrodes with AC cream on them placed on their scalps using the 1020 positioning system (Trans-Cranial Techologies.,2012), with P3 being recorded. The active electrode was placed at P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz, an earth electrode was attached to the forehead near the hairline and everything was measured relative to Cz.The areas were scrubbed with Everi cream beforehand for better adhesion. They were then asked to complete a cued visual attention task using PsychoPy. <nl>Cued with a fixation cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms an arrow indicating whether it would be the left or right side of the visual field the target, would appear, in the centre of the screen for 34ms whilst participants were asked by the experimenter to focus their attention to that side of the visual field. There was 50% chance of being cued left or right. There were different event markers for cue left and right conditions and they were sent at stimulus onset. There were 20 blocks of 4 trial types, each block had cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) randomised within blocks with half of trials cued left and half cued right. <nl><nl>Results<nl>The raw 9-13Hz Alpha EEG data for each condition was analysed using the event markers sent from PsychoPy to identify when the stimuli would be presented. We looked at the period of 200ms of recorded activity before stimulus presentation, after arrow cues had been shown and used Biopac by rectifying and averaging over 50 samples of raw alpha data to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. This smooths out the data (averaging over samples), reduces the impact of outlyingextreme values and converts negative values to positive, so we get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. <nl>Statistical Analysis<nl>Table 1 shows that the rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were higher in the cue left condition than the cue right condition. According to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the difference was significant, and the inferential statistics are as follows (t=566, n=38, p&lt;0.005). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were significant, so we used a non-parametric test to find the inferential statistics from the data collected. The results fit with the hypothesis as the results are consistent with AIH as recorded activity from P3cue left were higher than cue right, which were the task irrelevant brain areas, suggesting that alpha suppression happened there.<nl>Methodological issues that could have affected the results could have been varying levels of impedance, associated with more variance in the measurements but would affect both conditions equally. Another methodological issue that could have affected results could have been artefacts, such as blinking, that would affect the waves. From the experiment overall, I conclude that the AIH is highly supported by research as it has high temporal reliability, and despite all the methodological issues, the results are still valid.\"", "positive": " I just wanted to find out for my placement applications<new>Oh okay, thanks dad<new>What time is auntie <pers_FN>\u2019s funeral please?<new>Okay, thanks dad \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019ve just messaged her<new>Hi dad, how are you?

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>In order to analyse to what extent English law\u2019s approach to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith is satisfactory, it important to understand that the fundamental attitude towards good faith and the recent developments in good faith, that lead to a paradox within the law.  In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd , Lord Bingham defined what good faith is synonymic to, which was \"playing fair\", \"coming clean\" or \"putting one\u2019s card face upwards on the table\". This approach has been embodied by most countries outside the common law world, whereby, there is an overriding principle of good faith. However, English law, tends to abide by a piecemeal technique, which means good faith is applied as and when it is needed, rather than a general law. Nonetheless, the courts have more recently signalled a departure from such approach, as it has become increasingly more common for courts to uphold the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, and in doing so, have caused a level of uncertainty within the law.<nl>This essay will argue that the approach Courts have taken to enforce promises to negotiate in good faith is in fact unsatisfactory. This essay develops, first, by explaining the general obligations of good faith and the traditional hostility towards it. Secondly, it will focus specifically on the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith and, whether, in fact, this has been enforceable. Finally, it will be explained that, despite the attempts to define what the Courts will uphold in relation to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate, it inevitably leads to courts being too involved in commercial business and therefore, undermines the commercial stability that England places on high importance.<nl><nl>Traditional Views Towards Good Faith<nl>Historically, hostility towards the doctrine of good faith has been prevalent in English law.  Traditionally, English law develops piecemeal solution in response to the specific problems they are faced with, rather than an imposing an overriding principle of good faith. The reasoning, for this, is it creates too much uncertainty and subjectivity, but arguably, more importantly, it allows for freedom of contract and party of autonomy. As put by, Sir Roy Goode \"in what we like to think \u2013 perhaps wrongly \u2013 is the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice. It is necessary in a commercial setting that businessmen at least should know where they stand.\" Thus, indicating, why the original approach to good faith, is satisfactory because it leads to commercial certainty, which is ingrained into English law. This is fundamental to the core, further evidenced, by the fact \"the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice.\"  <nl>Conversely, this certainty that is placed on such high importance in English law, is being undermined by the exceptions where English law does recognise good faith, one of them being express promises to negotiate in good faith. Thus, meaning it is enforceable in courts. Many of these express terms to negotiate are based on the perception that both parties will be entering a joint venture, as there would be an intention to create a long term relation and parties may set out commitments for a specific time. The declarations made in the House of Lords decisions of HIH Casualty v Chase Manhattan Bank , Lord Hoffman observes  that it goes without saying that underlying the contractual arrangement of the parties there will be a common assumption that the parties involved will behave honestly. Although, there may be express terms to negotiate in good faith, the nature of these relationships alone, should call for honest, open and fair dealing. This is considered to be a relational contract. Leggatt LJ explains that communication and co-operation is based on trust and loyalty might be crucial and impliedly expected by the parties, even if not expressly stated in contract.  However, there is an issue with this definition as it has been criticised for a lack of explanation, as put by Severine Saintier, Leggatt J does not elaborate as to what relational contracts are precisely, why they require such enhanced good faithloyalty or what this would entail, which is regrettable. Such criticism simply strengthens the Court\u2019s previously hostile approach to the doctrine; due to the ambiguity in interpretation of the doctrine as there are no guidelines as to how the Court is to identify \"good faith\", and so is often done so subjectively. <nl><nl>Express Promises To Negotiate In Good Faith<nl>Nevertheless, express terms to promise to negotiate in good faith, has been favoured and welcomed; due to the flexibility and adaptability it allows for within the contract. The freedom of inserting an article that mandates a negotiation, means that parties are able to prepare themselves for future, as the future is uncertain, they are unable to dictate what the commercial environment may look like in 20 years. For instance, events, such as a recession or a plummet in the market by including a term that opens the door for renegotiations in relation to the specific term. Cases, such as Petromec , the clause was 12.4 , where it states that \u2018 Brasoil agrees to negotiate in good faith with Petromc the extra costs..\u2019 This term emphasises why parties may include an express term in the contract for future insulation against potential risks that may occur.<nl><nl>Enforceability of Promises to Negotiate through Development of Law.<nl>Case law paves the way for the enforceability of contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, by refining the scope of good faith. Walford v Miles, the case was as follows, the business owner promised the plaintiffs that it would terminate negotiations to sell business to third party, however, the business owner then sold the business to a third party. The plaintiffs argued that the business owner had a duty to negotiate in good faith. However, it was held that the promise to negotiate was unenforceable. Lord Ackner to be \"unworkable\" and \"inherently repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in negotiations.\" It is imperative for distinctions to be made between a good faith duty which governs pre \u2013 contractual relations and of those that concern a contractual performance, as well as the contrast between terms that are expressly codified for the intrusion of a duty of good faith. In light of this intricacy, Longmore LJ took on the role of understanding the criticisms that the courts have had with upholding a promise to negotiate, he pointed out three main arguments; one of them being that the obligation is an agreement to agree and this is too uncertain to enforce.. However, he dismissed this argument by stating that is carries little weight because the obligation on the facts was an express obligation in a contract that was otherwise enforceable. By arguing, these main points Longmore LJ has narrowed the vagueness, and this is best shown in the comparison of Walford v Miles and Petromec Inc v Petroleo, in the Walford case the contract was still to come into the effect of the good faith arrangement as it was still in the pre \u2013 negotiation stage, the contract was never concluded. However, in Petromec, it was clear that it was not just a bare agreement to negotiation, as it was a complex contract drafted by their lawyers. This case, is a crucial turning point in relation to promises to negotiate in good faith, as it maintains party autonomy and freedom of contract, which as mentioned is fundamental to Englands commercial environment, therefore, allows for a consistent and coherent standard of how express terms are upheld by the courts. <nl><nl><nl>The Quota To Satisfy<nl>Shaker v Visajet, was yet another case that was consistent with the way the Courts uphold express promises to negotiate in good faith. In this case, there was a promise to \u2018proceed in good faith\u2019 as well as \u2018use reasonable endeavours\u2019 to agree a documentation pursuant to the purchase of an aircraft. Teare J stated that there was no binding legal obligation based on the promise. The reason for this was because there was \u2018no objective criteria\u2019, that the court was able to decide whether the party acted unreasonably.  This further enhances the distinction using Petromec , because in the case, there was sufficient objective criteria to make the promise enforceable. However, Shaker, meant that the courts devised a test in order to see if the express promises to negotiate is enforceable; the test requires two questions to be satisfied. The first criteria to meet is, \u2018is there a certainty of object?\u2019, this relates to clarity in what the negotiation was set out to achieve e.g. responding to a change in the circumstances. The second is \u2018 are there sufficient objective criteria to determine what a good faith negotiation looks like in the context of this particular contract?\u2019 This criteria relates to the idea that the Courts should be able to look at the contract and have the exact information to uncover, what the negotiation should look like in good faith. These cases all draw to the same conclusion that promises to negotiate in good faith should be upheld and is attempted to be done so by the Courts by using precedence, the courts should not avoid enforceability due to some vagueness, on how the term is to be upheld in practical contexts.<nl><nl>Upholding the contract leading too much involvement<nl>Parties requiring terms to be upheld and enforced necessitates a court to work out what a good faith negotiation looks like in that contract, in fact it is vital to do so, because it is the only way to conclude if there has been a breach or not. There is too much vagueness surrounding the good faith negotiation, which inevitably leads to the Courts having to fill in the blanks, in essence leading them to \u2018make\u2019 the contracts for the parties. In fact, this interpretation is considered to take up more judicial time than all other areas of the law of contract put together. Although, Lord Hoffman came up with five principles governing how the courts should interpret written contracts, there was a lot of backlash for this as it was \u2018It was said to generate uncertainty because it appeared to widen the circumstances in which the judges could depart from the \u2018natural and ordinary meaning\u2019 of the words used by the parties.\u2019 The underlying issue is that, regardless, of how precise the terms are, it will inevitably lead to courts getting too involved in interpreting the contract and assuming what the parties meant instead of what they actually wrote. This in turn generates too much uncertainty and threatens the stability of the commercial environment.<nl><nl>                                       Alternatives to solve uncertainty<nl>Although, a common option for both parties is to include an arbitration, which is an alternate way of settling a dispute outside of courts, however, this has been criticised because the existence of the arbitration obligation specifically incorporated into clause itself indicates strongly that the parties were not intending to retain their freedom to agree or disagree according to their perceived interests. More importantly, as highlighted in the Emirates Trading and Associated British Ports, it leads to satellite litigation, meaning the parties go to Court arguing about not the specific breach of the contract but a separate matter arising from this, in the Emirates Trading case, it was about whether the good faith negotiation term was in fact enforceable. Satellite litigation is undesirable and in fact takes up the Courts resources and arguably, \"tends not to help with either expedition or the saving of expense and perhaps more than anything leads to disproportionality.\" Ironically, the very reason why the express promise to negotiate was avoid long-drawn-out dispute and going to court by resolving them through friendly discussions of good faith. Thus, indicating that going to court may lead to better solutions for the parties, simultaneously, altering the position and standpoint of the traditional view held by the English courts.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>To conclude, express promises to negotiate in good faith is upholding, although it has been consistent and the requirements have been made unambiguous through case law and the enforceability by the Courts have also been constant, aiding the reliability and validity. However, the issue with the Court enforcing the express terms is that, they have to work out the good faith in the negotiation, but by doing this it means that the courts are at high risk of making the parties contracts for them. This creates the worry that the commercial stability in England would be threatened because it means party autonomy is not at the priority, as well, as freedom of contract. Both of these element are considered to be central to the English law, in relation to commercial law.

{"anchor": "Johns Case:\u2028<nl>John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010).<nl><nl>Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: <nl>John\u2019s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John\u2019s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992).<nl>Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so.<nl>John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017).<nl>As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008),  who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008).<nl><nl>John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently.\u2028<nl>John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood.<nl><nl>Coping:<nl>John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not  actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit  university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance.<nl>In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). <nl><nl>Interventions:<nl>The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and  has  little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007).<nl>Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation <nl>The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": "got 1.6k awards\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dthats more than our portfolios combined and doubled in price<new>Mut wake me at 12<new>We got work to do<new>Wake me up if gme is above 400 or below 130<new>^ if its above 250<new>Got 4hr resource booster from login lol<new>Found 8 argons in 5mins\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<new>And got enough plastids to make wukong now<new>Also free rhino skin next month for 8yr anniversary<new>That is weird<new>Inv me<new>And try<new>Lol got resource booster 4 hrs on daily login<new>If ur doing higher volumes its only \u00a31 fee<new>And zero spread<new>Ye thats minor<new>Only whilst market is this rocked", "attacked": "got 1.6k awards that combined more than our portfolios and doubled in price <new>Mut wake me up at 12 <new>We've got work to do <new>Wake me up when gme is over 400 or under 130 <new>^ when its over 250 <new>Got 4hr resource booster from Login lol <new>Found 8 Argons in 5mins <new>And got enough plastic to make Wukong now <new>Also free Rhino skin next month for 8yr anniversary <new>That's weird <new>Inv me <new>And try <new>Lol got resource booster 4 hours on daily login <new>If ur do higher amounts his only \u00a3 1 fee <new>And zero spread <new>Ye that's inferior <new>Only while market is this rocked", "attack_type": "back_translation"}

{"anchor": "1.Outline the proposed role of dopamine in the maintenance of drug use<nl>Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is associated with pleasure and reward, eating, drinking and sex are examples of reward process that stimulate dopamine production. In evolutionary terms dopamine naturally encourages behaviour that is vital to live such as eating when one is hungry. The nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area are important areas in the brain associated with production of dopamine(Lecture notes). Drugs cause a rush or high- pleasurable feelings and this results in associating the drugs with the feeling. In terms of maintenance of drug use,when drugs such as cocaine are used, dopamine levels are intense and even after use dopamine levels are still high causing one to have almost a greater feeling of \u2018pleasure\u2019 leading to intense cravings and intense. This is in comparison to the levels of dopamine produced in natural activities such as eating, after eating one is basically satisfied and the dopamine levels decrease. Dopamine levels being high leads to continued use of the drug to get the \u2018high\u2019. Additionally, it's common in long term drug users that the number of dopamine receptors decrease leading to depressive feelings.(Heshmati et al, 2015). These depressive feelings would lead to increased use of the drug to achieve the pleasurable feelings, this is a cycle and the drug use is maintained. <nl><nl>2.Outline the potential role of epigenetics in explaining familial transmission of phobias<nl>Epigenetics is defined as the change in the phenotype but the genetic code stays the same. Genes are turned off or on causing changes which are heritable, this is a result of external factors eg the environment and experiences.(Hamilton J, P: Epigenetics 2011)  A study on mice who were placed in a skinner box and electrocuted showed the familial transmission of phobias, these mice were electrocuted when placed in the skinner box, as a result they formed a phobia of being placed in a skinner box, associating the electrocution (pain) with the box. The mice then produced offspring, which were placed into the skinner box without electrocution but showed a fear response. Epigenetics is the only answer as these mice had never been electrocuted and there was no reason for them to associate pain with the skinner box. Evolutionary studies have also suggested that we are born with snake and spider phobias as our ancestors were less likely to notice them, as they are small and discreet but still harmful. Our ancestors had to be more aware of them whereas lions and bears are easy to spot.(Russell et al, 2015)<nl><nl>3.<nl>Critically evaluate the evidence that schizophrenia is caused by excess dopamine in the brain<nl>The original dopamine hypothesis stated that schizophrenia was a result of excess dopamine. Evidence to support this includes the amphetamine psychosis, which is a result of taking amphetamines.(J\u00f8rgen G et al, 2012)The symptoms of amphetamine psychosis mirror symptoms of schizophrenia. The use of amphetamines also increases the amount of dopamine in the brain so for researchers this was a direct link to schizophrenia.Also, researchers found that by giving schizophrenia sufferers small doses of dopamine their symptoms worsened. The dopamine hypothesis however is biologically reductionist, there have been studies showing that there are other factors such as the environment to schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis attempts to explain schizophrenia just in terms of biology, it simplifies and generalises when the condition is much more than biology and this can be shown in the diathesis stress model. Another weakness of the dopamine hypothesis to explain schizophrenia is the correlation is not equal causation issue. There isn't sufficient evidence to show whether schizophrenia causes high dopamine levels or high dopamine levels cause schizophrenia.<nl><nl>Outline three different brain research techniques and mention one strength and one weakness for each.<nl> Fmri- functional magnetic resonance imaging. A type of imaging technique that measures blood flow in parts of the brain when participants are asked to perform tasks. One strength of this technique is that it has high spatial resolution meaning it is able to show  part exactly of the brain exactly where the blood is being used to perform tasks. FMRI tracks blood flow, as blood flow shows that a particular part of the brain is using oxygen. A weakness of this technique is that it has poor temporal resolution, brain activity can not be tracked accurately, there is a time delay of 4 to 6 seconds, this is because an FMRI scan is not able to quickly track the change in blood flow. EEG- electroencephalography is a technique where electrodes are used to measure neural activity in the brain. Temporal resolution for this technique is excellent and you can see directly the neural activity in the brain, however a weakness for EEG would be the fact it doesn't tell us anything about brain structures and the dynamics of the brain it just shows electrical potential in the brain. (Sturzbecher M.J., de Araujo D.B. (2012))The third research technique is MEG- Magnetoencephalography, it measures the magnetic field that are produced in the brain, this technique is much better in comparison to EEG in terms of spatial resolution, parts of the brain can be localised well however a massive issue is the fact that this technique is expensive and not economic that's why it is so rare.<nl><nl>2.Describe the stress response, with reference to both the neural and hormonal components<nl>The stress response is also called the fight or flight response, this is the body\u2019s biological process to stress. This is triggered by something that could cause harm and our body is deciding to literally fight or flight, this is in order to survive.When the threat is recognised, the hypothalamus triggers the autonomous nervous system,which is rapid, and the endocrine system which is a bit slower in action. The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland which causes release of ACTH hormone, this hormone then causes the release of cortisol which is known as the stress hormone. The autonomous nervous system on the other hand works more rapidly and it causes the adrenal medulla to release adrenaline and noradrenaline and other stress hormones.(Goldstein 2010) These hormones are both useful in the state of stress for an organism. The 2 hormones increase heart rate and breathing, this is also to help with running or escaping the threat. Other physical changes happen as a result of this,pupils are dilated, rectum is contracted, there is also more blood flow to areas of the body which would be in more need such as the brain and less blood to places such as the digestive system. <nl><nl>Give an example and brief explanation of three neurodevelopmental disorders: one caused mainly by genetic factors, one mainly caused by environmental factors and one that demonstrates gene-environment interactions.<nl> Down Syndrome is mainly caused by genetic factors. Those with down syndrome normally suffer from learning difficulties. This disorder happens as a result of there being 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of just 2. A disorder mainly caused by environmental factors is  foetal alcohol syndrome, this is characterised by physical and also mental disability which is caused by brain damage to the fetus as a result of the mother\u2019s alcohol uptake during the pregnancy. The severity depends on how much the mother was drinking and the severity of it.(Paediatr Child Health. 2002). ASD- autism spectrum disorder is a disorder which demonstrates gene-environment interaction.<nl>Outline the main structural components of the human brain, and describe 3 different examples of localisation of function within the brain.<nl><nl>6.The main structural components of the human brain are the cerebellum, cerebrum and brainstem. One example of localisation is study on Phineas Gage was involved in a traumatic accident which resulted in him losing a large part of his left frontal lobe, after his insicident his personality and mood changed massively.(LF HAAS, 2001)The left frontal lobe is associated with mood regulation and social behaviour which explained the change in phineas gage.Another example is the motor cortex, this part is associated with performing voluntary movements, damage to this area is likely to end in someone struggling to perform complicated tasks in terms of movement. One of the most famous examples for localisation of brain function is the study by Carl Wernicke.Wernicke\u2019s aphasia is the damaged left temporal lobe, this part of the brain is associated with language, this results in the inability to produce speech that makes sense, the speech is fluent however it doesn't make any sense and there is a lack of comprehension.(Binder, 2015)", "positive": "r SirMadam,<nl><nl>On the <DDth> <month> I lost my student card and as a result of external financial circumstances I was unable to buy a new one as I had already a previous one.

{"anchor": "<question1><nl>Autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD) is a polygenic-neurodevelopmental-disorder characterised by three subsets of-deficits: social-impairments, communication impairments-and-repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a-minimum-of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American-Psychiatric-Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). The big 3 theories that attempt to explain the ASD profile are Theory of Mind (TOM), Executive Function Theory (EFT) and Weak Central Coherence (WCC), they are higher level theories as they focus on developmental differences in cognition rather than at a perceptual level. <nl>TOM looks at the ability to attribute mental-states to others as-well as yourself. A deficit of this ability in the ASD population is widely notarised in research tasks such as the Sally Ann and the Unexpected Contents tasks which was passed by around 20% of ASD-individuals compared to 86-96% in a neurotypical population (Baron-Cohen-et-al, 1985;Perner-et-al, 1989). Evidence of  differences regarding TOM are also found in neuro-studies measuring brain activity, a study conducted by White et al, (2014) found ASD children showed similar atypical neuro-activity as non-ASD children with historical mentalizing-deficits. TOM is strong at explaining social impairments such as lack of shared enjoyment, socio-emotional reciprocity and also some communication-issues such as not picking up subtle cues in conversation (Kimhi, 2014). Overall, TOM suffers from two main limitations, even with differences in brain activity of core-TOM regions, it cannot explain social deficits completely as 20% still pass those tests mentioned and secondly, it fails to account one third of the ASD diagnostic triad: repetitive activities.<nl>On the other hand, EFT-is-concerned with-our-minds-attentional system, spatially located in the brains frontal lobes. It-is-based-specifically-on-the ability of novel idea generation, response inhibition, planning and cognitive flexibility (Diamond, 2012). The EFT attempts to explain ASD deficits both social and non-social, successfully in tasks such as the Wisconsin-Card-Sorting-Test, where cognitive flexibility-is-required-to-follow-different card-rules-linearly and ASD-individuals show lack of flexibility and high amounts of  perseverative errors in set shifting, instead adhering to repetition of the old rule . A meta-analysis by Landry &amp; Al-Taie (2016) covering this topic spanned 30 years and found effect sizes of 0.30-0.74; all studies statistically significant. Furthermore, EFT attempts to explain other ASD behaviours such as lack of inhibition of prepotent-response which executive-functioning manages (Levy, 2007). Although this has mixed evidence, a study by Adams &amp; Jarrold (2012) showed ASD individuals have a deficit in distractor-inhibition related to perceptual processing rather than the prepotent response due to executive functioning.<nl>Last of the big 3, WCC, is explained in an updated model by Happe &amp; Frith (2006), describing ASD as an imbalance in data integration and a bias toward local elements over global rather than a deficit. This difference in processing style is strong at explaining issues with emotion recognition in faces, Lahaie et al (2006), found those with ASD could be primed toward arbitrary segments of the face as much as toward intuitive parts like the mouthnose. This bias-towards local elements is supported by Gross (2004) who-reported ASD individuals showing atypical patterns due to focusing on the lower regions of the face instead of the whole, this explains well issues of emotion recognition due to failure to process the whole face. The WCC\u2019s ability to explain restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) has also found support by Chen et al (2008) who found RRB associations with a detailed-focused processing style. Lastly, the WCC helps understanding the benefits having ASD-provides which neither of the other theories presented, such as better performance on embedded figures and block design tasks due to them requiring you to look for local elements that make-up the global (Shah-&amp;-Frith, 1983;1993).<nl>Conclusively, this short essay has attempted to weigh the ability of the big-3 theories in explaining the full clinical profile of ASD, the research shows none are able to. Either having mixed evidence in some areas or failing to account aspects of the profile entirely and even suffering from domain specificity, research found false-belief deficits in TOM only affected ASD individuals when the task was completed mentally vs. visual checks of physical differences (Perner &amp; Leekam, 2008). However, over time they can be developed further like the Empathising and Systemizing theory which attempts to build on TOM and explain non-social aspects (Baron-Cohen, 2009). Most importantly,-there is a positive to theories being independent to a restrictive global picture, ASD is multi-faceted and forcing a single picture is-unlikely to be representative-of everyone. Instead, is the idea of-fractionation, it shows the likelier picture of different theories being able to explain the-different domains-of the same impairments and the whole clinical profile being accounted for (Brunsdon-&amp;-Happe, 2013).<nl><nl><question2><nl>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by 3 subsets of deficits: social impairments, communication impairments and repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a minimum of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). Lower-level processes such as percept of sensory modalities which are extremely important in those with ASD. Many aspects can be explained by the theory of Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) and it itself is an alternative to the WCC, the EPF focusses on difference in perceptual processing vs. WCC which focuses entirely on higher level cognitive processing instead. <nl>The EPF has a very broad range of research covering research on many different atypical behaviours in ASD, one being enhanced abilities in embedded figures, block-design and visual search tasks (Mottron &amp; Burack , 2001). These findings have mixed backings in research, it is supported by research on inhibition of prepotent responses which found Perceptual distractors were more inhibiting than prepotent responses (Adams &amp; Jarrold, 2011). Conversely, disputing evidence by Kaldy et al (2016) agreed with the idea that ASD individuals are better at these tasks but argue that it is instead due to deficitsdifferences in attentional networks. Explained due to behaviours in ASD such as overfocusing due to fixationpreoccupation in tasks and-restricted-interests which enable individuals to perform better in detail focused tasks. Nevertheless, the idea of enhanced percept is highly important in explaining savant skills as an example, where access to raw, less-processed information is manipulated for the benefit of ASD individuals, the EPF states savant skills deeply rooted by perceptual elements e.g. in drawingmusic (Motron et al, 2009). This co-aligns well with the fact that around 95% of ASD individuals experience sensory symptoms due to a perceptual differences both positive and negative (Tomchek &amp; Dunn, 2007), but explanations for hyposensitivity are still awry.<nl>Another explanation of atypical ASD behaviour is the social motivation theory by Chevallier (2012), it attempts to explain social deficits, specifically why there are social impairments. It concluded that due to lack of social interest, ASD children miss out on key opportunities to develop social skills and are socially impaired as a result. This is supported by Fletcher-Watson (2009) who found that when given a hybrid image of both social and non-social areas, those with ASD spend equal time in both and are less likely to have their first fixation on the social area.<nl> However, there is research that argues a stark contrast, instead in the favour of perceptual load. Research on object personification in ASD, found significant amounts of loneliness and object personification and reported an ASD need to personify objects as to alleviate social disconnection and isolation (White &amp; Remington, 2018). If ASD individuals do have social interest, then why are they socially impaired? Research on face-to-face interference by Riby et al (2012), found individuals with ASD when asked to maintain hold gaze had worse task performance, these findings lead to the idea that those with ASD are perceptually overloaded in social situations like holding gaze. Cyclically back to the inference from social motivation theory, those with ASD therefore avoid social situations in order to not feel overloaded. Both theories are able to successfully reason both socialcommunicative impairments and lend the idea that in the absence of social experience, ASD individuals are caught up in preoccupated behaviour.<nl>It\u2019s clear from this that there is a lot of research on ASD on both lower and higher level processes, and both equally can explain atypical behaviours shown in ASD individuals whether it by lack of developed social skills due to perceptual capacity or be social impairments due to deficits of TOMEFT. The fact remains that none of these theories can explain with unyielding evidence the full clinical profile of ASD and every atypical behaviours described (Mottron et al, 2006; Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). For example, albeit the mixed evidence, the EPF theory can successfully reason repetitive activities and some social impairments but can be outdone on the latter by TOM.  However, regardless of which is correct, having a multi-faceted evidence base is a positive, it enables us to look at all angles of ASD rather than forcing a singular theory to explain all dimensions. Furthermore, doing so has led to good outcomes, such as revised updates to theories for their shortcomings such as the updated EPF theory by Mottron et al (2006),which added in the novel idea that higher order processing can be an optional pathway for those with ASD.", "positive": "<addr6_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you so much for your help.<nl><nl><nl>Best wishes,<nl><part_FN><new>yo,<nl><nl>This is the powerpoint currently. viola!<nl><nl>-<part_IN><new>Hi <addr3_FN>,<nl><nl>I have attempted to do all the analyses the way you showed me, but I am unsure if I have done it right.

{"anchor": "Parenting Is defined by \u2018Purposive activities aimed at ensuring the survival and development of children (Hoghugi, 2004); these activities ensure the children to be effective citizens within society. Various research has contributed to our understanding of the impact of parenting within child development, concerning parent rearing styles, socioeconomic background, alongside the demands which come with parenthood.  <nl>Research into parenting styles has helped in our understanding of parenting on child development, about investigating the relationship between the type of occupation depended on social class and parenting styles. As white-collar workers require the individual to deal more with the creative ideas, symbols, and interpersonal realities, whilst blue-collar workers are required to conform to external standards such as orderliness, neatness, and obedience (Gecas &amp; Nye, 1974; Kohn, 1969). From these contrasting two occupations research suggests that this essentially has influence in child-rearing styles to the child development concerning the socialisation of the child within society, alongside with their identity and values; as those of a lower-class may emphasise obedience and respect to authority to their children in comparison to middle-upper class parents who may encourage initiative, curiosity, and creativity to their child (Greenberger, O\u2019Neil,&amp; Nagel, 1994).<nl>This research evidence can be perceived as reliable in contributing to our understanding of the indirect impact of parenting on child development, as various studies also support the notion of socioeconomic status influencing parenting and child development. This is evident as research shows that poor conditions within the workplace such as a busy day, high workload, and higher job demands are related to poor parenting behaviour (Repetti 1992, 1994). This is further supported by research by Repetti et al, (1991) which showed that fluctuations in job stressors experienced by male air traffic controllers contributed to the absence of the father, this consisted of fewer high involvement interactions and less monitoring and help with the children\u2019s schoolwork.  Simultaneously, mothers with a variety of occupational status and heavy workloads also have less involvement and more withdrawal from children.<nl>Moreover, it can also be argued that this research aids in our understanding, as it does not have a bias about the role of father as solely a breadwinner but values the importance of father and child interaction in the development of the child. This non-traditional family approach to investigating the relationship between parenting and child development increases the mundane realism of the findings with today\u2019s society with variations in family dynamics; especially with the consideration of the crucial role of the father in a child\u2019s development.<nl>Baumrind's (1967) three patterns of parenting styles Authoritarian, Permissive, and Authoritative has contributed to our understanding of the impact of parenting on child development. Glasgow et al (1997) state that \u2018Authoritarian parents are highly demanding and unresponsive\u2019; this consists of the parent attempting to control and mould the behaviour of their children according to a set standard. This parenting style has increased our understanding with the supporting evidence which shows its effect on child development. As evidence shows that children from authoritarian families more prone to levels of perfectionism, critical attitudes, and anxiety (Randall, Bohner, &amp; Travers, 2015), alongside low academic achievement.  <nl>The second parenting style is authoritative parenting this consists of maintaining an effective balance between high levels of demandingness and responsiveness, alongside being warm and supportive parents. This style is found to be the most effective parenting style concerning school achievement. As a result of encouraging bidirectional communication between both the child and parent (Glasgow et al., 1997, p.508). In addition to this, the warm and affectionate relationship between children and parents promote cognitive growth in children (Maccoby &amp; Martin, 1983; Baumrind, 1973, 1979).<nl>The final parenting style is Permissive, this consists of a \u2018more responsive than they are demanding approach\u2019, therefore leading to little or no discipline for the child. This style has contributed to the impact of this parenting on child development. This is apparent within the findings of Sahithya, et al. (2020) which illustrated that a significant association with permissive parenting style and the sociability and emotionality of the child, alongside increased anxiety levels.<nl>These parenting styles can be seen as effective with the supporting evidence in regard to it touching all the spheres of the child development such as school achievement, mental health, and the socialisation the child, in comparison to adopting a narrow approach on child development such as the child\u2019s behaviour alone.<nl>However, it can be argued that there is a cultural bias within the research of parenting styles with its influence on child development.  As cultures may perceive a parenting style as a more favourable and beneficial contribution to their child development; Authoritarian parenting in Asian cultures is perceived as more effective as they hold the belief that tough love leads to success (You &amp; Malley-Morrison 2000). Therefore, from this it can be argued that based upon various cultural viewpoints on parenting styles it will be difficult to see the impact of parenting styles within a child\u2019s development as there appears to be no distinct correct style of parenting. <nl>Finally, it can also be argued that a parent\u2019s mental health may also have influenced a child\u2019s development. This is apparent based upon the difficulties that come with parenthood, such as sleep deprivation, finical stress, strained partner relationship (Nelson et al.,2014); essentially affecting the wellbeing of the parent affects the child\u2019s development. This is further supported by Goodman et al, (2011) which found that there was an association between maternal depression and a child\u2019s negative behaviour and psychopathology.  <nl>To conclude, it is evident that there is an association between parenting and child development, with the influence on parenting styles, the socio-economic status of the parent, alongside with the well-being of the parent. From these aspects it can be concluded that various aspects of the parent\u2019s life solely have a direct and indirect effect on child development.

{"anchor": "The parties involved; Alder Hey Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust, Mr Thomas Evans, Ms Kate James and Alfie Evans. The first case, Alder Hey Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust v Evans, was in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice which considers \u2018declarations in medical treatment cases\u2019. Alfie was \u2018terminally ill with a severe and progressive neurodegenerative condition\u2019 with \u2018simply no prospect of recovery\u2019. <nl><nl>Since parties were unable to decide the terms of an end of life plan, it was decided \u2018the matter shall be listed before Hayden J\u2019. Represented by Mr Diamond, a writ of \u2018habeas corpus\u2019 was requested to \u2018release Alfie from his hospital bed\u2019 arguing he was \u2018unlawfully detained\u2019. Two submissions were argued: Alfie had the right to discharge himself and his parents were entitled to take him to Italy. Mr Mylonas argued Alfie is in hospital \u2018for the purposes of receiving care and treatment in accordance with the court\u2019s order\u2019 therefore his liberty is not deprived. This can be supported in Ferreira \u2018a person is not being deprived of their liberty where they are receiving treatment and are physically restricted by their physical infirmities\u2019. Furthermore, Hayden J stated that \u2018habeas corpus applies only to individuals unlawfully detained or whose civil liberties have been compromised in some way\u2019, therefore the application was \u2018entirely misconceived\u2019 as not applicable to Alfie. Whilst the Trust\u2019s care plan had approval from Alfie\u2019s guardian, Mr Evans objected against the plan. With a \u2018viscerally engaged army of Facebook supporters\u2019, it can be said Mr Evans wanted what he felt was right. <nl><nl>In Gard, the judge stated welfare of the child shall be the paramount consideration in any question concerning the upbringing of the child in any proceedings. This is \u2018stronger than\u2019 in all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. Although the 1989 Children\u2019s Act allows parents to make decisions about medical treatment where the child cannot consent, if the child is at risk of harm, such as in the present case, the state can intervene. <nl>The Christian Legal Centre argued \u2018by preventing further treatment of Alfie, Alder Hey and the courts are compelling Alfie to die\u2019. Treloar argued \u2018removal of parental authority as a result of referral to the High Court is wrong, and deeply unjust\u2019. Mr Pavel Stroilov provided a letter to the father, stating \u2018to come to the hospital with a team of medical professionals with their own life support equipment and move Alfie\u2019. It was concluded that the letter was misleading as false advice was given. <nl>As \u2018Alfie is now breathing independently\u2019, Mr Diamond argued on behalf of the father, \u2018the removal of the ventilator and his Italian citizenship are changes of events justifying a reconsideration\u2019. Whereas, Mr Jason Coppel on behalf of the mother, argued \u2018it is a fundamental right under EU law to access services in any other member state\u2019 therefore Alfie is obliged to free movement within the European Union. However, the judge ruled allowing him to travel is \u2018fundamentally against the core principle\u2019 of the court. Although the public are surprised that Alfie is breathing, \u2018it is not a surprise to the doctors who deal with individuals from whom treatment is withdrawn\u2019.<nl>The ratio decidendi held there was no significant change, therefore the application had no substance. Only relevant consideration were Alfie\u2019s best interests, and the impact was \u2018not a matter that the court could take into account\u2019. The habeas corpus was used as a tool to argue for the same outcome, but it does not change the fact that the \u2018parents\u2019 views were not determinative\u2019. Therefore, the permission to appeal was refused. <nl>With a global awareness of the case, Sir David Henshaw said, \u2018staff have endured a \"barrage\" of abuse\u2019. The tensions resulted into \u2018aggressive demonstrations outside the hospital, and threats of the hospital being stormed resulted in police intervention\u2019. Campaigners now support Charlie\u2019s Law and Alfie\u2019s Law, arguing parents need better rights in the law regarding medical decisions.", "positive": "<addr1_FN>, <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I hope you are well.

{"anchor": "Creativity is a characteristic of experts in solving a problem, it is an unusual and insightful solution which is of real value which involves the integration of ideas. Creative solutions must be novel and acknowledged by society. The study of creativity consists of the 4 p\u2019s which focuses either on, creative people, creative processes, products of creativity and creative places (environment).<nl>According to the psychometric approach, participants are tested using mental tests for direct measurements. However, such tests often confound intelligence and creativity, because not all creative people are high in IQ. Supporting this theory, Guilford (1956) distinguished between convergent and divergent thinking. He proposed that convergent thinkers find one best solution to a problem whereas, divergent thinkers can lead to many solutions to the same problem. He concluded that, creativity is a form of divergent thinking, because it brings many unrelated ideas together, also known as insight. Therefore, creativity makes use of methods which test divergent thinking such as the \"unusual uses test\" by J.P. Guilford (1967). Although divergent creativity tests are time consuming, they provide accurate measures of creativity than convergence.<nl>Creative Insight can occur in three ways (Sternberg and Davidson, 1982). Firstly, selective encoding refers to most important information being extracted from what is available. Secondly, selective combination is known to be the best way of combining information is perceived. Lastly, selectively comparison, whereby the information for the current problem being solved is related by analogy to a similar problem in one\u2019s past, which often uses mental images (Shepard 1978). Utilising these steps, creativity can be made easier to obtain. <nl>The biographic and autographic approach for creativity is idiosyncratic and makes major use of peer judgments. Wallas (1926) identified 4 stages in the creative process which include; preparation which refers to problem solving, incubation which is yet controversial, inspiration and verification whereby the solution is checked.", "positive": "ww Ma\u2019sha\u2019Allah \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95<new>I look so scary wth<new>But time fliessss mannn<new>Miss youuuu\ud83e\udd7a\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f<new>Omgg noo wayyyy<new>Finally man we haven\u2019t met in like a yearrrr<new>Yesss just come next week? <day> the buses are running now aswell<new>Let me know as soon as u do!<new>Yess and <pers_FN_SN> aswell comeon<new>\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<new>What month do is she going<new>Omg really end of <month> ?<new>It better b before we come back\ud83d\ude02<new>Omg ur ganna come to hers aswell<new>So u need proper clothes n accessorise<new>Yesss omg can\u2019t wait<new>Yeah they\u2019re ganna b sik days<new>I\u2019m ganna b so bored when u go", "attacked": "I look so scary, but time is passing man, and time is passing man, and time is passing man, woman duuuuu \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 <new>Omgg noo wayyyy <new>Finally we have met like a yearr <new>Yess only comes next week? <new> The buses are driving just as well now <new>Let me know as soon as we come back! <new>Yess and <pers_FN_SN>So come come come on <new> <new>In what month do they really end up driving from <new> ?new>It's better b before we come back <new>Omg ur ganna come to her as well as <new>So we need proper clothing n accessorise <new>Yesssss omg can't wait <new>It's better b before we come back to her as well <new>So we need proper clothing <new>", "attack_type": "back_translation"}
{"anchor": "Johns Case:\u2028<nl>John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010).<nl><nl>Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: <nl>John\u2019s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John\u2019s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992).<nl>Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so.<nl>John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017).<nl>As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008),  who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008).<nl><nl>John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently.\u2028<nl>John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood.<nl><nl>Coping:<nl>John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not  actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit  university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance.<nl>In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). <nl><nl>Interventions:<nl>The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and  has  little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007).<nl>Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation <nl>The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": "Hotels: Hotel Katajanokka- 160 per night, 4.5 stars. south of central helsinki Hilton Helsinki Strand- 174 per night, 4.7 stars, north of first hotel Both have restaurant, the strand has a pool aswell ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cafes: free wifi at both Savy- further north of the strand ,4.5 stars Artisan cafe, 1 road east of Savy 4.7 stars (Can go to both on separate days for a change of scene) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Helsinki city museum - Worlds only museum focussing on Helsinki -Everyday life there and details about spaces and atmosphere in Helsinki -Souvenir shop inside too aswell as a bar -Near both hotels ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Restaurants: (Reserve online available, and dine in available) Restaurant Savoy, 4.6 stars, Finnish food, in between both hotels, expensive.

{"anchor": "Rationale:<nl>The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today\u2019s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual\u2019s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual\u2019s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><nl>Discourse 1- negativity of social media<nl>Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl> <nl>Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. <nl><nl>Discourse 2- vital for families<nl>Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. <nl><nl>Discourse 3- loneliness <nl>Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely.<nl><nl>Discourse 4- social media not healthy<nl>Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved.<nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely.<nl>Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling. The wrong way to do it is by lying or exaggerating on social media just to acquire a specific response or reaction from the people reading it.", "positive": "Dear CEO, Following the task you have given me, I have arranged your itinerary for your trip to Helsinki.

{"anchor": "Deductive and Inductive reasoning are examples of propositional logic to construct thoughts into a valid argument. Deductive reasoning begins from a general statement that leads to a certain conclusion (Johnson-Laird, 2000; Rips, 1999; Williams, 2000). For example, \u2018all noble gases are stable, helium is a noble gas, so helium is stable.\u2019  Inductive reasoning begins with specific observations which lead to a conclusion that is likely to explain the observation and the conclusion may be used to predict future specific occasions (Johnson-Laird, 2000). An example would be if all children in one day care like Legos, it could be assumed all children like Legos. <nl>A similarity between the reasonings are that they are both used to provide a valid argument and are used often. Another similarity is that both reasonings follow premises in which they base their argument on.<nl>A difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is that deductive reasoning begins with a hypothesis and tests the hypothesis via an observation whilst inductive reasoning begins with observations and then moves towards a theory. This is because deductive inference is based upon theory whilst inductive inference is based on observations. There is also a difference in validity between the reasonings as deductive reasoning is more precise as if all the premises are true then the conclusion is true for example, \u2018if all dolphins are mammals and all mammals have kidneys, all dolphins therefore have kidneys.\u2019 However, even if the premises are true in induction, the conclusion is still not definitely true. For example, \u2018if the first button I get out of a bag is a red button, the third button I obtain from the bag is red, therefore it is inductive logic to conclude all the buttons in a bag are red.\u2019 Therefore, deduction is more accurate and quantitative whilst induction is more general and qualitative. Due to this, induction is used more in everyday life as it is harder to obtain a sequential set of facts that are known to be true in deduction.", "positive": "h let\u2019s do <location>!! u been before?<new>ugh yeah :((<new>i defo won\u2019t get the burger again<new>i always get it thinking each time it will taste better<new>but it doesn\u2019t<new>yeah i went a few weeks back it\u2019s so so nice<new>loads of stores and food options so if we like it this time we\u2019ll go again<new>at least it\u2019s bigger than <location> too<new>yeah i love burgers generally tho so it\u2019s annoying :((<new>yeah it\u2019s so pretty i\u2019ll bring my disposable camera<new>you should bring your film camera too<new>yeah <location> is pretty small compared to it", "attacked": "h lets do <location>! u before? <new>ugh yeah :((<new>i defo wont) get the Burger again <new>i get it thinking every time it will chance better <new>but it doesnnew>yeah i goed a few weeks back its so so nice <new>loads of stores and food options so if we like it sight it sight this time we're going back <new>at least it's bigger than <new>yeah i love burgers in general tho so it's annoying :((((<new>yeah it's so beautiful i ll bring my disposable camera <new>you should also <new>yeah <location> is pretty small compared to it", "attack_type": "back_translation"}

{"anchor": "This strategy paper will focus on suggesting realistic solutions to the problem of educational gender inequality in India. This inequality is a clear problem; unequal access to education is an infringement of human rights. If this gender disparity was lessened, the well-being and development of children would be positively impacted, as well as the economy of the country itself (Fuller, 2019). To tackle this issue, proposed strategies could take the form of implementing new legislative reforms that aid families in the struggles they face, as well as reforming teaching throughout India in order to help eradicate damaging cultural and social norms. The paper will begin by firstly explaining the main problems within the education sector in India and will then highlight the importance of achieving gender equality in education. The main body of the paper will entail a detailed analysis of the current strategies and legislation in place as well as non-governmental reforms made by different organisations. The paper will then move towards a focus on the suggested strategies that could be incorporated into the current education system to alleviate gender inequalities and will be compared to the successes of educational reform in Sweden. This will include a description of the targets for the reforms, instruments to aid reform, and the target groups at which reforms are aimed at. The paper will conclude with a summary of the findings from this research and ways to ensure the successful implementation of new strategies.  <nl>Why is this a problem?<nl>There are two primary factors that can limit the education of girls in India: cultural traditions and poverty. In terms of cultural traditions, there are several reasons that this issue can play a significant role in the educational disparity between genders. Firstly, the miseducation of parents about the importance of schools for girls and the costings of education itself thus leads to families becoming reluctant to educate girls within the household. Research shows that parents are more willing to send their girls to school if they had access to more information about school (Maertens, 2011). Furthermore, it is said that gender discrimination within household expenditure and education has resulted in the inadequate progress of educating of women in many countries across the world, and thus ingrains this issue into the societal framework of such countries (Saha, 2013). This is also reinforced by the low literacy rates in India. The correlation between low literacy rates among men and women indicates that the miseducation of parents can affect the education of girls because they themselves have had inadequate education, and it is difficult for them to understand the importance of it, further highlighting the gender inequalities between men and women through previous social norms. For example, the 2011 literacy rates of women were 57.93% compared to men which were 77.15% (Pathania, 2020) demonstrating gender disparities and how poverty can be a factor in gender inequalities within education. Poverty plays an important role in the lack of education for girls. Daughters from families that face social pressures to get married are more likely to only complete minimum education, as shown in a study of three rural villages in India, where only 39% of girls were allowed by their parents to pursue higher education, compared to the 71% of boys who would go into further education (Maertens, 2013). Furthermore, educating women is not prioritised in the household as it stops the income that would otherwise be earned from girls going straight into work rather than staying in school. Therefore, working and earning can be seen to be put on a pedestal instead for the many families facing financial difficulties (Hebert, 2020).<nl>Why is this an important issue for gender equality?<nl>As UNICEF has stated, the educational advancement of girls is the most effective way of combatting challenges to human development, so it is important to expand educational access and overcome cultural norms to achieve this (Ross, Shah &amp; Wang, 2011). Inequalities within education are important to the issue of gender equality, as even though India emerges as one of the top three countries for higher education (Bazaz &amp; Akram, 2020), in certain states such as Uttar Pradesh, only 33.20% of women are educated compared to the 73.40% of men who are educated, highlighting that there are severe problems within the education system that disadvantage women. Furthermore, this can lead to other problems such as a gender gap in the labour market, as if employers value a woman\u2019s education less than that of a man\u2019s, and therefore there are fewer economic incentives to educate women, which subsequently affects the economy and the wellbeing of women (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Another factor that makes this issue important is that the education of girls further reduces the risks they face, such as abuse and child marriage, as currently, a third of child brides worldwide are in India (Sahni, 2018). Moreover, better education for girls reduces the risks of child labour in poorer families to ensure the survival of their households, as the hourly wages of a child with higher school education are 8.97% higher compared to a child with no schooling, leading to less exploitation (Chamarbagwala, 2008). <nl>Attempted strategies to achieve gender equality in education<nl>There have been many attempts in India to close the gender gaps in education, through both legal and social means. The main legislative reform introduced was the Right to Education Act in 2009, in which, all children between 6 and 14 years of age are required to complete primary school education. This reform has proven successful as enrolment between 2013-14 increased from 43.8% to 48.2% (Sahni, 2018). However, its success still proves limited on the gender equality front as a UNESCO report detailed that of the 95% of children who attended primary school, only 40% continued onto secondary education, in which, a small fraction of the 40% were girls (Modi, 2017). Attempts have also been made to reform the curriculum. However, this failed due to the response of disadvantaged schools towards the issue of gender equality: an attempt was made to create a new system where boys of different abilities were paired with girls, but this meant the educational interests of girls were sacrificed, therefore showing little to no development in changing gender inequalities in schools (Charlton, 2007).<nl>Secondly, a non-legislative reform that was made to combat gender inequality in education was the KGBV programme introduced in 2004. The goal of the programme was to increase children\u2019s, and in particular girls, access to the curriculum and to improve teaching standards. This began successfully as two Indian states partnered with CARE India (a non-governmental organisation) to introduce KGBV schools that were single-sex and employ a non-traditional curriculum. The KGBV school initiative was shown to be successful as they were more inclusive than state schools, as children of all castes could attend, which also allowed the new schools challenged harmful social norms. However, the success was limited as the KGBV programme did not focus on education above seventh grade where school dropout rates for girls are the highest (Shah, 2015).<nl>Finally, the most successful attempt at improving gender inequality in education was by ANK, a non-profit organisation with an aim to empower girls. ANK set up in 10 rural villages and introduced several initiatives for girls including: bicycle banks in 2002 to improve access to schools for girls, a life skills education programme out of school hours, a scholarship programme, and a karate programme. The implementation of these programmes showed great promise as 1,100 girls achieved a scholarship and 1,000 girls were given access to bikes. It was found that the combination of the bicycle bank and the life skills education programme led to the best education outcomes for girls. However, the bicycle bank programme was discontinued and this programme only reached a small number of girls, so, nationally, gender disparities remained high (Modi, 2017).<nl>Proposed Strategies<nl>My first proposed strategy is to subsidise costs for school by 50% for low-income families; as mentioned above, many parents selectively choose their male children to attend school rather than their female children, because of financial difficulties. Therefore, subsidising the costs of schooling can enable equal opportunities for girls. This has proved successful in countries such as Sweden, where pre-schooling costs have been subsidised for lower-income families, in order to equalise opportunities for all and ensure substantial educational attainment for both males and females (Bjorklund, Clark, Edin, Fredricksson &amp; Krueger, 2006). Success can be seen clearly when compared to India, a large 79% of the students go on to secondary school in Sweden (European Commission, 2017) against a mere 40% in India, in which, the ratio of boys to girls is equal in Sweden unlike in India (Modi, 2017).<nl>Additionally, another legislative reform that could be introduced is to improve families\u2019 access to daycare and after school care, so that parents can work, alleviating any stresses on children providing additional household income. A similar policy proved successful in Sweden (Sweden, 2020), in which a right to daycare was introduced in the 1990s for working parents to alleviate financial pressure (Fritzell, Hvinden, Kautto, Kvist &amp; Uusitalo, 2001). Furthermore, there has been evidence to suggest that altering the way teachers are trained helps to promote gender equality and eradicate bias in the classroom. In a proposed system called REFLECT, teachers are given criteria that they must meet, including creating a suitable learning environment for female and male children - this could prove beneficial in India (Kollmayer, 2020).<nl>The next proposed strategy is an extension of the work of ANK with the bicycle banks and life skills education programme (Modi, 2017) as it proved successful but stopped due to a lack of funding. This would enable a focus on the education of girls and give them access to adequate teaching, which in turn reaps enormous benefits economically, socially, and mentally, especially in terms of the wellbeing of girls in India. It would also help to elevate the goal of India to become more gender-inclusive, as currently, their progress for gender equality remains slow and they stand at a ranking of 132 out of 187 countries (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Sequentially, to enable parents of girls to realise the importance of education, it is vital to recruit them as allies in the movement against gender inequalities in education. To do this, parents\u2019 evenings could be introduced for teachers to educate parents in schooling and other matters that put girls at risk such as child marriage. Research shows that parents evenings are important in the development of a child and important for the parents themselves as they are responsible for making key decisions that impact the future of their children (Fefer, 2020), highlighting how this can also be a way to communicate the positive prospects for girls with the aid of education. <nl>To conclude, it is prevalent that actions must be taken within education legislation and within the households of girls to combat the problem of gender inequality within education. The government must take steps to support families of lower incomes so as to ensure no one is denied equal opportunity to education. This will reduce child labour rates, increase literacy rates, and improve India\u2019s ranking on the gender equality index, as well as increasing the economic status of many civilians in India. With the increased education of girls, it will help to combat harmful social norms in the future, preventing young girls from the fate of child marriage, abuse, and exploitation. With reforms in teaching, they could allow for long-lasting changes within education, as it means they can be the main drivers for change within schools. This, combined with the added aid of regular parents\u2019 evenings, allows for teachers to become catalysts in changing negative social attitudes towards gender equality concerns that strategies like these will remain only partially effective. For example, India was one of 52 countries that refused to comply with Article 5 of the UN sustainable development goals which states that \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" (United Nations, 2020). Without the support of the government, gender equality may not be valued. However, this can be counteracted by the implementation and enforcement of new laws, starting within the education sector, to allow women and young girls to become more independent and assert themselves within society.", "positive": "h everyone was fine!!!

{"anchor": "In this essay, I will mention the key features of the psychodynamic approach, such as Freud and the unconscious mental processes, and those of the biological approach \u2013 genetics, heredity and evolution. Core assumptions, such as the role of nature and nurture in the key features, will also be remarked upon and compared. This essay will allude to how these perspectives are different, their stands on the nature-nurture debate, and how they are similar \u2013 such as the influence of childhood.<nl><nl>The key features of the psychodynamic approach are mostly synonymous to Sigmund Freud, and his research with unconscious mental processes. This approach focuses on the influence of the \u2018unconscious\u2019 and how our behaviour as adults is rooted from childhood experiences (Jarvis, 2000). Freud derived theories about the mind and personalities, coming up with theory about the conscious, preconscious and unconscious, how Freudian slips showed what you are truly thinking but trying to hide, and the It (Id), I (Ego), and above-I (superego) (Freud, 1993 as cited in Jarvis, 2000). This means that this approach looks at how past experiences are reflected in current behaviour.<nl><nl>Like the psychodynamic approach, the biological approach has a researcher well known to the field \u2013 Charles Darwin. The key features of this approach focus on the role of genetics and evolution. Evolution refers to the way genes in our DNA can change over generations due to the role of \u2018natural selection\u2019. Twin studies have been helpful in researchers understanding to the extent genes play a role in behaviour and how much the environment may play a role in this also. For example, twin and adoption studies show how the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher if you are genetically similar than dissimilar (environment also plays a role as concordance is not 100%) - Cardno &amp; Gottesman (2000). This means that this approach focuses on the interaction of genes and the environment - how nature can influence nurture and nurture can influence nature.<nl><nl>A difference between these approaches, is the way that these perspectives view the influence of nature and nurture. The psychodynamic approach concentrates on the role of the unconscious and childhood experiences being the influence on adult behaviour. Therefore, psychoanalysts, such as Freud,, emphasise the role of nurture over nature. In contrast, the biological approach concentrates on the way nature and nurture have a similar influence on each other \u2013 the role of genetics as well as environmental influences. <nl><nl>Another similarity with the approaches is that they both have socially sensitive research that have impacted on people negatively. According to Jarvis (2000), in the 1950s and 1960s, psychiatrists following psychodynamic concepts blamed autism on poor parenting. Tavris and Wade (1997) [as cited in Jarvis (2000)] described a case study that illustrated the negatives of taking a purely psychodynamic approach. This approach is reductionist. Its theories are derived from case studies such as Anna O and the work or Tavris and Wade and it tries to explain everything in accordance to psychodynamic theories. Reductionist approaches included socially sensitive research which as a result significantly harmed people \u2013 like the eugenics movement.<nl><nl>The work of Galton, fixated on the role of genetics, influencing the eugenics movement. His focus on certain traits being better in society and the fixation that these traits are hereditary only led to the research being abused and hurting thousands of people (Fairholm, 2011). Eugenics was very popular to begin with but eventually it led to a way to discriminate, segregate and sterilise (,and in Nazi Germany, systematically murder) millions of people deemed to have undesirable genes. This dark side of psychology was reductionist and ethically immoral. The eugenics movement attempted to use just genes to explain everything about people. As a result, by focusing only on genes and inheritance, the importance of the environment was ignored (Fairholm, 2011). <nl><nl>Neurodevelopmental disorders show that genes are not the only factor to developing a disorder, for example, while Fragile X Syndrome is a purely genetic disorder, Down Syndrome and Williams Syndrome are not hereditary (passed from parents to offspring) even though its genetic, and Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is purely environmental \u2013 no genetic origin. (Witton, C., 2019). This means that separating genes and the environment is not appropriate as neurodevelopmental disorders here show that nature has influence over nurture (Fragile X Syndrome) and nurture has influence over nature (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome).<nl><nl>The understanding developed from biological theories and discoveries has aided in pharmacological treatment for psychological disorders and the potential understanding on how these disorders develop. The discovery of neurones (by von Waldeyer-Hartz) and eventual discovery of the Synapse (by Sir Charles Sherrington) led to the unearthing of neurotransmitters and their functions \u2013 and their influence on the brain and psychological disorders such as serotonin with depression. This has led to biopsychology to be considered scientific due to objective and controlled research.<nl><nl>Similar to this, Freudian theory on ego defences such as displacement, denial and projection are considered today in psychodynamic therapy. These are considered in therapy as psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals, see psychological problems as rooted in childhood and dealing with the root cause, and gaining insight into trauma, can help relieve symptoms. An example of this used in the past would be the case study of Anna O \u2013 bringing trauma into the consciousness by talking about it resolved the symptoms of her hysteria. However, this approach includes vague untestable concepts that lack specifics required to assist in Psychology being considered a science. For example, the Oedipus Complex is almost impossible to measure and the use of case studies, such as Anna O reduces the validity of this approach and it being scientific as participants are not typical of the population. (Jarvis, 2000)<nl><nl>Anna O is a case study in the psychodynamic approach which focused on how the mind served to adapt the individual to the environment. The mind presents hysteria to unresolved trauma, the mind adapting the individual to its environment and past experiences. Based on this, I suggest that psychodynamic approach has functionalist perspectives. However, with Freud\u2019s insistence of interpreting and analysing dreams, this approach has certain structuralist qualities. The psychodynamic philosophy analyses the mind based on behaviour that presents itself, such as Freudian slips and dreams, which is partially what structuralism is based upon. Therefore, the psychodynamic approach is an interaction of functionalism and structuralism with a lean towards functionalism.<nl><nl>Similarly, the biological approach can be viewed to be an interaction of structuralism and functionalism. The approach analyses the mind and localises areas for specific jobs, such as with genetics and chromosome x or y on the last pair which determines gender or Broca\u2019s area for speech aphasia. This is structuralist. Where this approach links with functionalism is through evolution. Where the mind has adapted an individual to their environment. This is evident with evolutionary fears \u2013 such as fear of heights, the dark and snakes. This behaviour increased survival in the past. Another example of this is the cuteness of babies. This is also a survival factor as infants are unable to look after themselves. As a result, this \u2018cuteness\u2019 factor elicits a caregiving response and the need to look after infants and protect them from the dangers. (Kringelbach, Stark, Alexander, Bornstein &amp; Stein, 2016).<nl><nl>A similarity between the biological and psychodynamic approach are that both are deterministic approaches rather than demonstrating free will in their theories. While the biological approach approaches the nature and nurture debate as it being an interaction between the two, it is largely a deterministic approach rather than free will. Biological determinism is where biological concepts or processes determine our thoughts and behaviours (Fairholm, 2011). This approach rejects a total genetic viewpoint, especially because of the eugenics movements, but elements of this approach is still deterministic. An example would be the argument for the MAOA gene and aggression. Some have argued in the past that because one may have this gene and commit and act of aggression, this excuses their behaviour. However, this cannot be accepted in the current Criminal Justice system and that people must take responsibility for their actions as other people with this gene can control their aggression (Holmgren &amp; Winterdyk, 2011). This example shows that the biological approach focuses on deterministic theories rather than free will.<nl><nl>Moreover, the psychodynamic approach leans more on determinism than free will. This is evident in the fact that Freudian concepts argue that behaviour in the current is influenced by past experiences in childhood. This leaves little room for free will as a result. Another example is through the ego defences suggested by Freud. These are considered an automatic phenomenon to protect a person from their trauma, for example repression of trauma or displacing anger from the object of their anger to someone more vulnerable \u2013 the person isn\u2019t aware they are doing this consciously. Therefore, this removes the aspect of free will.<nl><nl>At first glance, one would assume that the biological approach and the psychodynamic approach are different, that because one focuses on genetics and evolution and the other focuses on early childhood experiences and the unconscious, that there are no similarities. However, this essay shows that, aside from the basic key features, the perspectives are more similar than first assumed. They have people that are well known to their areas \u2013 Freud and Darwin. Furthermore, both indicate that childhood has influence over behaviour \u2013 the unconscious desire and fears presented in Freudian theory and environmental influences on typical body development (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). There are differences in the perspectives, such as the psychanalytical approach considering nurture to have more influence but the biological  approach considering the interaction of nature and nurture having equal amount of effect on behaviour. In conclusion, the biological and psychodynamic are much more similar than what would first be assumed.", "positive": "nk you very much<nl><nl><part_FN_IN_SN><nl><student_number><nl><course>, 1st Year<new>Hi <pers_NN_SN> might have just recently got in contact with you about <society> and a missing candidate thingy.<nl><nl>Student number: <student_number><nl><nl>Attached should be the following:<nl>A picture of myself for people to identify me<nl>A word document of my manifesto leaflet and a screenshot<nl>A word document of my manifesto in writing for the candidate page<nl><nl>I hope that this is all you need.<nl><nl>Many thanks<nl><nl><part_FN_IN_SN><nl><student_number><nl><course>, 1st Year<nl><course> Student Rep<new>Hello <addr18_FN_SN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I have a textbook that I am trying to find access to.

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>After winning a costa first novel award, The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer (2013) became a piece of popular fiction, inviting a broad range of readers. However, it\u2019s brutal depiction of mental illness means there are differing responses to the text. \u2018Reader response data\u2019 has become a popular way for researchers to identify how a reader places themselves in relation to a text through assessing their responses to said text. <nl>This study will assess how reviews from the open access website \u2018Good Reads\u2019 align themselves to The Shock of the Fall\u2019s protagonist and overall narrative. Oatley\u2019s (1999) theory of \"identification\" or \"observer\" will be drawn upon for this purpose, as well as Stockwell\u2019s (2009) discussion of reading metaphors, so that commonalities can emerge to determine factors that cause alignment with the text. To compliment these theories, language analysis more generally will be utilised in order to collectively lead to an understanding of reader positioning within the data sets.<nl><nl>Literature Review<nl>The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer is a piece of experimental fiction portraying the deteriorating mind of the protagonist, Matthew. McCarthy-Jones (2018) praises Filer for his \"beautiful\" form and word choice, whilst Armstrong (2014, 173) highlights the brilliant use of \"complex narrative structure\" and experimental use of \"graphics and fonts\". Moreover, Armstrong argues that the novel is brilliant both in its insightful portrayal of the family bond, but also in its depictions of mental health. Similarly, Rajasingam (2014) believes the novel depicts the inpatient experience with such accuracy that it could be beneficial for junior doctors to understand the bleak realities of these unique situations. This accurate depiction is most likely down to Filer\u2019s personal experience as a psychiatric nurse (Sanai 2014), as he was seemingly able to amalgamate his previous experience to create the protagonist, Matthew.<nl>This study utilises reader response data. Reader response data is seen as a \"rigorous and evidence based\" approach to understanding reader interactions with a text (Whiteley and Canning 2017). Fish (1970) discusses how a text comes into being through reader interaction. Therefore, reader response data allows us to seek, understand and interpret reader\u2019s interactions with certain texts through different means, which is why it is utilised within this research to determine factors of alignment within reader reviews. <nl>The basis of this research surrounds Oatley\u2019s (1995;1999) theory discussing alignment with a text. Oatley (1999) argues there are two positions a reader adopts; \"identification\" or \"observer\". He believes that the observer is a spectator role, in which we are an objective outsider in a narrative, whereas identification occurs when a reader aligns themselves with the protagonist, taking on their goals and emotions. Moreover, he argues that a first-person narrative favours identification, whereas third-person narratives favour the spectatorobserver role. Identification is therefore seen as an intense alignment with the protagonist, with Oatley stating we \"become that person\" in the narrative (Oatley 1999, 446), made ever more present if the reader can sympathise with the protagonist through personal experience (Oatley 1995). However, it is important to note that these alignments are part of a scale where readers have autonomy, as opposed to having a fixed state in one position.  <nl>To analyse the position of identification or observer, one of the methods I will be using is metaphor analysis. Lakoff and Johnson\u2019s (1980) \u2018conceptual metaphor theory\u2019 highlights how we better understand an entity when it is described in relation to another. It shows how metaphors can be \"extended\", allowing us to map the meaning within a metaphor in order to gauge the full detail of the comparison. Dirven et al (2003) highlight the significance of the theory, arguing conceptual metaphor theory ignited the importance of metaphor for our understanding of knowledge. Metaphors are useful in conjunction with noticing the identifierobserver role, as the way a reader discusses their experience of reading is often linked to their level of submersion and alignment with the protagonist and the text. <nl>Stockwell (2009) and Gerrig (1993) discuss metaphors more centred around reading. Stockwell (extending knowledge outlined by Gerrig) discusses metaphors that can be used by readers to describe their reading experience. These include \"reading is a journey\", \"reading as transport\" and \"reading as control\" (Stockwell 2009, 80-81). Stockwell (2005, 144) believes critical theorists should \"engage with the texture of the text\", which allows us to read as one does when they are simply reading for enjoyment; a \"natural reader\". With \u2018Good Reads\u2019 being a platform for mostly natural readers, we can see how utilising this method will allow inferences for reader position to emerge, as the reviewers discuss their experiences in a natural way, therefore giving their natural alignment with the text. <nl>I will also be drawing on conceptions of \u2018stake inoculation\u2019 and \u2018category entitlement\u2019 within my analysis. Stake inoculation can be identified when a reader is not presenting a vested interest in a text, and has been described as readers wanting to be \"regarded as considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306). Category entitlement, however, is defined as when certain people in specific situations are given authority for their knowledge in a specific area (Potter 1996). These features can be linked to the need to keep a \"positive face\" that is protected and maintained with the social space (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967). Reviewers may use stake inoculation andor category entitlement in order to portray themselves in a positive light for other reviewers, especially because the site is seen as a \"social network for book reviews\" (Fay 2012). <nl><nl>Methodology<nl>I began my naturalistic study by sourcing reviews from the open access website \u2018Good Reads\u2019; a book reviewing website. This website was useful as it allows users to interact with reviews through \u2018likes\u2019, as well as having a rating system (one to five stars) to review the book discussed. As a result, I was able to find the most \u2018liked\u2019 reviews within each rating category. By choosing the most \u2018liked\u2019 reviews, the assumption can be made that the views described within the review reflect the majority, as they were the most widely interacted with. <nl>After selecting the most liked review from each rating category, I anonymised each review, by naming them R1 (being the review with a one-star rating) to R5 (being the review with a five-star rating), ensuring no ethical issues in relation to confidentiality could occur (See Appendix for full reviews). I then used \u2018NVivo\u2019; a form of qualitative data analysis software, to begin my analysis. I \u2018coded\u2019 each review in NVivo, which then highlighted areas where there were common themes among each review. This allowed me to make inferences as to the common themes that link to identificationobservation (Oatley 1999) within each of the rating categories. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>Comparing uses of Category Entitlement:<nl>One of the most common themes across all of the reviews is category entitlement. All of the reviewers, in one way or another, highlighted their authority within their review. The interesting part about comparing the uses of category entitlement is the difference in tone that occurs depending on how positive or negative the review is. The more negative reviews use this device in order to depict how The Shock of The Fall was a bad novel, because they identified better with certain other novels (R1 and R2). Whereas, the more positive reviews show their identification with The Shock of The Fall by providing examples of other mental health literature that has also made them feel this way (R3, R4 and R5). For example, R5 states they have read \"a number of books regarding mental illness\", but describes this text as \"purely unique\". On the other hand, R1 argues \"I would never recommend this book considering the wealth of options available to readers [\u2026]\". Peplow et al (2015, 75) discuss how you can put yourself forward as having \"expert knowledge\", which can be seen through the intentional discussion of broader knowledge. However, they also discuss how readers can \"play down\" their entitlement, which is also present through the subtle portrayals of wider reading as opposed to more direct mentions of expert knowledge (Peplow et al 2015, 74). As \u2018Good Reads\u2019 is a platform that invites avid readers, one could argue that a participant of the site would likely house a level of category entitlement simply due to this fact, and therefore their broad knowledge of literature would most likely be conveyed within their reviews, intentionally or not. Moreover, the fact that the website has open access means some reviewers may want to portray, and maintain, a \u2018positive face\u2019 (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967), which can be achieved through the use of category entitlement. Therefore, the comparative aspect category entitlement allows the users to present their identificationobservation with the text.<nl>Although in another breadth of mental illness, a study into the effects of reading novels about eating disorders showed participants felt their mood and self-confidence diminished, whilst other genres improved their mood (Troscianko 2018). Despite being about a very different aspect of mental health, I believe these findings highlight how the genre one chooses to focus on can have such ingrained effects on themselves as a reader. In a similar way to Oatley\u2019s (1995) statement about how a reader identifies more intensely if they can empathise with a reader from their personal experience, you could argue that reading fiction of this genre highlights how different forms of mental health literature ignite different reactions for certain individuals. Where the more positive reviews name novels that depict mental health in a way that has \"fascinated\" them (R4) and highlight their appreciation for such literature (R5, R3), the more negative reviews could arguably be having a similar reaction to that laid out in the study mentioned (Troscianko 2018) through their preference of other mental health literature (R2), therefore showing the use of comparison to determine alignment with the text. As the readers all portray themselves to have a broad knowledge of literature, we can see how a novel of such unique nature could create conflicting responses depending on the reviewers individual understanding and perceptions of mental health literature more generally. Therefore, we can see that all of the reviews utilise category entitlement as a device to compare The Shock of the Fall to other texts of a similar vein, which therefore portrays their level of observationidentification depending on how they \u2018rank\u2019 this text compared to others they discuss. <nl>Emotive vs Clinical Language \u2013 Comparing uses of Reading Metaphors and Stake Inoculation:<nl>Reading metaphors (Stockwell 2009; Gerrig 1993) are an insightful way to decipher the identificationobserver positioning. Stockwell (2009,80) identifies a number of metaphors commonly used by readers; reading is \"transport\", reading is \"control\", and reading is \"investment\". As these responses can be aligned more directly with an investment with the reading material, it isn\u2019t entirely unsurprising that the two top rated reviews are the only reviews which give examples of this use of metaphor. The more positive reviews actively present themselves as having an identification stance through their use of reading metaphors. R5 described being \"grabbed\" and \"held\" by the book, providing an example of the \"reading as control\" metaphor that Stockwell (2009, 80) discusses. As this is the most highly rated review, which speaks very positively about the novel as a whole, is it not surprising that the reader feels so invested in the narrative. However, despite R4 being mostly positive, the metaphors used within their review do not reflect their identification in the same way. R4 utilises \"reading as transport\" (Stockwell 2009, 80) through feelings of being lost in the narrative; \"at times you have to try and remember where you are\", as well as describing the narrative as \"following\" the narrator. Here, the use of metaphor seems to have less intensity; they are not being controlled in the same sense that R5 describes. However, there is still a clear alignment presented, as the reviewer is situated within the narrative for the feeling of being \"lost\" to occur. Although \"following\" for R4 is not as intense of a description as \"grabbed\" and \"held\" in R5, we can see that there is still a level of alignment that is arguably understandable from their different review ratings (as R4 rated the novel slightly lower than R5). Their difference also highlights Oatley\u2019s argument that aligning with a text is part of a scale, therefore R4 simply isn\u2019t as far on the \u2018identification scale\u2019 as R5. Therefore, we can see that the use of metaphor for the more positive reviews shows the level of identification that the readers feel through their embodiment of the text. <nl>On the other hand, it is interesting how some of the negative reviews use stake inoculation, which directly contrasts the intense feeling described by the reading metaphors portrayed in the positive reviews. Where the positive reviewers use metaphor in order to portray an alignment with the text, R3 and R2 speak about the same harrowing events within the novel, yet do not use the same language to describe the experience. R2 states very blatantly \"Matt is haunted by his dead brother\", whilst R3 states \"This is an interesting read that deals with mental illness, more particularly schizophrenia, as a result of a boy\u2019s grief over the death of his older brother.\". Where other more positive reviews have discussed the physical grip and transportation that the portrayal of the protagonist\u2019s mental health had on them, we can see with R2 and R3 that there is a very clinical, blunt approach to discussing the topic. Stake inoculation is about a portrayal of being \"considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306), which, when discussing mental health, shows why some who wish to portray themselves in this way would use such clinical language to describe the text. Peplow (2011) discusses how a reader\u2019s positive face can be at risk if they engage in explaining their personal interpretation of a text due to judgement from other readers, therefore this could indicate why some of the reviewers, on a site that is based so largely on user interaction, could use stake inoculation as a means to deter this judgement. <nl>The stark comparison between the positive and negative reviews shows how having an identification stance clearly impacts your perception of a text, as those that do identify describe their reading experience with so much more intensity. On the other hand, the clinical approach of the negative reviews highlights that they simply observed the events without gaining any form of attachment to the protagonist or his struggles, giving a fairly alternate reading experience. <nl>Perceptions of Accuracy:<nl>The majority of the reviews comment on Filer\u2019s accurate depiction of mental health within the novel, arguing his background as a psychiatric nurse enhanced his ability to portray expert knowledge on the topic. Therefore, we can see, even within the negative reviews, one of the main praises is through this depiction of accuracy. However, the important distinction between the positive and negative reviews, despite all of them praising the accurate depiction, is that some reviews can empathise with the accurate depiction, whereas others can simply appreciate. The most negative review, R1, states their appreciation for the accuracy very blatantly; \"\u2026it presents a very realistic glimpse of what mental illness looks and feels like\". Here we see no language that attaches the reader to the narrative; they are embodying the essence of an observer role. R2 is less clinical in language, yet still places themselves outside of the story world; \"You do get a very strong sense of the mental bind that some patients\u2026 get into once they\u2019re sucked into the mental health biz\u2026\". R2 is very informal throughout, therefore their discussion of the accuracy continues this informal language to convey their observer position. This review uses emotive language to describe the actual events of the novel (\"mental bind\", \"sucked into\"), but this language is solely attached to the narrative and not their emotions in relation to said narrative. Similar to the use of stake inoculation discussed previously, the clinical language is used within the more negative reviews as a means to distance themselves from the narrative. Therefore, we can see that again, with such a sensitive topic, the clinical language allows these reviewers to avoid being seen as prejudice (Peplow 2011) by simply outlining events as opposed to exposing their own opinions of said events.<nl>On the other hand, with the more positive reviews, the accuracy only seemed to add to their levels of identification. R5 states \"He [Filer] does not idealise the staff or the patients, both of them have good days and bad days and this was remarkably refreshing.\". Moreover, R3 states \"It is a daring but successful endeavour on the part of the author to unravel the tangled world a person with schizophrenia lives in.\". Here, we can see that identificationobservation is part of a scale, as both the most highly rated review and the neutral review use emotive language which signifies identification. R3\u2019s use of emotive language (\"daring\", \"unravel\", \"tangled\") in isolation invite the assumption of heightened identification, but when we assess within the entire review, this isn\u2019t the case. Whereas R5 discusses the accuracy in the expected manner due to their consistent identification. Oatley (1999) believes first-person narratives invite more of an \"identification\" role, which is reflected within these reviews. Those that do identify can be seen to enter the story world and therefore take on the emotions of the protagonist, meaning the accurate depiction seemingly made this embodiment even more intense. Moreover, Oatley (1995) argues that emotions arise whenif a reader can empathise with the story characters and their struggles, particularly from personal experience, which could indicate why some reviews discuss the text with such identification; if a reader has had personal experiences that are similar to the protagonist, they may be able to identify more heavily than someone who cannot relate in the same way. <nl>When we assess the discussion of accuracy from all of the reviewers, we can see that accuracy as a feature within a novel does not create a heightened level of observation or identification, but instead can be analysed as a discussion point to assess the position of observationidentification. In other words, in some cases it is important to see how readers discuss aspects of a text, as opposed to the specific aspect itself. With this example, language analysis is the focal device to understand the identificationobserver role, as well as highlighting how alignment with a text causes fairly distinctive differences in perceptions of key themes. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Despite using a small data set, I believe there is clear evidence about the factors that indicate the identificationobserver role in relation to The Shock of the Fall, and therefore the aim of this research has been met. It emerged that the positive reviews had identification with the text (seen through emotive language and use of metaphor), and the negative reviews were more observational (seen through stake inoculation and clinical language). However, the slight inconsistencies of these patterns highlight Oatley\u2019s argument that identificationobservation is part of a scale as opposed to two polarised positions. Should this research be extended with a larger data set, I believe more evidence would arise to reflect this scale, and present that not all negative reviews are entirely observational, and not all positive reviews show identification. <nl>It seems the best device to assess the identificationobservation within the reviews was language analysis. The comparison between the different reviews showed that it isn\u2019t necessarily the presence of certain linguistic factors (for example category entitlement), but the discussion of such that show reader positioning; language analysis shows the device as an entity does not lead to an understanding of reader position, but the way it is utilised does. <nl>", "positive": "<nl><nl>Thank you for your response.<nl><nl>Full Name: <part_FN_MN_SN><nl>DOB: &lt;DDMMYYYY&gt;<nl>Email: <email_address><nl><nl>I have also tried to send an email from my other account which you have, but it isn\u2019t currently working.

{"anchor": "Abstract: <nl>This report goes into detail about a study which investigated the type of personality that an individual has whether that is openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (OCEAN) and how it affects the health of an individual from bad eating habits to lifelong illness. The predictions overall were all as expected, that certain personality types have different eating habits. The major findings of the results were the participants overall do not have unhealthy eating behaviours and habits. It could be said that the predictor values have a weak correlational relationship with the FFQ scores, in addition to this the result also show that the personality factors have negative correlations with the FFQ score apart from neuroticism. <nl>Introduction: <nl>Personality as said by Allport in 1961 is a dynamic organisation in an individual of psychophysical systems that create the characteristics, behaviour, thoughts and feelings of a person (Carducci, 2009). Many researchers have looked into the relationship between health and personality and have found that there could be a correlation between them therefore it is important to study more about the topic. Furthermore, by finding out about the correlation between an individual\u2019s personality and eating behaviour it could aid the public health sector. If psychologist are able to develop theories based on the personality types of an individual linked to their eating habits which may be causing them health complications, then individuals may be able to better their health and reduce their issues from the advice they get due to research from psychologist. The widely accepted structure of personality is the \u2018Big 5\u2019 which is the five-factor model test. This is a self-report test that measures the big five personality traits, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN) where individuals have to see how they score by rating each statement regarding how well it describes themselves. After completing this test, the individual can see how their personality traits are and how it may affect their day to day life (Raad &amp; Perugini , 2002).<nl>Predictions:<nl>Based on previous research done by Lunn et al in 2014 it would be correct to predict that individuals with more increased openness will have a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet would be present.  Furthermore, participants with a high conscientiousness  reflect self- discipline and determination, therefore, are also likely to have a general healthy diet therefore it would be right to say that a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet could be predicted. In addition to this, Wicki in 2010 found that stimulation seeking could explain the association between extraversion with alcohol consumption this means they could be prone to bad eating habits. Therefore, extraversion could be positively correlated with an unhealthy diet. Similar to this studies have shown that an individual with more neuroticism could be reliant on bad eating habits and prone to bad health and this is due to their general tension and negative emotions, so they use it to cope. Therefore, it could be predicted that individuals with high neuroticism will have a positive correlation with an unhealthy diet. Lastly, agreeableness needs further investigations, but the prediction could be that they could have a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet, because they are mostly positive and have a positive mindset and therefore this could also lead to a healthier life and healthier mind(Johansen, 2018).<nl><nl>Method<nl>Design:<nl>For this study the independent variable was the personality traits that the participants were being tested on called OCEAN- openness, conscientious, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. A within subjects\u2019 design was used as the participants are answering all of the independent variables on the questionnaire. The dependant variable in this study was the FFQ scores that the participants scored on the test, in this case it would be the unhealthy eating  score. <nl>Participants:<nl>Within this study 195 participants were used from the general population and were aged between 15 and 73 years old (n=195). The participants consisted of both females and males. <nl>Materials:<nl>All participants were given a questionnaire sheet to complete along with a pen. The items used in the FFQ and BFI, the BFI scoring technique can be found in the Hartmann and Johns paper.<nl>Procedure:<nl>For this study firstly informed consent was taken and the participants were aware that they had the right to withdraw at any time during the study. All participants were given the questionnaire to complete within an hour and were told to put a number next to all the statements in the questionnaire. They were asked to answer as honestly as they could and following this all of the questionnaires had their results taken in and were analysed.<nl>Results: <nl><table><nl>From the table you are able to see that the figures for the standardized B are low digits. The correlation is not significant. <nl><table><nl>Discussion:<nl>From the table above you are able to see  correlation did not show a significant association between the personality and health. It could be said that the predictor values have a weak correlational relationship with the FFQ scores, in addition to this the result also show that the personality factors have negative correlations with the FFQ score apart from neuroticism. In addition to this, the descriptive statistics show that the minimum score of the FFQ was 1.50 and the maximum score for the FFQ score was 111.50, which is a large range. Lastly this caused the mean to equal 21.7 and therefore that concludes that the participants overall do not have unhealthy eating behaviours and habits.<nl>These results are what the predictions stated earlier on in the report, e.g. it was predicted that the participants with a high neuroticism FFQ score will have a positive correlation with bad and unhealthy eating habits and this could be due to the fact that they are prone to bad eating habits as a way of coping with their stress. Individuals with the conscientiousness score showed that it was a predictor.<nl>In addition to this, there are logical explanations as to why the study proved the predictions. Firstly, it could be because normally self- report methods are bias on behalf of the participants as they may want to seem and come across better than they actually are, which is known as social desirability bias. In this case, it would have been expected that the participants were giving more desirable answers, and this led to \"healthier\" individuals. This also proves that previous research is accurate. Due to these results it is evident that the correlational study is reliable and holds high validity.", "positive": "r <organisation> recruitment team, <nl><nl>I hope you are well and this reaches you in the best of health.

{"anchor": "Thank you for visiting. <nl><nl>Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee\u2019s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. <nl><nl>You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work.<nl><nl>Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant\u2019s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is \u00a352,000, any award exceeding \u00a325,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder\u2019s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee\u2019s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks\u2019 notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks\u2019 notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks\u2019 worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal\u2019s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use \u2018other substantial reason,\u2019 ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be \u2018misconduct,\u2019 regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder\u2019s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>\u2022 No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>\u2022 Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>\u2022 Narinder\u2019s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>\u2022 The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder\u2019s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>\u2022 Same as Option 1. <nl>\u2022 WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder\u2019s behaviour. <nl>\u2022 WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>\u2022 Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>\u2022 Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 You will be free from Narinder\u2019s treatment. <nl>\u2022 You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>\u2022 You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>\u2022 You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>\u2022 Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>\u2022 You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>\u2022 Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>\u2022 Same as Option 4.<nl>\u2022 There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks\u2019 worth salary (\u00a310,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately \u00a34,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (\u00a31,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your \u2018Christmas [bonus]\u2019 regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual \u2018right[s] to receive.\u2019 <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days\u2019 leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days\u2019 worth salary (\u00a33,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals \u00a319,263.96. This includes notice salary (\u00a310,000), Pension (\u00a34,000), untaken leave (\u00a33,703.96) and Christmas bonus (\u00a31,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals \u00a317,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals \u00a311,763.96 or \u00a310,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal\u2019s maximum award of \u00a325,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. <nl><nl>Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. <nl>Basic Award <nl>Tribunal will award you \u00a36,300 based on your weekly gross salary (\u00a3525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. <nl><nl>Compensatory Award<nl>The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (\u00a378,000), as it is below \u00a386,444 cap. This may be lower (\u00a325,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job.<nl><nl>If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (\u00a384,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. <nl><nl>Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this.  The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. <nl><nl>Additional information<nl>Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract.<nl><nl>Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. <nl><nl>I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely, <nl>", "positive": "r <addr7_NN>,<nl><nl>I hope you\u2019re well. <nl><nl>I\u2019m in a sticky situation regarding the submission of my <module> Summative. <nl><nl>I have written confirmation from one of my <module> module tutors (<pers_FN>) that this assignment does not require a bibliography.

{"anchor": "Abstract <nl>59 undergraduate psychology students replicated the Stroop test (Stroop, 1935) by identifying the colour of the font of 60 stimulus words in two conditions: congruent, where the ink colour is consistent with the word itself, and incongruent, where the ink colour is different to the word itself. The results showed that the reaction time for the incongruent condition was longer than the congruent condition. This can be supported by the selective attention theory, which states that it requires more attention to name the ink colours than to read the words (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The future implications of the Stroop test and results of the study involve the ability to identify certain brain regions (MacLeod, 2015). <nl>Introduction<nl>The Stroop Test, introduced by Stroop (1935), is a neuropsychological test which assesses the ability to suppress cognitive interference when the processing of one stimulus slows down the processing of a second stimulus (Scarpina and Tagini, 2017). In Stroop\u2019s first experiment, he used five words and their matching ink colours, and participants were instructed to read each word aloud as fast as possible. In experiment 2, participants had to read the ink colours aloud rather than the word itself. The experimental condition was incongruent as the word was not the same as the colour of the ink. Participants had a longer reaction time when they were instructed to name the ink colour of the incongruent words compared to the congruent words in the control condition (MacLeod, 1991). <nl>This effect can be explained by the selective attention theory, as naming the ink colours required more attention than reading the words, hence these simultaneous stimuli were processed differently (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The interference Stroop effect demonstrated further led to the development of the Stroop Test. Literature suggests that this is a consistent effect, with results of the Stroop test having high reliability (Siegrist, 1995). This gives rise to the hypothesis that the reaction time for the incongruent condition, where the words and font colour are different, will be longer than the congruent condition.<nl>Method<nl>Participants:<nl>59 undergraduate psychology students from their first year at Aston University were recruited for this experiment via opportunity sampling.<nl><nl>Design:<nl>The design was repeated measures and the independent variable was the congruency of the font colour and the meaning of the word itself, with two levels being congruent and incongruent. The dependent variable was the reaction time (in milliseconds) for participants to name the font colour in each condition.<nl><nl>Materials:<nl>PsychoPy was used to implement the design of the experiment and collect reaction time data. The stimulus words for the congruent condition were \u2018red\u2019 in a red font, \u2018green\u2019 in a green font, and \u2018blue\u2019 in a blue font. The stimulus words for the incongruent condition were \u2018red\u2019 in a green font, \u2018green\u2019 in a blue font, and \u2018blue\u2019 in a red font. The response options available were the left arrow for red, the up arrow for green, and the right arrow for blue. <nl><nl>Procedure:<nl>Participants gave informed consent prior to conducting the experiment. They were instructed to identify the colour of the font the word was printed in, by pressing the corresponding responses on the keyboard. The stimuli were presented in a randomised and counterbalanced order. Participants saw the 6 stimulus types 10 times, with 60 trials in total. They then identified the colour of the font of the words by pressing the keyboard as fast as possible, with the keyboard response signalling the next trial. The reaction times for each trial were stored and saved for further analysis.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Table 1.<nl><table><nl><nl>As the hypothesis suggested, the mean for the incongruent condition is higher than the congruent condition (Table 1). The low standard deviations show that results did not vary highly in both conditions, suggesting that results may be consistent within each condition. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in reaction times between incongruent and congruent conditions at a 95% confidence level (Z= -3.638, p= .001). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The research hypothesis was supported as the reaction time for the incongruent condition was significantly longer than that of the congruent condition, which was consistent with previous research by Stroop (1935).<nl>A limitation of the study was the small sample size and type of participants tested, as the results from only 59 undergraduate psychology students fail to produce an accurate representation of the general population. This is shown by Hackshaw (2008), explaining that small sample sizes produce results which overestimate the magnitude of the difference. To improve this, a wider sample size extending outside of the university would be required to assess whether the results are truly reliable. Additionally, the risk of demand characteristics due to the Stroop test being well-known may mean that participants would deliberately take a longer time to identify the colour of the font in the incongruent condition compared to the congruent condition. Research participants are likely to hypothesise an aim of the study when they are aware that they are being observed (Hogg and Cooper, 2007). This could be remedied by introducing a pilot study where participants are asked about their perception of the aim of the study upon completion, allowing for the adaptation of the instructions and presentation of stimuli according to their responses. <nl>Future implications of the Stroop test include its ability in testing the function of associated brain regions (MacLeod, 2015), and the understanding of cognitive interference. This therefore allows for further research on brain regions related to the Stroop test, assisting in treatment and recovery of individuals with brain damage in these areas. Future research testing various groups of people, such as cognitively impaired, could provide useful when investigating which brain regions affect reaction times in the incongruent condition, demonstrating the full extent of the effect of the Stroop test.", "positive": "<addr2_FN>,<nl><nl>I am writing as a follow up to my Instagram DM to enquire if you would be interested in hosting a talk on <day> <DDth> <month> at 2pm on ZoomMicrosoft Teams on your <course> journey or a topic of your choosing. <nl>I really believe that your story will be inspiring to my society members and they will benefit greatly from a likeminded individual explaining what they did to get where they are. <nl><nl>I look forward to your reply,<nl><nl>Thank you,<nl><nl><part_FN_SN><nl>President of <society> <YYYY><YY><new>Hi <addr12_FN>, I am reaching out to introduce myself as <part_FN> your peer mentor!<nl><nl>I am a current Second year student from <city> at <university> studying <course>, and am also the President of <society> this year. <nl><nl>If you have any questions related to uni life, the course, settling in, or just want a chat, please don't hesitate to ask.<nl><nl>If you prefer to contact me via mobile please let me know,<nl><nl>Kind regards<nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr4_FN>,<nl><nl>The first event was really good!

{"anchor": "\"Intro <nl>The Alpha Inhibition Hypothesis (AIH) is when high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas. \u00a0the current experiment tested the alpha inhibition hypothesis using a cued visual attention task and predicted that; if recording from the left parietal lobe participants' alpha range activities would be higher in the cue left than cue right condition.<nl>Method<nl>A partial replication of an experiment was conducted, and it included recording alpha amplitudes from the left parietal lobe (P3), analysing the activity 200ms before stimulus onset in the cue left and cue right conditions.<nl>Results <nl>The results were significant and were consistent with the hypothesis. It can be concluded that the results supported the theory that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. <nl>Experiment write up, 1200 +- 10% (min1080, max1320) words, titles, title page tables, figures &amp; reference list not included in count<nl>Introduction<nl>The AIH, states that more alpha activity in one hemisphere leads to loss of attention and the disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (the other hemisphere), this indicates inhibition. Whereas less activity in one hemisphere leads to the opposite; an increase in attention and engagement (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha activity or waves are a type of brain wave. They are produced in circumstances of rest, especially when your eyes are closed and happen before you fall asleep (Alpha Waves and How They Help You Sleep, n.d.). <nl>The AIH is supported with research such as (Handel et al., 2011) who used a MEG (magneto-encephalogram) which has better spatial resolution and similar temporal resolution to an EEG for better results. They found that alpha activity is reduced in contralateral brain areas to the stimuli presented, that alpha activity is influenced by attention. <nl>A partial replication of Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) experiment: \"A shift of visual spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\", was conducted to compare alpha amplitudes at P3 between conditions and prove the hypothesis that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. As stimuli always processes contralaterally (opposite side of activity) We wanted to find out whether if, a side of the visual field was cued, would it lead to alpha inhibition on the contralateral side where participants anticipated the stimuli would appear? And which side would show bigger alpha amplitudes?<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>38 undergraduate students took part in the research via volunteer sampling, there were originally 39, but one participant\u2019s data were removed as their data were only available for one of the two conditions. <nl>Design<nl>The design of the study was a repeated measure, the independent variable was whether the arrow cues pointed left or right, it also had two levels known as cue left and cue right. The dependent variable was the alpha amplitudes measured in \u00b5V (microvolts), recorded from P3.<nl>Materials<nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to collect data and EEG Electrodes were attached to participants\u2019 scalps using AC cream, Everi cream. PsychoPy software was used to present stimuli for a specific period of time and send event markers set to end immediately to Biopac, through a Stimtracker device. The Stimuli used were two white bars on a black background, one large, one small (see figure 1). Two arrows, one pointing left and one pointing right (see figure 2). And white fixation cross (see figure 3). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Firstly, the Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz, digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and Stimtracker, event markers let us know when stimuli were shown. Calculation channels were set up to record activity in the alpha frequency range from 8-13Hz before checking the impedance, with the sampling rate being 1000 Hz, alpha amplitudes were also measured.  Participants had EEG electrodes with AC cream on them placed on their scalps using the 1020 positioning system (Trans-Cranial Techologies.,2012), with P3 being recorded. The active electrode was placed at P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz, an earth electrode was attached to the forehead near the hairline and everything was measured relative to Cz.The areas were scrubbed with Everi cream beforehand for better adhesion. They were then asked to complete a cued visual attention task using PsychoPy. <nl>Cued with a fixation cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms an arrow indicating whether it would be the left or right side of the visual field the target, would appear, in the centre of the screen for 34ms whilst participants were asked by the experimenter to focus their attention to that side of the visual field. There was 50% chance of being cued left or right. There were different event markers for cue left and right conditions and they were sent at stimulus onset. There were 20 blocks of 4 trial types, each block had cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) randomised within blocks with half of trials cued left and half cued right. <nl><nl>Results<nl>The raw 9-13Hz Alpha EEG data for each condition was analysed using the event markers sent from PsychoPy to identify when the stimuli would be presented. We looked at the period of 200ms of recorded activity before stimulus presentation, after arrow cues had been shown and used Biopac by rectifying and averaging over 50 samples of raw alpha data to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. This smooths out the data (averaging over samples), reduces the impact of outlyingextreme values and converts negative values to positive, so we get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. <nl>Statistical Analysis<nl>Table 1 shows that the rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were higher in the cue left condition than the cue right condition. According to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the difference was significant, and the inferential statistics are as follows (t=566, n=38, p&lt;0.005). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were significant, so we used a non-parametric test to find the inferential statistics from the data collected. The results fit with the hypothesis as the results are consistent with AIH as recorded activity from P3cue left were higher than cue right, which were the task irrelevant brain areas, suggesting that alpha suppression happened there.<nl>Methodological issues that could have affected the results could have been varying levels of impedance, associated with more variance in the measurements but would affect both conditions equally. Another methodological issue that could have affected results could have been artefacts, such as blinking, that would affect the waves. From the experiment overall, I conclude that the AIH is highly supported by research as it has high temporal reliability, and despite all the methodological issues, the results are still valid.\"", "positive": "t loan?

{"anchor": "Police interviewing with eyewitnesses and victims has always been subject to scrutiny by psychologists and legal professionals. Over the past years, there has been significant psychological research in this area, with various new techniques being introduced and implemented in police training to ensure testimonies of eyewitnesses, victims, and suspects to be as accurate as possible. While these techniques can be applied to both eyewitnesses and suspects, victims of crime need particular care and consideration when being interviewed about the crime. One example of such victims are sexual assault victims. Studies have shown that only 16-20% of rape victims report the crime to the police or other legal justice systems (Kilpatrick et al.,1992). There are many reasons for such a low rate of reports; victims are likely to have PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020), they may be worried about confidentiality during interviews, both of which tie in with the belief that there\u2019s a lack of training in police training when conducting interviews with sexual assault victims (Rich and Seffrin, 2012). This essay considers these factors and proposes two recommendations that the police should consider when interviewing sexual assault victims; 1) rapport building (Holmberg, 2004; Collins et al., 2002) and 2) the combination of the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992) and an WRIP approach (Heydon and Powell, 2016).<nl><nl>A potential factor to consider when interviewing sexual assault victims is the method of  interviewing. A survey study has shown that among 429 police officers in the USA, many of them were not sufficiently skilled in conducting interviews with victims of sexual assault (Rich and Seffrin, 2012).  Such lack of training negatively impacts the volume of sexual assault reports the justice system receives. Therefore, it is important to implement a technique that addresses this issue of lack of training and in turn, encourages more victims to come forward and report sexual assault incidents. <nl>A key element of any police interview is rapport building. Rapport building is a type of effective communication skill (Vallano et al, 2015) that is characterised by establishing a positive and comfortable relationship and atmosphere between the interviewer and interviewee (Vallano and Campo, 2011). There are multiple ways in which a police interviewer can establish rapport with a sexual assault victim; addressing the victim by their name, active listening, adopting open body language (matching and mirroring the interviewee\u2019s body language (Boe, 2009)), and maintaining frequent eye contact (St-Yves, 2006). Indeed, Holmberg (1994) (as cited in Holmberg, 2004) found that when rapport was used in an interview with a rape victim, the victim was more willing to narrate about the crime event as she claimed the interviewer encouraged her to describe the events in \"such an intimate way\" and felt he was doing it for \"her sake\" and not because it was \"for the investigation\". Moreover, Keats (1993) also found that when the technique of rapport-building was used in interviews, both the interviewer and interviewee were comfortable and appeared to freely discuss the events of the incident all while the interviewee demonstrated willingness to co-operate with the investigation.<nl><nl>Another advantage of rapport building is that it seems to elicit more correctly recalled information and more detailed information (Pinizzotto &amp; Davis, 1996; Collins et al., 2002). Therefore, not only does this technique increase willingness in victims to come forward and report sexual assault crimes, but it also increases the quality and quantity of information recalled by interviewees, an aspect that has always been a drawback of investigative interviewing.<nl>However, as with any recommendation, there are a few limitations to consider. While the notion of rapport-building is commonly known in the legal justice system and highly recommended by researchers and practitioners (Abbe and Brandon, 2013), it is important to note that the definition of rapport-building is not clear-cut, that is, much of the literature surrounding this technique includes a variety of definitions. While some researchers claim rapport-building involves creating a positive and friendly relationship with the interviewee (Collins et al., 2002; Hartwig et al., 2005; Vallano and Compo, 2011), others argue that it is defined as a neutral, working relationship between the two parties (Abbe and Brandon, 2013). With such conflicting definitions, it is hard for police interviewers to gauge a comprehensive understanding of rapport-building and hence may result in them not using the technique to its full potential.<nl>Nevertheless, a questionnaire study conducted on 221 police interviewers in the UK revealed that police officers reported using rapport 87% of the time during their investigations with witnesses (Dando et al., 2008). This suggests that despite the contradicting definitions of rapport-building, police officers are still seeing the value in the technique and as a result, are implementing it in their interviews. Therefore, rapport-building is a valuable and effective technique that should be administered during interviews with sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>Another key reason as to why many sexual assault victims do not come forward and seek help from the legal justice system is because many of them experience PTSD. Around two thirds of women were reported to have features of PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020). This may lead to victims being scared to come forward as they believe that the police would not be trained to efficiently deal with their trauma and fail to understand them. <nl>An example of police interviewing technique that the police are required to use in their investigative interviews is the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). As well as the 4 main stages of the interview \u2013 mental reinstatement of context, reporting from a different perspective, reverse order reporting and in-depth reporting \u2013 the interview, more importantly, involves an introduction and a \u2018transfer control\u2019 phase (Geiselman and Fisher, 2014). During the introduction, the interviewer asks the interviewee simple questions, attempting to build rapport. In the \u2018transfer control\u2019 phase, the interviewer informs the interviewee that they are the expert since they were at the scene themselves. These two steps are crucial in that they enable the interviewee to have a more favourable experience of the interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 2010), meaning their satisfaction levels of police services are likely to increase. These satisfaction levels, in turn, are linked to reduced levels of PTSD type symptoms (Kunst et al., 2013) in interviewees who have experienced traumatising events, such as sexual assault. <nl><nl>While the Cognitive Interview has many benefits and has been found to improve total and correct recall more so than the standard interview (Gwyer and Clifford, 1997), there are problems with its practical application. One problem is that police officers believe the interview is very time consuming and takes longer to conduct than a standard interview and thus, cannot conduct the full interview (Kebbell et al., 1999). Another issue is that it requires significant levels of concentration and cognitive demands on the police interviewer (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992; Kebbell et al, 1999). <nl>Therefore, with these limitations in mind, Heydon and Powell (2016) propose a possible technique that could be introduced to police interview training, as an addition to the traditional interviewing techniques, known as written-response interview protocol (WRIP). This approach involves anonymous and confidential written reporting options for sexual assault victims commonly before a traditional interview. An example of a WRIP approach could be that victims of sexual assault write their story in their own time \u2013 whenever they feel ready \u2013 with prompts and guidelines designed to focus their writing on key points as well as maximise their recall. This written format can then be followed up with a formal interview. In terms of anonymous reporting, a WRIP that aims to achieve this should include instructions that are consistent with the Cognitive Interview techniques. For instance, a WRIP for confidential reporting must begin with an \u2018Engage and Explain\u2019 phase that includes the Cognitive Interview\u2019s \u2018report everything\u2019 phase. While still remaining anonymous, it is important to still engage with the interviewee, to show sensitivity to them. Thus, it is evident that this approach allows police interviewers to have a lot of flexibility when interviewing sexual assault victims. <nl><nl>With the WRIP approach, many of the Cognitive Interview limitations are addressed. By allowing victims to record their experiences themselves as soon as possible after the crime, the police interviewers can use those initial reports for reference during the face-to-face interview phase, reducing the cognitive demands imposed on them by the interview technique and reducing the time it takes to conduct a full interview. Furthermore, by incorporating these two techniques together, the victims\u2019 satisfaction levels, rapport building, and the quality of their testimonies are not compromised, rather they are further encouraged. However, it is vital to note that there has been no further research on the combination of these two techniques and their validity in real life situations. Nevertheless, theoretically, this collaboration appears to be the \u2018Golden Standard\u2019 and \u2018fool-proof\u2019 in the context of investigative interviewing. Therefore, with such considerations in mind, the combinations of these techniques should be considered as a practice for gathering evidence from sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>In conclusion, interviewing sexual assault victims is tricky. Regardless of age, gender, size, etc. reflecting and talking about such traumatic events is not easy for any individual. It is possible that it is because of this sensitivity of the topic that many victims are reluctant to come forward and report the crimes done to them. Nevertheless, it is the legal justice system\u2019s responsibility that they have such measures in place that allow the victims to feel even a little bit of comfort when coming forward. It is the police\u2019s responsibility to ensure the victims feel as if they made the right choice by reporting the crime. Considering some of the factors that might prevent victims from coming forward, this essay proposes two main recommendations that the police could potentially introduce in their practice. Both of these recommendations have a key thing in common \u2013 building rapport. Thus, it can be concluded that in any type of investigative interviewing, building rapport is the most important aspect.", "positive": "<addr1_FN>, <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I'd like to have a final meeting with you this coming week to just talk about some final points regarding my dissertation. <nl><nl> <nl><nl>When would be best for you?<new>I think 5:30pm would work.

{"anchor": "Dear CEO, With regards to your upcoming conference in Helsinki from the 2nd to 4th September, I have researched and identified the relevant itinerary items for your trip. - I have identified two potential accommodations within the \u00a3200 per night budget: 1. Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for \u00a3308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for \u00a3250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra \u00a316 per night (totalling \u00a3342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay.

With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel.<nl><nl>Positioning<nl>As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost.<nl>To identify Car Club\u2019s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. <nl>Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers\u2019 initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people.<nl><figure><nl>If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of \u00a33.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around \u00a32.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It\u2019s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. <nl>Sixt and Avis start at \u00a351 (Sixt 2020) and \u00a360 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of \u00a336day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs.<nl>The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club\u2019s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility.<nl>In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success.<nl><figure><nl>Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team!<nl>The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club\u2019s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category.<nl><nl>Car Club\u2019s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so.<nl>From Car Club\u2019s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham.<nl><figure><nl>Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives.<nl><nl>Campaign Objectives<nl>1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population)<nl>As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham\u2019s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher\u2019s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club\u2019s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention.<nl><nl>2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher\u2019s fairs within the city<nl>Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users\u2019 involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. <nl><nl>Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools<nl>The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming.<nl>Push strategy \u2013 Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student\u2019s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise\u2019s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors.<nl><nl>Pull strategy \u2013 This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers\u2019 minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness.<nl>As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers\u2019 positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion.<nl><nl>Marketing tools plan<nl>Personal selling<nl>Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication \u2026 in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy \u2026 a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers\u2019 presence on campus at  fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club\u2019s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. <nl><nl>Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use.<nl>Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise\u2019s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. <nl>Testing<nl>Personal sellers\u2019 ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher\u2019s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the  venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data.<nl>Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments.<nl><nl>Advertising<nl>Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication \u2026 designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS\u2019 lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that  \"77%\u00a0of students are using Instagram, and\u00a075%\u00a0are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club\u2019s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students\u2019 social-media usage whilst remaining affordable.<nl>Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness.<nl><nl>Integration of marketing communications <nl>Enterprise\u2019s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 as they are socially active \u2018communaholics\u2019, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide.<nl>Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company\u2019s market position and standing by Enterprise\u2019s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service.<nl>The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online.<nl><nl>Implementation plan<nl>Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April \u2013 Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops.<nl>Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn\u2019t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "positive": "<addr17_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you for the tips, I have made these changes.
