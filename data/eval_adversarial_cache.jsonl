{"anchor": "<question1><nl>Reasoning has two explanations which have differences and similarities between them. Firstly, inductive reasoning is a process where a subject has a specific argument meaning the argument is related to true facts whereas within an inductively valid argument the conclusion is general (General Books, 2013). Therefore, the conclusion and overall argument is logically true however it may or may not be realistically true. For example, it could be said that \"all strawberries are a fruit\" (specific statement), another statement could be \"the bag is full of fruits\", (specific statement), which for inductive reasoning would lead to a general conclusion, being \"the bag is full of strawberries.\" This conclusion may or not be true as we are unsure of the contents in the bag and it could include other fruits such as grapes or apples etc. <nl>On the other hand, deductive reasoning has a different approach to arguments where instead of having a specific argument leading to a general conclusion, the subject has a general argument which isn\u2019t really specific to the end conclusion however within the deductively valid argument the conclusion is specific, therefore it is both logically and realistically true (Jonathon and Evans, 2013). An example of this is if there was a general statement such as \"all strawberries are fruits\" and another general statement such as \"all fruits have seeds\" then the specific conclusion would be \"strawberries have seeds\". This conclusion is logically and realistically true. <nl>Furthermore, another difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is deductive reasoning problems can be resolved without real world knowledge. This is because it is argued that deduction is more likely to be deliberate and involved with rule-based practises compared to induction which is more influenced by context, which suggest that there are two alternative and distinct forms of reasoning (General Books, 2013). <nl><question2><nl>In 1996 \u2018Wasons Selection task\u2019 was developed which was based on the ruling \"if P then Q\" - if P is true then so is Q. For example, participants will be shown four cards I, K, 4,7 and be told the rule \"if a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other side.\" Participants would then be asked to turn over the minimum number of cards they think would be sufficient enough to prove the rule. However, most participants struggle with this task as they may overlook a card that could falsify the rule (Eysenck, 2004).<nl>This is because the participants have insight into the logical structure of the problem. This is based on the insight model developed in 1972 which suggested that the chances of being successful on a task depends on the participants level of insight (Eysenck, 2004). Insight has three levels, the first being no insight therefore participants will choose the cards mentioned in the rule because they think only confirming the rule is priority. In this example the participant would choose the cards \"I\" and \"4\" and could be identified as matching bias. Partial insight is the second level when the participant realises that confirming and falsifying the rule is important, therefore they would turn over \"I\", \"4\" and \"K\", the \"K\" would be falsifying. Full insight is then the highest level of insight and is when the participants will only select cards that falsify the rule, meaning the \"K\" and \"7\" card would be selected. <nl>Furthermore, it could be said that the task is so difficult due to the abstract content that is used on the participants. In conditions where concrete content is used opposed to abstract content, 60% of the participants correctly selected the P card and not the Q card (Manktelow , 1999). <nl><question3><nl>Subjective Expected utility is the theory on how to make optimal decisions. Five main axioms are used as a foundation to the theory which maximizes an individuals expected utility in decisions made. Predictions have been derived from initial axioms in order to test whether the theory can be used from psychological approach (Chavas, 2004). <nl>Transivity is the first principle where if A is preferred to B and B to C then A should be preferred to C. Nevertheless, in 1969 Tversky suggested that if decisions are complex, order preference becomes intransitive as individuals can only focus on one attribute in decision making. Invariance is the second where A is preferred to B or B to A therefore choice preference shouldn\u2019t impact their description. However, research has proved that if they are presented with two versions of a problem its more likely that there\u2019s a preference for A to be in version one but B to A in version two. Independence is the third principle where if A is preferred to B, it shouldn\u2019t depend on anything the choices have in common. However, the Allais paradox states that when presented with two, individuals will prefer A to B in gamble 1 but B to A in gamble 2. Within the independence principle it states that preferences should not be affected. (Chavas, 2004).<nl>In addition, another explanation is the prospect theory which states when it is time for decision making, a person will assess their gains and losses from a decision relative to certain reference points, for example the present situation they are involved in or the way in which a decision is framed. This is done as an alternative to basing decisions on an absolute value. (Chavas, 2004)<nl><question4><nl><figure><nl>Problem solving is defined as a goal that is to be reached but an individual is not sure on how to do it. The problem in this diagram is about a student who cannot achieve higher than a C in their maths class, which is leading them to get a low outcomes, but they desire to get above a C in their overall GCSE math class. The problem that I have described above in the diagram is a well define problem which has three elements to it, being a starting state (getting lower grades than a C in math), a goal state (getting above a C) and a fixed set of operators that transforms these states (feedback and working on past papers). The method of problem solving that is being used is algorithmic procedures which means that there is a solution to the problem however the downfall is it may be a very slow process to get to the end goal. Within this diagram it displays simple steps to get to the end goals such as working on past papers and gaining feedback, however this may take a long time depending on the individual. For example, if their working at grade is a D it may take less time and they could be at a C within 3 week. Nevertheless, there is a definite solution solutions to the problem.<nl>Evidently this state action tree is using a heuristic search method, more specifically the hill climbing technique which means to always choose the move that will get you closer to the goal state (Manktelow, 1999). Within my diagram above every step that is taken, whether that is feedback or past papers, it will bring the student closer to its goal state of getting above a C in math. <nl><question5><nl>Creativity is defined as an insightful or unusual solution which is valuable (Pope, 2005). A solution that is creativity must be valuable and useful in one way or another and has to be understood and noticed by society. There are four main perspectives that could be used to discover more about creativity, which is based on studying creative people, the creative process, the creative product of the environment of creativity. <nl>It was said that creativity can be assessed using the psychometric approach which Guilford in 1956 distinguished into two ways of thinking. Convergent thinking is when the individual converges the correct answer and the best answer to a problem. Whereas the other type of thinking that Guilford suggested was divergent thinking which is when the individual develops many different solutions to the same problem, and this requires more flexibility, wider thinking and originality. Divergent thinking was considered a form of creativity which Guilford attempted to conceptualize, however an issue with this was that these tests can often confuse creativity and intelligence or creativity and originality therefore it may be hard to distinguish. <nl>Furthermore, another way that creativity can be assessed is the biographic and autographic approach where Wallas in 1926 identified four stages of creative process. First being preparation which is when background knowledge is absorbed, also incubation which is when the problem is dismissed for any reason. Wallas also said that inspiration was art of the creative process which is when the solution is developed for the first time. Lastly, verification is part of the creative process when the individual confirms whether the solution was successful or not. These stages were proved with evidence regarding the assessment of creativity, however with the exclusion of incubation. The incubation period has still remained controversial regarding the creativity process.", "positive": " u bipolar \ud83d\udc80<new>Shutup<new>Are u goood bro<new>Nah maynnnn<new>My fone died and then I died<new>I misssss u \ud83d\ude0c<new>Why what\u2019s wrong<new>Are u okay ??<new>What happened ?<new>Are u ok?<new>Bad<new>How u feeling<new>Love it<new>And a fat head<new>\ud83d\ude0c<new>U do boo<new>Don\u2019t doubt urself<new>Ain\u2019t started today<new>Wyd<new>Yhhhh<new>Wyd<new>Awww that\u2019s good u can chill a little<new>Don\u2019t avoid me g<new>Morning \ud83e\udd15<new>Hey<new>My dad just gave me lemsip<new>Just drinking<new>Wyd<new>Yah<new>I want to but if u don\u2019t mind getting ill<new>:)<new>Good don\u2019t complain later x<new>\ud83d\ude0c\ud83e\udd70<new>U asked<new>Gimme 5 hours x<new>Nah I\u2019ll be out in 1.5 don\u2019t cry xx<new>Yh<new>Bro I literally slept long today", "attacked": "I'm struggling with bipolar disorder and wondering what might have occurred."}

{"anchor": "<question1><nl><nl>The period of adolescence is a time where behaviour is characterised by impulsivity, increased risk taking and an affinity for peer groups (Spear, 2010). During no other period in the lifespan is the prevalence of death so high relative to health, with Steinberg (2013) reporting a dramatic spike in self-inflicted behaviours such as car accidents and crime. Adolescent behaviour and the reasons for its occurrence has posed a particular question for researchers. <nl><nl>The duel systems process model proposes that adolescent typical behaviour is caused by a developmental imbalance between the subcortical socioemotional system implicated in sensitivity to rewards and novelty, relative to the cognitive control system responsible for impulse and emotional control as well as decision making (Shulman et al, 2016). The model hypothesises that the early activation and maturation of the ventral striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) in early adolescence increases one\u2019s propensity for sensation seeking whilst the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is still maturing, therefore attenuating impulse control (Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2011). It is predicted that sensation seeking behaviour increases at the early stages of adolescence and levels off as adulthood is reached, following an inverted \u2018U\u2019 shape trajectory. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob (2011) assessed this using longitudinal data from over 7000 participants aged 12-24, looking at self-reported changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking. They found that mean levels of impulsivity declined through adolescence and levelled off when participants reached their mid-20s, consistent with neurobiological research suggesting heightened activation of the ventral striatum in early to mid-adolescence relative to children and adults (Barkley-Leveson &amp; Galv\u00e1n, 2014). This supports the claim that adolescent typical behaviour is a product of nature due to the profound influence of brain structures and their relative levels of maturity on sensation seeking behaviour.  Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob\u2019s (2011) research is one of the first to report this trend using longitudinal data and to utilise such a large sample, representative of a diverse population. Furthermore, the use of such a large data set reduced the chance of type I errors. However, caution should be taken when drawing conclusions due to the risk of social desirability and response bias when using measures of self-report. <nl><nl>It has been asserted by some researchers that adolescents possess the ability to evaluate risky decisions to the same level as adults (Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006), begging the questions as to why this age group engage in risk behaviours to such a degree? Observational data suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents heightened propensity for risk (Albert et al, 2013) with researchers suggesting adaptive benefits such as increasing peer status and peer affiliation with desirable social groups (Spear, 2010). Steinberg &amp; Gardener (2005) assessed the effects of peer contexts on risky decision making in 3 age groups including adolescents (13-16), youths (18-22) and adults (24+). All 306 participants completed 3 measures of risk orientation including 2 self-report measures and a computerised driving task named the Chicken Game. In this task participants were required to make decisions about whether to advance the vehicle once a traffic light turns from green to yellow (meaning an impending red light) with the possibility of a car crash if the car advances through a red light. Participants were randomly assigned either the peer condition where they would complete the task with 2 others or the alone condition. Steinberg &amp; Gardener found that each group engaged in comparable risk taking when alone but increased risk taking when in the presence of peers, more pronounced during middle and late adolescence. This suggest adolescents\u2019 susceptibility to peer influence relative to adults when taking risk, implying the role of nurture and social contexts in adolescent typical behaviours. This study has important implications for interventions seeking to reduce risky behaviour amongst adolescence (i.e. juvenile delinquency) suggesting attention should be directed towards increasing resistance to peer influence in young people. However, this study has arguably low ecological validity as it unable to capture the complex dynamic of risk taking with peers outside of a laboratory setting.<nl><nl>In conclusion the cause of adolescent behaviour appears to be a combination of both nature and nurture influences, with research suggesting that peer influence may increase the brain\u2019s risk and reward system sensitivity (Albert et al, 2013). Subsequently, the duel process model and effects of peer stimuli may co-influence risky behaviours seen in adolescents as young people spend most of their time with peers (Spear, 2010). Therefore, the claim that adolescent behaviour reflects the influence of nature more so than nurture is not supported. <nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Research suggest adolescence is the greatest risk period for the emergence of psychopathological disorders, with mental illness affecting 1 in 5 young people (Powers &amp; Casey, 2015). In light of this, this essay shall seek to critically discuss how brain development may facilitate the high prevalence of psychopathology during adolescence.<nl><nl>Stress has been considered an important factor contributing to adolescents\u2019 vulnerability to internalising disorders, namely anxiety (Romeo, 2010). Brain areas identified as being implicated in this increased vulnerability includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which undergoes significant maturational changes and a reawakening during puberty (Spear, 2010). The HPA axis is responsible for controlling stress-induced hormonal secretion in response to stressors and does so by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation (McCormick et al.,2010). Once released, ACHT acts to increase the production and release of glucocorticoid hormones, which then act upon the brain to predetermine future responses to future stress stimuli. Using a battery of acute stressors, Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) assessed the hormonal stress response of prepubescent rats, compared to that of adult rats and found a greater, more prolonged ACHT and corticosterone response in the younger rats compared to adults. Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) suggested that it takes twice as long for these hormones to return to baseline level in premid-adolescent rats following stress stimuli relative to adult rats. Reflective of the results seen in animals, researchers have speculated that anxious individuals may show a delayed HPA axis recovery following a stressor, which in turn may make them slower to adjust to novelty, giving rise to psychopathological vulnerabilities (Spear, 2010). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results to human behaviour because of the use of animal data. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess levels of glucocorticoid in human adolescents because of the natural diurnal release rhythm it follows (Spear, 2010), meaning animal studies have provided a valuable opportunity to investigate this, whilst having strong experimental control. Furthermore, animal research is able to bypass the ethical implications to be considered when conducting human research (Eiland &amp; Romeo, 2013). <nl><nl>Attention deficithyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be defined as inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity relative to an individual\u2019s age, that interferes with their functioning (Shaw et al., 2012). Onset of ADHD is around 7 years (occurring before puberty) and is prevalent in over 5% of children worldwide (Friedman &amp; Rapoport, 2015). Research has suggested that brain development through late childhood and adolescence is an important factor contributing to ADHD. Shaw et al (2007) assessed this using a longitudinal MRI scan study of 223 ADHD diagnosed participants matched with 223 typically developing (TD) controls.  Shaw and colleagues found a marked delay in ADHD in achieving peak cortical thickness throughout the cerebrum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). This delay was most pronounced in the middle and lateral PFC, implicated in higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and planning, where peak thickness was achieved 5 years later than TD controls. In addition to this it was seen that the primary motor cortex conversely showed early maturation in ADHD (peaking age 7 years), when compared to controls (peaking age 7.4 years). Shaw and colleagues speculated that the delayed developmental trajectory of regions implicated in higher-order motor control, paired with the early maturation of the primary motor cortex may account for symptoms seen in ADHD i.e. poor motor control. This influential study was seen to be the first longitudinal neuroanatomic research evidencing the theory of delayed cortical maturation in ADHD, due to the advanced in MRI techniques seen in recent history. However, it should be noted that the results cannot endorse differences in intelligence and sexual dimorphisms seen in ADHD, despite their effect on cortical development because they strictly controlled for in the design. <nl><nl>To conclude brain maturation and development in adolescents, relative to adults seems to have implications for various psychopathologies. Spear (2010) suggests for disorders like ADHD where onset occurs just prior to adolescence, motor control regions may show developmental anomalies, whereas disorders with adolescent aged onset i.e. anxiety, show developmental differences in the frontal regions. It can be speculated that the PFC\u2019s immaturity in adolescents relative to adults, may be sensitive to the reawakening and prolonged effects of the HPA axis. However, brain development is not the only factor giving rise to psychopathologies in adolescents with mental health varying by person. Instead some researchers propose the stress-diathesis model, suggesting an interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental stresses, predisposing certain individuals to psychopathologies during adolescence (Spear, 2010).", "positive": "hink you would benefit from a spray tan<new>Can I try do it<new><pers1_FN> is so jokes bc you could literally walk in on her and <pers2_NN> shagging abs she would deny it \ud83d\ude02<new>\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<new>I actually don\u2019t know<new>I can\u2019t sleep at the moment<new>Just think of bare random shit<new>I keep having dreams my teeth are falling out, which apparently represents stress<new>I woke up at like 6<new>Probs a bit later than 6<new>Had a really weird dream I went to meet <pers_FN> to talk abs his mum was there and she bollocked me \ud83d\ude02<new>That is so hanging<new><pers_FN> showers like once a week", "attacked": "Is it worth trying a spray tan?"}

As a paying student, I am not receiving an education worth \u00a39,250 an academic year and have absolutely no safety in my degrees or future. <nl>From the start of the 2020 academic year, we have been limited to online lectures and seminars, many of us without a simple chance at face-to-face lessons in university based on your restrictions. The necessity for debating, critical thinking amongst peers, practical learning, access to science labs and technology, observative learning and several other aspects the learning process a University is supposed to give to its students, has been stripped from us. This lack of access to lectures and university resources is all under the order of your restrictions. With all of this deprived of us, we are still expected to completeproduce the same amount of work, uphold attendance, be graded, and take exams (regardless of learning style, speech, and language needs) in the same way as the previous 2019 students, who had full access to the resources they were paying for. <nl>A -level students, along with GCSE students have been addressed, given direction, and reassured about their exams and future. However, it is the university students who are paying \u00a39,250 an academic year to study, who have not even received acknowledgement from the Prime Minister or the Government regarding the next steps of our education. The government has not even had the decency to address Universities and their students other than to blame them for the spreading of COVID-19. Where is the exam safety net for University students? Most importantly, how will this significantly reduced service offer affect our degrees, our careers, our access to jobs with grades and the job market reflective of a global pandemic. <nl>Many students have paid a minimum of \u00a37000 to live in student accommodation to be able to access their university campus at ease. Nevertheless, the government has restricted us from accessing the same universities we have been enrolled to learn in. On top of this, the government has urged university students to stay in our accommodations during this pandemic in an attempt to lower the spread of the virus, all while allowing millions of primary and secondary school children to attend closed spaces of their school facilities to demonstrate your support of education in the UK. Are university students not in need of education also? <nl>Although many of us are loaning student fees from the government, we will be expected to carry and repay this debt for many years. We are asking you to speak and act on behalf of University students across the UK. We are pleading for a review, reduced fees, and security of our degrees. Many of us who deferred our university place for 2019 had almost no choice but to join university this year, 2020. Many of us are experiencing isolation and a rapid decline in mental health and emotional wellbeing due to this uncertainty, lack of acknowledgement and the expectation that we should just adapt without the expectation of support. As a democratic country, we empower you as citizens and legal voters to speak and act on our behalf. Please call for a review of our academic year due to the 202021 pandemic. We are the future MP\u2019s, nurses, doctors, vets, lawyers etc of the United Kingdom. <nl>A response to this email and addressing of Universities and their students from the Members of Parliament and Prime Minister of this country will help us believe in the future you have promised and are fighting to achieve for us. <nl>Thank you for reading. <nl>Yours faithfully, a University student of 20202021 ", "attacked": "Is it permissible to use the term \"first person plural\" when referring to 'The Sun Says' in a newspaper article?"}

{"anchor": "The question to what extent to which English Laws general hostility towards good faith in commercial contracts is justifiable within the modern day has been subjected to disapproval by some judges. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd Bingham L.J. noted that \u2018in many legal systems outside the common law world, the law of obligations recognises and enforces an overriding principle that in making and carrying out contracts parties should act in good faith\u2019 but English law has decided not to adopt a good faith obligation but rather \u2018developed piecemeal solutions in response to demonstrated problems of unfairness.\u2019 The courts in England are more concerned with commercial certainty rather than parties being just towards one another. <nl><nl>This essay will argue that the hostility towards good faith obligations within commercial contracts cannot be justified in the modern day and that there should be a good faith principle introduced in English Law. It will begin by discussing the current law in relation to good faith and explain how an overriding principle of good faith will be beneficial to the parties in commercial contracts. It will then suggest the reasons why in this day and age it is important for there to be an obligation of good faith within commercial contracts and give examples of the English law\u2019s current recognition of implied and express good faith obligations. Finally, it will look at the general principles of the UK courts such as party autonomy and commercial certainty and explore how they can still be preserved with an obligation of good faith. <nl><nl>Good faith is the notion that those within contracts will act fairly towards one another. They will \u2018put all their cards face upwards on the table\u2019 and trade in a way that is open and fair.<nl>Traditionally good faith is not an overriding principle in English Law as the courts prefer for there to be certainty within commercial contracts as opposed to fairness. They are particularly against imposing broad good faith obligations. The reasons for this include the fact that it can cause uncertainty because if there was an obligation to act in good faith this can sometimes go against what the terms of the contract include. The parties can usually only go to court if one party does not fulfil their end of the contract. Furthermore, good faith can be seen as subjective as every person will have a different view of what good faith is and sometimes one judge may go too far and start siding with one party which would cause the other party a loss and so it would be difficult to find a middle point where it is suitable for both parties to not be at a complete loss. Another reason as to why the English courts prefer not to have a good faith obligation is because it makes them a lot more attractive to global businesses since they are one of the main countries without a good faith obligation. This allows for those wanting to get into commercial contracts to be more certain about the outcomes if anything was to go wrong. English law also prefers for there to be party autonomy as it allows both parties to be able to choose which law will govern their contract.  This allows for an enhanced level of certainty and predictability because both parties will be able to choose which laws best suit them. The parties also have freedom of contract which gives each party the freedom to enter into a contract and decide what terms to include. <nl><nl>Rather than an actual good faith principal English law prefers to adopt piecemeal solutions which are used for certain situations where it is seen as necessary. These will usually arise in fiduciary relationships, contracts of insurance and contracts of partnerships and employment. These include contractual interpretation where the courts will look at the intention of the parties rather than a strict interpretation of the words used in the contract.  Another instance where the courts might decide to use piecemeal solutions is when an unfair act amounts to promissory estoppel. Misrepresentation is another example where the courts might use piecemeal solutions. In some contracts such as ones where fiduciary duties are assumed there is a duty to consider the other party\u2019s interests. The party assuming the fiduciary duties will be obligated to not act dishonestly and cannot allow their interests to clash with those of their principle.  <nl><nl>Within the terms of a contract a party is allowed to include an express term to act or negotiate in good faith. This will mean both parties will have to act and negotiate in good faith and the courts will uphold this term as it is written in the contract if it is breached by either party. In Berkeley Community Villages Ltd v Pullen, it was held that an agreement would be enough to create a contractual obligation for the parties to act in good faith. This approach was also used in CPC Group Ltd v Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co by Vos J. who stated that \u2018the obligation of utmost good faith in the [contract]was to adhere to the spirit of the contract \u2026. And to observe reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, in the shortest possible time, and to be faithful to the agreed common purpose, and to act consistently with the justified expectations of the parties.\u2019 There is an increased amount of recognition for express terms to act in good faith in commercial contracts and many judges will uphold the term because their concern is ensuring the terms of the contract are not breached. This means that if a party wants a good faith obligation in their contract then they just have to include one as a term of the contract but if the other party does not want a goof faith obligation imposed on them then it can cause some issues for the parties as it could be assumed that the other party may not have the intention to act fairly and that is the reason why they don\u2019t want a good faith obligation in the contract. However, if there was a good faith obligation then this would ensure that both the parties have to act fairly towards one another which would almost eliminate the party\u2019s having bad intentions entering the contract as they know if they act upon their bad intentions then they will have to face the consequences in court. In the past there has been attempts by judges to introduce a good faith principle that extends to all contracts. In 1766 Lord Mansfield declared that \u2018[t]he governing principle is applicable to all contracts and dealings. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain, from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. But either party may be innocently silent, as to grounds open to both, to exercise their judgment upon.\u2019 However this outlook did not last long as the courts favoured party autonomy and sanctity of contract more.  It is useful for parties to have an express term to act in good faith in their contract as it would allow them to resolve a problem that might happen in the future using a good faith mechanism rather than use an expensive third-party tool. Having an express term to negotiate or act in good faith will allow parties to plan ahead in the event of an uncontrollable event happening such as the market crashing or an economic recession. In the event this does happen the parties will be able to discuss how they can continue to keep working with each other and how they will uphold their side of the agreement. It is becoming very common to find good faith clauses within contracts in the modern day which suggests that many people want to trade in good faith and would not be opposed to a good faith obligation as a lot of those in commercial contracts have willingly decided to include a good faith clause in their contracts. <nl><nl>Good faith may sometimes be implied by law in certain contracts as a term that must be followed. It is often needed in order for the contract to run smoothly. It is not implied based upon the intentions of the parties, rather because of the contractual relationship between the two parties.The different types of contracts it can be implied in include employment contracts, contracts of sale and goodwill as well as partnerships and contracts with fiduciary duties. Another way good faith can be implied is through fact. This is done to give importance to the intention of the parties in the contract. It is often implied based on necessity and obviousness. The case of Yam Seng Pte v International Trade Corp Ltd was significant in discussing whether there was an implied obligation that both parties will act in good faith with each other. Lord Leggart J. had agreed that the terms in the contract were enough to imply good faith and he also argued in favour of \u2018the implication of a term requiring good faith in performance\u2019 not only in just relational contracts but most commercial contracts based on the expectations of both parties. The fact that English law already has many instances where it uses pockets of good faith proves that a good faith principle would prove to be useful for parties entering into a contract as it is already used in several types of contracts and contractual relations. Many other countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Australia have a good faith principle in place which means that it is possible for the United Kingdom to have one too without the worry of wondering how they will execute such a principle. Although, the English courts might argue that having an obligation of good faith will take away from the party\u2019s freedom of contract and party autonomy, this can be disputed with the fact that the Canadian Supreme Court has said \u2018the principle of good faith must be applied in a manner that is consistent with the fundamental commitments of the common law of contract which generally places great weight on the freedom of contracting parties to pursue their individual self-interest.\u2019 The English courts can follow a similar approach and apply the principle in a way that will still allow those in commercial contracts their contractual freedom whilst also ensuring that they deal in a way that is honest, fair and truthful to the other party. <nl><nl>The introduction of a good faith obligation will allow parties to feel more reassured that if the other party was to act in bad faith towards them, then they will at least have support from the courts. The party who acted in bad faith would be required to give compensation to the other party in order to correct their wrongdoings. The English courts are already accepting of a good faith clause within contracts and also state that there is a duty to act in good faith in certain types of relationships. This suggests that they may be open to the idea of introducing a legally binding principle of good faith. The law has developed in regard to express terms to negotiate in good faith since the case of Walford v Miles where the House of Lords had stated that promises to negotiate or not sell were unenforceable and rejected that the opposing party were under an obligation to act in good faith. Lord Acknew has stated that \u2018a bare agreement to negotiate was not enforceable, as it lacked the necessary certainty.  It was no more than an (unenforceable) \u2018agreement to agree\u2019. However, in Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras it was held that if there was an express term to negotiate in good faith then it is enforceable. Whilst Longmore LJ had expressed that there were three objections to negotiate in good faith, he also stated that these objections did not completely prevent enforceability. He claimed that the first objection had carried little weight because normally the express obligation would have been enforceable. The second objection would be difficult to determine as it is unlikely the courts will be able to decide when the breach of the term had amounted to good faith and unless fraud was involved then it is likely the court would not consider the other party had acted in bad faith. In regard to the third objection Longmore LJ stated it would be difficult to find out exactly how much loss had occurred as a result of the breach. The development in the law after both of these cases suggests that judges are more accepting of good faith clauses and they are not seen as unenforceable \u2018agreements to agree\u2019. The general view of judges in recent times agree with Longmore LJ and believe it would be \u2018quite wrong\u2019 for the courts to deem an express clause to negotiate in good faith as unenforceable. <nl><nl>It can be argued that introducing a good faith principle will undermine party autonomy and freedom of contract, but this can be easily resolved by using a method of enforcement similar to Canada when it comes to good faith. If the English courts enforce good faith, then they should limit the amount they get involved in order to preserve the freedom of parties. If the courts introduce a good faith clause then it should be \u2018capable of being given legal content\u2019. A good faith obligation would lead to fair dealing and less attempts of people acting in bad faith towards others. It would allow for more trust between parties as they will have more hope that it is unlikely the other party will act unfairly and unjustly towards them. <nl><nl>In conclusion there should be a good faith principle introduced in English law as it will reassure those entering commercial contracts that if they were to enter a contract then the other party will have to act towards them in good faith and trade fairly with them. Parties can also be reassured that the courts would help them if the other party acted in bad faith towards them. There is also an increase in the amount of people in commercial contracts including clauses to act or negotiate in good faith towards one another. This proves that many people are going out of their way to include these clauses as it can be seen as a form of protection. Many international courts have a good faith obligation in place, and it does not take away from the freedom parties have, rather it enhances their security and lessens the chances of them being scammed. This is because the other party will less likely want to act in bad faith if they know the implications of their actions if taken to court. Whilst it is likely the courts will have some reservations or concerns towards a good faith obligation; they can look at how international courts implement the obligation. This will help them to keep a balance between doing too much or too little whilst maintaining the general principles of English commercial law.", "positive": "<nl>I would like to inquire about some <job_title> work with <pers_FN>.<new>Hello I am looking for a job in your <city> branch and have attached my CV.

{"anchor": "Rationale:<nl>The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today\u2019s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual\u2019s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual\u2019s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><nl>Discourse 1- negativity of social media<nl>Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl> <nl>Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. <nl><nl>Discourse 2- vital for families<nl>Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. <nl><nl>Discourse 3- loneliness <nl>Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely.<nl><nl>Discourse 4- social media not healthy<nl>Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved.<nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely.<nl>Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling. The wrong way to do it is by lying or exaggerating on social media just to acquire a specific response or reaction from the people reading it.", "positive": "<addr4_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you so much for clarifying task 4, I appreciate the help.

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. <nl>Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. <nl>Evaluation of market segment<nl>With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this \u2018Under 22\u2019 bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 \u2013 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher\u2019s fairs should focus on the \u2018Under 22\u2019 package as this is most relevant to first year students.<nl><nl><nl>Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city.<nl>This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success.<nl>Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel.<nl><nl>Positioning<nl>As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost.<nl>To identify Car Club\u2019s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. <nl>Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers\u2019 initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people.<nl><figure><nl>If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of \u00a33.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around \u00a32.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It\u2019s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. <nl>Sixt and Avis start at \u00a351 (Sixt 2020) and \u00a360 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of \u00a336day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs.<nl>The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club\u2019s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility.<nl>In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success.<nl><figure><nl>Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team!<nl>The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club\u2019s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category.<nl><nl>Car Club\u2019s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so.<nl>From Car Club\u2019s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham.<nl><figure><nl>Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives.<nl><nl>Campaign Objectives<nl>1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population)<nl>As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham\u2019s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher\u2019s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club\u2019s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention.<nl><nl>2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher\u2019s fairs within the city<nl>Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users\u2019 involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. <nl><nl>Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools<nl>The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming.<nl>Push strategy \u2013 Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student\u2019s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise\u2019s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors.<nl><nl>Pull strategy \u2013 This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers\u2019 minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness.<nl>As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers\u2019 positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion.<nl><nl>Marketing tools plan<nl>Personal selling<nl>Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication \u2026 in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy \u2026 a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers\u2019 presence on campus at  fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club\u2019s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. <nl><nl>Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use.<nl>Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise\u2019s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. <nl>Testing<nl>Personal sellers\u2019 ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher\u2019s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the  venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data.<nl>Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments.<nl><nl>Advertising<nl>Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication \u2026 designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS\u2019 lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that  \"77%\u00a0of students are using Instagram, and\u00a075%\u00a0are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club\u2019s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students\u2019 social-media usage whilst remaining affordable.<nl>Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness.<nl><nl>Integration of marketing communications <nl>Enterprise\u2019s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 as they are socially active \u2018communaholics\u2019, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide.<nl>Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company\u2019s market position and standing by Enterprise\u2019s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service.<nl>The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online.<nl><nl>Implementation plan<nl>Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April \u2013 Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops.<nl>Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn\u2019t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "positive": "ave also been offering to buy everyone a pint for that \u00a31 so its a good investment;)<new>Voting should be live here in 45 mins <link><new>Of course;) haha I love that, well wherever it is Im sure it will be class\ud83d\ude02<new>Ah they have since closed the \u00a31 voting because its unfair apparently so thank you but I dont think itll even let you vote now\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d<new>Thats good to hear!

{"anchor": "<question1><nl><nl>ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition, characterised by the co-occurrence of impairments in social interaction, communication development and restrictedrepetitive behaviours (RRBs) (Bakhtiari et al (2012). Advances in brain scanning techniques seen in the past two decades (such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), has provided a unique opportunity to assess brain connectivity and how differences relative to the neurotypical brain, may contribute to the profile of behaviours seen in ASD.<nl><nl>Underconnectivity theory hypothesises that ASD and its characteristic deficits is caused as a direct result of under functioning in integrative circuitry, that results in an impairment of information integration at neuralcognitive levels (Just et al., 2004).  Just et al (2004) tested this hypothesis, using 17 high functioning ASD individuals compared with typically developing (TD) matched controls, paired on the basis of verbal IQ. All participants completed a sentence comprehension task whilst in an fMRI scanner, assessing functional connectivity between the language areas of the brain. It was found that ASD individuals showed a large systematic difference in distribution of brain activity relative to TD controls, with posterior left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke\u2019s area) activation being greater in ASD and left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca\u2019s area) activation greater in control participants. Furthermore, it was seen that functional connectivity between the language areas in ASD was lower throughout the cortical language systems in comparison to controls. Just et al (2004) suggests these findings have implications for the behaviours seen in ASD, namely atypical strengths in processing single words but deficits in interpreting complex sentences and stories. This may in turn account for the difficulties seen in ASD when interpreting homographs (Happ\u00e9, 2011). It is speculated that this underconnectivity between cortical regions applies to other higher-level functions. Research assessing theory of mind (ToM), specifically mentalising, in ASD individuals supports this (Castelli et al., 2002). Castelli et al (2002) found that individuals with ASD were less accurate and offered less interpretations during a mental state attribution task relative to controls and that this correlated with reduced activation in the brain\u2019s mentalising network. Despite support from other literature, caution should be taken when interpreting Just et al\u2019s (2004) findings because of its low external validity. Only a small sample size was used, including only high functioning Caucasian individuals, meaning it cannot capture and account for the broad spectrum of ASD and the wider population. <nl>White matter (WM) is key for efficient and synchronised communication between brain regions, underpinning the foundation of brain connectivity (Dean et al., 2016). Research suggests atypical WM microstructure may account for the deficits seen in ASD. Bakhtiari et al (2012) assessed this in ASD participants compared to neurotypical (NT) individuals using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). It was found that ASD participants showed decreased fractional anisotropy values (FA), bilaterally spanning over a large brain region relative to controls, telling of maldevelopment in WM. These decreased FA values in ASD individuals correlated with social and communication difficulties, assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Regions displaying decreased FA in WM tracts included those implicated in emotional face processing (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus), language (inferior longitudinal fasciculus) and executive function (inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, which is linked to attention). A limitation of Bakhtiari et al\u2019s (2012) study is that participants were not screened for other neurological conditions i.e. schizophrenia and ADHD which have also been identified as showing abnormalities in WM, namely low FA relative to controls (Davenport et al., 2010). Furthermore, Bakhtiari et al\u2019s findings do not account for RRBs seen in ASD, with research suggesting an association between high FA values and RRBs (Cheung et al., 2009). This shows that the picture surrounding WM and the ASD behaviours is not completely clear yet and future research should seek to address this.<nl>To conclude abnormal brain connectivity appears to play an integral role in the profile of behaviours and differences in cognitive function seen in those with ASD. Underconnectivity theory arguably provides a robust account of language as well as ToM deficits seen in ASD (Just et al., 2004; Castelli et al., 2002). Meanwhile low FA values, indicative of WM disruption in ASD, can account for impairments in social and communication domains (Just et al., 2004). As mentioned above, DTI literature has also shown increased FA values corelating with RRBs seen in ASD (Cheung et al.,2009).  Some researchers suggest atypical brain connectivity underpins the differences seen in ASD, going as far as to suggest it is the first firm finding in ASD research (see Hughes, 2007).<nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogenous neurological disorder, defined and diagnosed by the co-occurrence of impairments in communication, social interaction and the existence of restrictedrepetitive behaviours and interests in an individual (Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015). Some researchers suggest that ASD is a fractionable disorder (Happ\u00e9 et al., 2006). Those in support of fractionation argue that there is no single cause for the symptomology seen in ASD and it may be speculated that this is contributing to the \u2018lost generation\u2019 of ASD individuals (see Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015) whose needs may not be being met (Happ\u00e9, 2006). Evidence in support of fractionation theory, largely comes from research into the broader autism phenotype (BAP), defined as subclinical level of ASD symptoms within the general population, that exist outside of the threshold for an ASD diagnosis (Sasson et al., 2013). <nl><nl>ASD is as a highly heritable disorder with estimates as high as 90% (Losh et al., 2009). This genetic liability has been shown by family research to translate in unaffected relatives of ASD individuals as milder, subclinical expressions of the triad, identifiable as the BAP (Losh et al., 2009). Losh et al\u2019s (2009) assessed the BAP in the parents of ASD diagnosed individuals (n=83) using a battery of well-established tasks, measuring ASD symptoms across the triad. <nl>Losh et al (2009) found that of the ASD parents, 22 were identified as positive for social BAP characteristics and 34 identified as positive for rigidperfectionist BAP characteristics. Parents demonstrating social BAP performed significantly less accurately relative to controls on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and similar results were observed across all 6 social cognition measures. However, this was not seen as plainly for tasks assessing executive function and central coherence. This demonstrates the validity of the BAP in parents of ASD individuals and suggest its componential nature, supporting the fractionation of the triad of impairments. However, Losh et al\u2019s research did not control for other disorders such as schizophrenia, which has been proven to have phenotypic similarities to ASD, that also impair social cognition (Sasson et al., 2007). Research seeking to replicate this study should pre-screen for such disorders that could affect ability in tasks, to confirm finding specificity to ASD.<nl><nl><nl>Low to moderate inter-corelations between the triad domains of impairment in ASD individuals has been outlined by researchers as evidence in favour of the fractionation theory (Happ\u00e9 et al., 2006). Conversely, Murray et al (2014) suggests this may be a product of range restriction, underestimating the inter-corelation between traits in those diagnosed. It is argued that studies use of clinical samples represents only the extremes of ASD symptoms because of simultaneous selection in diagnosis, therefore attenuating trait variance and its corelation with other variables. Testing this Murray et al (2014) used a simulation study of 10,000,000 cases showing impairments in all 3 domains, to replicate diagnosis and compared this with real population data from 236 non ASD participants and 148 participants diagnosed with high functioning ASD or Asperger\u2019s. Results showed significantly low inter-corelations between triad domains in the simulation study compared to the population study corelation. It was argued that this demonstrates the attenuation of inter-correlations between traits when simultaneous selection occurs. Murray suggest that investigations of ASD symptom inter-corelations should use both clinical samples and non-diagnosed participants, if we are to assume the characteristic of ASD exist on a continuum within the general population. This conversely suggests that using the general population can serve to facilitate the argument that ASD is a coherent, non-fractionable disorder. With this being said, the use of a simulation to reflect the ASD diagnosis process lacks ecological validity and cannot fully capture the character of the selection process in diagnosis, meaning cautions should be taken when drawing conclusions. Furthermore, this study is not reflective of the broad spectrum of ASD as only high-functioning individuals were sampled meaning it cannot account for low-functioning individuals. <nl><nl><nl>To conclude the BAP has been influential in identifying the genetic basis of ASD with a wealth of family-based research supporting this claim (Losh et al., 2009; Constantino &amp; Todd, 2005). However, it remains the case that no single gene can account for all aspects of triad, implying that they may be instead be symptom specific (Happ\u00e9 et al., 2006). Research with the general population and those displaying the BAP can also be used in support of ASD being a coherent disorder as suggested by Murray et al (2014). Future research should aim to control for simultaneous, clarifying triad symptom correlations.", "positive": "e you x<new>That\u2019s good to know<new>I will have a look<new>xx<new>Ooh lovely!!! \ud83d\ude0d<new>What\u2019s his name<new>his hands are massive \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<new>In my purse the whole time<new>I like it but it\u2019s completely up to you!!

You could also visit the Heureka souvenir shop on Urho Kekkosen Katu 1, 00100 if you wanted to bring anything back with you after your trip. Finally, I would suggest you visit the Koko Jazz club for some live music in the evenings, this will be on Hameentie 3, 00530. Let me know if this works for you and if you would like me to continue with more research on the area All the best, Luke", "positive": "a yes exactly! No one here wants it.

{"anchor": "This strategy paper will focus on suggesting realistic solutions to the problem of educational gender inequality in India. This inequality is a clear problem; unequal access to education is an infringement of human rights. If this gender disparity was lessened, the well-being and development of children would be positively impacted, as well as the economy of the country itself (Fuller, 2019). To tackle this issue, proposed strategies could take the form of implementing new legislative reforms that aid families in the struggles they face, as well as reforming teaching throughout India in order to help eradicate damaging cultural and social norms. The paper will begin by firstly explaining the main problems within the education sector in India and will then highlight the importance of achieving gender equality in education. The main body of the paper will entail a detailed analysis of the current strategies and legislation in place as well as non-governmental reforms made by different organisations. The paper will then move towards a focus on the suggested strategies that could be incorporated into the current education system to alleviate gender inequalities and will be compared to the successes of educational reform in Sweden. This will include a description of the targets for the reforms, instruments to aid reform, and the target groups at which reforms are aimed at. The paper will conclude with a summary of the findings from this research and ways to ensure the successful implementation of new strategies.  <nl>Why is this a problem?<nl>There are two primary factors that can limit the education of girls in India: cultural traditions and poverty. In terms of cultural traditions, there are several reasons that this issue can play a significant role in the educational disparity between genders. Firstly, the miseducation of parents about the importance of schools for girls and the costings of education itself thus leads to families becoming reluctant to educate girls within the household. Research shows that parents are more willing to send their girls to school if they had access to more information about school (Maertens, 2011). Furthermore, it is said that gender discrimination within household expenditure and education has resulted in the inadequate progress of educating of women in many countries across the world, and thus ingrains this issue into the societal framework of such countries (Saha, 2013). This is also reinforced by the low literacy rates in India. The correlation between low literacy rates among men and women indicates that the miseducation of parents can affect the education of girls because they themselves have had inadequate education, and it is difficult for them to understand the importance of it, further highlighting the gender inequalities between men and women through previous social norms. For example, the 2011 literacy rates of women were 57.93% compared to men which were 77.15% (Pathania, 2020) demonstrating gender disparities and how poverty can be a factor in gender inequalities within education. Poverty plays an important role in the lack of education for girls. Daughters from families that face social pressures to get married are more likely to only complete minimum education, as shown in a study of three rural villages in India, where only 39% of girls were allowed by their parents to pursue higher education, compared to the 71% of boys who would go into further education (Maertens, 2013). Furthermore, educating women is not prioritised in the household as it stops the income that would otherwise be earned from girls going straight into work rather than staying in school. Therefore, working and earning can be seen to be put on a pedestal instead for the many families facing financial difficulties (Hebert, 2020).<nl>Why is this an important issue for gender equality?<nl>As UNICEF has stated, the educational advancement of girls is the most effective way of combatting challenges to human development, so it is important to expand educational access and overcome cultural norms to achieve this (Ross, Shah &amp; Wang, 2011). Inequalities within education are important to the issue of gender equality, as even though India emerges as one of the top three countries for higher education (Bazaz &amp; Akram, 2020), in certain states such as Uttar Pradesh, only 33.20% of women are educated compared to the 73.40% of men who are educated, highlighting that there are severe problems within the education system that disadvantage women. Furthermore, this can lead to other problems such as a gender gap in the labour market, as if employers value a woman\u2019s education less than that of a man\u2019s, and therefore there are fewer economic incentives to educate women, which subsequently affects the economy and the wellbeing of women (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Another factor that makes this issue important is that the education of girls further reduces the risks they face, such as abuse and child marriage, as currently, a third of child brides worldwide are in India (Sahni, 2018). Moreover, better education for girls reduces the risks of child labour in poorer families to ensure the survival of their households, as the hourly wages of a child with higher school education are 8.97% higher compared to a child with no schooling, leading to less exploitation (Chamarbagwala, 2008). <nl>Attempted strategies to achieve gender equality in education<nl>There have been many attempts in India to close the gender gaps in education, through both legal and social means. The main legislative reform introduced was the Right to Education Act in 2009, in which, all children between 6 and 14 years of age are required to complete primary school education. This reform has proven successful as enrolment between 2013-14 increased from 43.8% to 48.2% (Sahni, 2018). However, its success still proves limited on the gender equality front as a UNESCO report detailed that of the 95% of children who attended primary school, only 40% continued onto secondary education, in which, a small fraction of the 40% were girls (Modi, 2017). Attempts have also been made to reform the curriculum. However, this failed due to the response of disadvantaged schools towards the issue of gender equality: an attempt was made to create a new system where boys of different abilities were paired with girls, but this meant the educational interests of girls were sacrificed, therefore showing little to no development in changing gender inequalities in schools (Charlton, 2007).<nl>Secondly, a non-legislative reform that was made to combat gender inequality in education was the KGBV programme introduced in 2004. The goal of the programme was to increase children\u2019s, and in particular girls, access to the curriculum and to improve teaching standards. This began successfully as two Indian states partnered with CARE India (a non-governmental organisation) to introduce KGBV schools that were single-sex and employ a non-traditional curriculum. The KGBV school initiative was shown to be successful as they were more inclusive than state schools, as children of all castes could attend, which also allowed the new schools challenged harmful social norms. However, the success was limited as the KGBV programme did not focus on education above seventh grade where school dropout rates for girls are the highest (Shah, 2015).<nl>Finally, the most successful attempt at improving gender inequality in education was by ANK, a non-profit organisation with an aim to empower girls. ANK set up in 10 rural villages and introduced several initiatives for girls including: bicycle banks in 2002 to improve access to schools for girls, a life skills education programme out of school hours, a scholarship programme, and a karate programme. The implementation of these programmes showed great promise as 1,100 girls achieved a scholarship and 1,000 girls were given access to bikes. It was found that the combination of the bicycle bank and the life skills education programme led to the best education outcomes for girls. However, the bicycle bank programme was discontinued and this programme only reached a small number of girls, so, nationally, gender disparities remained high (Modi, 2017).<nl>Proposed Strategies<nl>My first proposed strategy is to subsidise costs for school by 50% for low-income families; as mentioned above, many parents selectively choose their male children to attend school rather than their female children, because of financial difficulties. Therefore, subsidising the costs of schooling can enable equal opportunities for girls. This has proved successful in countries such as Sweden, where pre-schooling costs have been subsidised for lower-income families, in order to equalise opportunities for all and ensure substantial educational attainment for both males and females (Bjorklund, Clark, Edin, Fredricksson &amp; Krueger, 2006). Success can be seen clearly when compared to India, a large 79% of the students go on to secondary school in Sweden (European Commission, 2017) against a mere 40% in India, in which, the ratio of boys to girls is equal in Sweden unlike in India (Modi, 2017).<nl>Additionally, another legislative reform that could be introduced is to improve families\u2019 access to daycare and after school care, so that parents can work, alleviating any stresses on children providing additional household income. A similar policy proved successful in Sweden (Sweden, 2020), in which a right to daycare was introduced in the 1990s for working parents to alleviate financial pressure (Fritzell, Hvinden, Kautto, Kvist &amp; Uusitalo, 2001). Furthermore, there has been evidence to suggest that altering the way teachers are trained helps to promote gender equality and eradicate bias in the classroom. In a proposed system called REFLECT, teachers are given criteria that they must meet, including creating a suitable learning environment for female and male children - this could prove beneficial in India (Kollmayer, 2020).<nl>The next proposed strategy is an extension of the work of ANK with the bicycle banks and life skills education programme (Modi, 2017) as it proved successful but stopped due to a lack of funding. This would enable a focus on the education of girls and give them access to adequate teaching, which in turn reaps enormous benefits economically, socially, and mentally, especially in terms of the wellbeing of girls in India. It would also help to elevate the goal of India to become more gender-inclusive, as currently, their progress for gender equality remains slow and they stand at a ranking of 132 out of 187 countries (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Sequentially, to enable parents of girls to realise the importance of education, it is vital to recruit them as allies in the movement against gender inequalities in education. To do this, parents\u2019 evenings could be introduced for teachers to educate parents in schooling and other matters that put girls at risk such as child marriage. Research shows that parents evenings are important in the development of a child and important for the parents themselves as they are responsible for making key decisions that impact the future of their children (Fefer, 2020), highlighting how this can also be a way to communicate the positive prospects for girls with the aid of education. <nl>To conclude, it is prevalent that actions must be taken within education legislation and within the households of girls to combat the problem of gender inequality within education. The government must take steps to support families of lower incomes so as to ensure no one is denied equal opportunity to education. This will reduce child labour rates, increase literacy rates, and improve India\u2019s ranking on the gender equality index, as well as increasing the economic status of many civilians in India. With the increased education of girls, it will help to combat harmful social norms in the future, preventing young girls from the fate of child marriage, abuse, and exploitation. With reforms in teaching, they could allow for long-lasting changes within education, as it means they can be the main drivers for change within schools. This, combined with the added aid of regular parents\u2019 evenings, allows for teachers to become catalysts in changing negative social attitudes towards gender equality concerns that strategies like these will remain only partially effective. For example, India was one of 52 countries that refused to comply with Article 5 of the UN sustainable development goals which states that \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" (United Nations, 2020). Without the support of the government, gender equality may not be valued. However, this can be counteracted by the implementation and enforcement of new laws, starting within the education sector, to allow women and young girls to become more independent and assert themselves within society.", "positive": "nk you \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a see you later!! xxxx<new>hahahaa \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I've got to say that was a good joke<new>Yeah its good you have \"gone into work\" but also realise when you need a break too as I can imagine it must be really mentally draining for you.

{"anchor": "This essay will look to answer the question above, \u2018To what extent does sport foster and reproduce a hyper-consumerist culture?\u2019. Hyper-consumerism refers to \u2018the consumption of goods for non-functional purposes and the associated significant pressure to consume those goods, exerted by modern capitalist society, as those goods shape one\u2019s identity\u2019 (Wikipedia, 2020), in simpler forms, \u2018a consumerism for the sake of consuming\u2019 (Lunning, F., 2014). There are a number of ways that the theory of hyper-consumerism can be applied to the subject of sport and sports relation to hyper-consumerism. However, there are a number of ways that sport can be considered as not fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism and instead an area affected by hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>There are a number of highly popular professional sports that over the last 3 decades have seen the change of consumerism within the professional sport. Hyper-consumerism in a number of professional sports. One professional sport where there has been an abundance of growth in consumerism and profitability is professional football. The Premier League teams of England are projected to pull in \u00a35.4bn in the 202021 season (Deloitte, 2020). With \u00a31.35bn (25%) of this coming from commercial business for the Premier League clubs. The Premier League generates the most revenue out of all the top 5 European football leagues by roughly \u00a31.5bn over the closest league, Spain at \u00a33.38bn. The scale of these figures show the high expenditure within football leagues but especially the Premier League. It also shows the size of the commercial brands of the Premier League teams. Specifically the annual revenue of the big 6 Premier League teams totalling \u00a34.13bn (Sports Pro Media, 2020). This revenue causes high expenditure on transfers and wages for players. This lavish spending fosters a lifestyle that is presented to fans and these fans want to be a part of whether its buying a jersey of the team they support or buying a season ticket to watch their team every weekend. These actions are a perfect example of hyper-consumerism culture with these goods being non-functional and possess a significant pressure in the supporters life and take control of their lives when the games are being played. <nl><nl>Although hyper-consumerism does play a role within sports, as presented above, however, is the growth of revenues within football fostered by hyper-consumerism not the other way round? Hyper-consumerism is a theory that has been around longer than the growth in revenues for sports with its close association with globalisation and cultural homogenisation (McGregor, S., 2007). With this considered if there was a lack of globalisation and cultural homogenisation would we see the high revenue of the top global sporting leagues such as  the NFL, NBA, MLB and the Premier League, which all are valued between \u00a35bn and \u00a311bn (AP Sports Editor, 2020). Without the human nature of greed that causes hyper-consumerism would we instead see these leagues having significantly lower revenue. This is just one factor that could suggest in my opinion that hyper-consumerism fosters sports and the growth of sports. It can also be considered that hyper-consumerism and sports are actually symbiotic, in which they work in a close relationship as one grows the other grows and vice-versa. <nl> <nl>Another factor that supports the idea of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism is that of the growing expenditure of households on sports. According to a study by Sheffield Hallam University, the average household expenditure on sports in 2002 was \u00a311.38, however, as of 2018 the average household expenditure on sports was \u00a376.80 (Gov.uk, 2019).  This is a 674% increase in expenditure over 16 years or 42% per year. This tremendous growth in expenditure is similar to the growth in revenue of the most popular UK sporting league, the Premier League, which over 16 years saw its revenues grow from \u00a31.25bn (Deloitte, 2003) to \u00a35.4bn, a growth of 432% or 27% . This shows as a professional sport league grows so does the expenditure by a household. Thus showing evidence of how sport can reproduce and foster a hyper-consumerism culture which is clearly evident in the UK. This culture has significantly grown in the UK over the last two decades and I will look at further into this essay. <nl><nl>Although there is evidence of hyper-consumerism having a relationship to sport, there is also evidence of hyper-consumerism being caused by the growth of technology. A prime example of this is the hyper-consumerism of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has seen a growth of hyper-consumerism with the growth of technology within the country\u2019s economy (Kazim, A., 2018). With an abundance of mega malls and the growth of internet shopping the culture in UAE over the last 50 years has transferred from traditional markets to a hyper-consumer culture of luxury global brands. The growth in this culture in the UAE is seen further with the growth of the country\u2019s GDP per capita which, as of 2019, totaled $69,900 (Societe Generale, 2019). This is a stark contrast to 1975 when the GDP per capita was at $26,847 (World Bank, 2019). These statistics suggest a substantial growth in the economy which has come with a growth in consumerism. This suggests the theory that the main cause of hyper-consumerism is the growth of an economy. Further evidence of this is the lack of sport participation in the UAE this hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. Reinforcing that instead of the sports being played fostering hyper-consumerism instead its the growth of globalisation and technology fostering hyper-consumerism. Ultimately, this shows that hyper-consumerism can exist without a large presence of sport within the economy. <nl><nl>This hyper-consumerist culture that has been seen in the United Arab Emirates is prominently the whole world over. However, there is clear and specific sport  that can be given as evidence for fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. One such sport is basketball and specifically the NBA (National Basketball Association). A prime example within the sport is the Air Jordan brand, owned by Nike and named after the critically acclaimed greatest player of all time, Michael Jordan. The Air Jordan brand, launched in 1984, in 2019, had revenues totalling $3.1 billion which made up 8% of Nike\u2019s revenues in the same year (Forbes, 2020). This along with the revenue of the NBA itself of $8.4 billion shows the massively consumer nature of the NBA in the US (ESPN, 2020). Within the NBA the most popular consumer good is team jerseys, the average price of these is $110, approx. \u00a381 (The Street, 2020). This high priced consumer good along with the cost of attending an NBA game of roughly $89. This fits perfectly the nature of goods that are typical of a hyper-consumerist culture described in the introduction. These goods are not something that is functional but people want and purchase for their lives to fit in with the culture. <nl><nl>Hyper-consumerism is caused by a number of economic factors and the sports economic growth is instead down to the existence of hyper-consumerism. An economic factor is globalisation, with the growing number of accessible non-functional goods hyper-consumerism has become a causal byproduct. This can be seen in sports as seen above with the English Premier League growing to revenues of \u00a35.4bn in 2020. With the league being watched globally in 188 of 193 countries (Premier League, 2019). Without globalisation there would not be abundant accessibility of sports to consumers. With the growth of commercial sports media on the internet in places such as Youtube, with 79% of users watching sports on the platform (Youtube, 2020). Globalisation of markets has caused  hyper-consumerism and greater accessibility to sports that would not be possible without globalisation. . <nl><nl>Previously I have discussed the growing sporting culture and spectator sports in the UK and its role in fostering hyperconsumerism. This is an area that has seen significant growth and can be used as evidence. On the subject of spectator sports, on average in the UK expenditure by spectators is \u00a354 per person (not including ticket price) (Sports England, 2019). This shows sports fostering hyper-consumerism as when attending these events spectators are spending money for non-functional purposes. Furthermore, the UK sporting goods market is expected to have grown by 3.5% in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic (Ibis World, 2020) . Largely caused by the increase of people exercising during the national lockdowns ordered by the UK Government. This being reinforced by the statistics, from Sport England, that 63% of people saying that they exercise over 3 days a week in the first National Lockdown. This shows that even in a time of economic negativity with the UK economy shrinking by 3.4% (PWC, 2020) there was still significant consumer spending on sport showing the level of consumers wants and needs to spend on the non-functional goods or services. This growth in the market even in the pandemic is far greater than other non-functional goods in this time and show the nature of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>Throughout this essay I have compared aspects in which that sport both does foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism but also doesn\u2019t. The aspects that sport shows to foster and reproduce is through the growth of popular leagues such as the English Premier League and these top leagues promoting a lifestyle, the growing of UK household expenditure on watching professional sports, sporting good brands promoted through professional sports such as the NBA and the Air Jordan brand, expenditure on attending spectator sports and purchases at these events. All these aspects promote a clear message that sports play a role in hyper-consumerism at the bare minimum. Whether sport \u2018fosters and reproduces\u2019 hyper-consumerism is highly contestable. Shown by the evidence presented hyper-consumerism can exist and grow without an overarching presence of sport, as seen with the UAE in which the average GDP per capita has grown from $26,847 in 1975 to $69,900 in 2019. This staggering growth in GDP per capita has caused a growth in the consumerist culture which is highly focused on luxury consumer brands. This hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. In conclusion, I think that, firstly, sport can foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism. However, I believe that hyper-consumerism does not need sports to grow as shown with the case of the United Arab Emirates, although this is a rarity and to fully determine how common of an occurrence this can be further research needs to be done. Finally, although sport does foster hyper-consumerism it is only possible with globalisation and instead globalisation is the major foster and reproducer of hyper-consumerism and sports is an area that is consumed by the hyper-consumerist culture we have.

Close to the hotel is a cafe called Moko Market cafe &amp; store Punavuori which will give you a great variety of breakfast options and also happens to be closest to the seaside so you can enjoy a great view while having breakfast. This will roughly be a 4 minute drive from the hotel. 7 Minutes away from the hotel is an interesting museum called Paivalehti newspaper museum which had great reviews and will teach you a lot about Helsinki. Close to the hotel is a restaurant called Mekong Ravintola which is a 3 minute drive from the hotel, serves great food and is highly rated. The restaurant has a variety of foods so you will not have to worry about having issues with seafood. A great gift shop which is nearby is shop Helsinki Mikebon which is a souvenir shop that will have many items to choose from for your children. And lastly as you requested for a night out to enjoy, there is a great entertainment place called Storyville which is a jazz club.

{"anchor": "Wasons selection task was influenced by how hypothesis testing should use the hypo deductive method. He invented 3 problems, including the Selection task.  The selection task is a principal tool people use to find out whether their general statements are true. The abstract version includes 4 cards (a latter on one side and a number in the other) followed by conditional rules. However, despite the simplicity, people still tend to find the task difficult. Therefore, success in this task depends on the insight model (Jhonson-Laird &amp; Wason, 1972). The insight model involves 3 levels; During the first level people only focus on cards that confirm the rule. In level 2, people realise that both instances, conforming and falsifying the rule are important and lastly, people realise that the only cards that falsify the rule are important. <nl>However, according to the memory cueing hypotheses, concrete version of this task has been found to be easier than the abstract version, this is due to the content being familiar and dealt with in the past (Griggs &amp; Cox, 1982). Examples of the concrete version include the so-called drinking law problem; Griggs &amp; Cox, 1982. In this problem, the cards were labelled \u2018beer\u2019, \u2018coke\u2019, \u201922 years\u2019 etc. At which, participants were good in selecting the right cards. Further reasonings to explain the facility of this version of the task are the pragmatic reasoning schemas. The idea that people use context-dependent rules of interference. The most important of which, is the permission schema where people tend to perform better when a permission rule is involved.  For example, \u2018if one acts A, then they must first satisfy a condition prior to it in which people did much better than on the traditional selection task.<nl>Similarity, the social contract theory states people tend to perform better when there are implied rules. However, critics about rules of permission and obligation (deontic reasoning).

{"anchor": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs \u00a3157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a caf\u00e9. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a caf\u00e9 to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Caf\u00e9 Kluuvikatu 3, caf\u00e9 which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too.

{"anchor": "Subsequent to losing the 1983 election on a hardline socialist programme, it became clear that a rebranding of the Labour Party was crucial. The term \"New Labour\" was initially coined by Tony Blair at the 1994 Labour Party Conference, inspired by sociologist Anthony Giddens who believed that it was important to find a \"third way\" between Thatcherism and traditional socialism. The question in hand explores the way in which the Labour Party\u2019s place on the political spectrum has changed through the complexities of several policies introduced over the years. In this essay, I will be assessing the extent to which the Labour Party has been redefined from the Blair-era over two decades ago, to Corbynism today. It is worthwhile dealing with the topic at hand as politics is a subject which needs to be continuously adapting to reflect changes in global dynamics, this topic in particular reveals how government policies develop to maintain dialogue and preserve stability in an increasingly fragile and threatened geopolitical system.<nl><nl>Blair\u2019s creation of New Labour attempted to formulate an alternative to traditional social democracy and free-market neo-liberalism in the context of a modern globalised economy. This neo-revisionism advocated a balance of rights and responsibilities, resulting in communitarian liberalism which emphasised that personal autonomy operates within a communal context based on mutual dependence and benefit. As Brown\u2019s government ensured no radical breakaway from New Labour, ideals and principles of the Labour Party remained the same for many years. However, it is important to note that the Labour government\u2019s failures in the early 21st century appear to have fundamentally changed voters\u2019 views on whether Labour can be trusted on the economy, leading to a Conservative victory in the 2010 general election. This is largely significant as throughout the recent years, the Labour Party seems to have adopted more socialist principles, evident in Corbyn\u2019s left-wing agenda. Therefore, I aim to argue that the Labour party has evolved to a large extent over the years due to many successes and failures of the party leaders\u2019 policies.<nl><nl>In this essay I have used a range of books, websites and JSTOR journals. Previously published academic works include New Labour Hard Labour? Restructuring and resistance in the welfare industry by Gerry Mooney and Alex Law, as well as books such as Leadership and the Labour Party by John Gaffney. In these sources, the key concepts are focussing on New Labours\u2019 appeal to the masses and rebranding of the party. These journals and books gave clear statistics taking an innovative approach as well as differing opinions on the main policies which redefined the Labour Party which provided useful insight and information. To gain better understanding of the authors to ensure reliability of my resources I also did some prior research on them. There were many crossovers to other academic disciplines such as economics and history, especially when researching Blair and Brown\u2019s economic policies there were many statistics and economic theory. However, there were also weaknesses in the sources I used such as the author\u2019s personal opinion being a large influence.<nl><nl>After four general election defeats, the Labour Party realised that traditional class-based political ideas and concepts were no longer seen as acceptable by the British electorate. As a result, the New Labour governments aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations, by conserving resources before investing more in key public services. Blair modernised the Labour party to appeal more to middle-class voters by moving away from traditional policies such as nationalisation and emphasising constitutional reform. \u2018Clause IV\u2019 of the party constitution was abandoned, ties with trade unions were loosened and the party moved away from its previously hard-left position. Labour also became more pro-European as the EU adopted policies that protected workers\u2019 rights such as the Social Chapter, and the Third way brought market models to some government-run services and aroused interest across the western world. Labour policies were largely based around the free-market, which was accepted as the best form of wealth creation with further privatisation and reduced corporate taxes to encourage enterprise. Greater emphasis was placed on individualism and communitarianism with the belief that the individual should realise their own potential and that everyone has a responsibility to care for the community collectively. Moreover, \"as part of its wider reform of the welfare and modernisation agendas, New Labour [had] sought to emphasise the role and responsibilities of family and community in the provision of welfare services\" (Mooney, 2007). Here it is evident that the sole focus of neo-revisionism was essentially a Labour rebranding exercise to appeal to the masses and attract business interests following four consecutive UK general election defeats, it introduced important measures that promoted social justice and improved the position of the most disadvantaged in society. The government had aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations and had done so very well.<nl><nl>This rebranded party proved to be largely successful for the first few years and the idea of the \"Third way\" appealed largely to the masses, however over time, Blair\u2019s popularity began to decline. Although the Conservatives lost the 2001 election, they persisted in arguing that New Labour wasn\u2019t delivering its policy promises. This began to prove effective as there was a significant fall in the number of people who expected service delivery to either get better or much better over the next few years as \"healthcare by September 2003 8 per cent fewer people expected the NHS to \u2018get better\u2019 over the following year. At the same time, the government\u2019s satisfaction ratings fell sharply from a 54 per cent in September 2001, to 36 per cent in September 2002 and 25 per cent in September 2003\" (Hindmoor, 2005). There are many reasons as to why this happened, the main being the tragedy of Iraq which ensnared him so completely that by Summer of 2007 he had acknowledged he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. It is believed that \"Iraq [had] come to dominate the Blair legacy to such an extent that many of his notable achievements \u2013 the Good Friday agreement, devolution to Scotland and Wales, the minimum wage and a number of social reforms are doomed to shelter under its shadow\" (BBC News, 2019). As a combined result of the\u00a0Blair\u2013Brown pact, Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour Party for\u00a0Blair\u00a0to resign and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election.<nl><nl>The Financial crisis and recession of 2008-09 led to a minor shift in policy by the Brown government but still maintained a majority of the New Labour values and principles. Gordon Brown had primacy over vast areas of domestic policy and handled the banking collapse, as the unpopularity of the Iraq war had meant that a new focus was needed for the party. In its foreign policy choices, the Brown government was quite similar to that of Tony Blair\u2019s as it \"displayed the same unshakeable Atlanticism, pronounced Euroscepticism, and commitment to increasing international aid to 0.7% of gross national income as its coalition successor\" (Lee, 2019). In both health and education, \"Brown continued the Blair governments\u2019 pattern of top-down reorganisation of hospitals and schools, and the increasing use of private sector finance and organisations to deliver services\" (Lee, 2019). He supported increased spending on hospitals, pledged to make reform of the NHS a major priority and also promised to retain the public-sector reforms implemented by Blair. In domestic policy terms, the impact of devolution meant that the Brown government\u2019s capacity to reform public services was confined to England, where Brown had no personal democratic mandate to intervene.<nl><nl>Although, Brown retained a vast majority of Blair\u2019s policies, he set out plans to decentralise Britain and make good the more evident weaknesses of Blairism, not least its careless disregard for civil liberties. However, two developments quickly derailed the new prime minister\u2019s hopes. In \"August 2007 the first cracks appeared in the international banking system, cracks that would lead to the run on the Northern Rock bank the first run on a bank in Britain for 150 years \u2013 and its eventual nationalisation by New Labour \u2013 an irony after years of pro-business rhetoric\" (White, 2019). After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a recession in 2008 leading to poor results in the\u00a0local\u00a0and European elections in 2009. Brown had broken an earlier promise not to raise income tax levels by creating a new 50% band, to be paid by those who earned more than \u00a3150,000 a year which led to claims that New Labour ideology had been abandoned. <nl><nl>Despite a Conservative rule, Ed Miliband struggled to balance his more left-wing views with a desire to appeal to the centre ground. Under his leadership the Labour Party maintained some elements of New Labour policies, while shifting slightly to the left. The new leader called for the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax and the need to re-establish Labour\u2019s reputation as a competent manager of the economy was an important concern for Miliband. He tried to combine New Labour\u2019s support for business with the defence of the party\u2019s core working-class constituency by drawing a distinction between what he called \u2018predatory\u2019 and \u2018responsible capitalism. At the 2015 election Miliband pledged to reduce the deficit every year of the next parliament. He insisted that Labour\u2019s spending plans would be paid for without additional borrowing. \"Miliband [pledged] to fund the NHS improvements with a mansion tax on properties worth over \u00a32m. other tax pledges include the restoration of the 10p tax band for low earners\" (The Independent, 2019). However, by 2015 there was pressure from the left of the party for Labour to adopt a much more radical approach. Some party member attributed the landslide victory of the SNP in Scotland, where Labour was left with just one Westminster seat, to the party being insufficiently left wing.<nl><nl>\"Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two\" (BBC News, 2019). Jeremy Corbyn sinisterly told photographers and journalists \"under Socialism you will all cooperate\" (Express.co.uk, 2019) suggesting a radical shift to the left. He took the Miliband-balls idea of increased investment in the economy further, calling for large-scale funding of industry and infrastructure organised by a National Investment Bank. He called for the renationalisation of the railways, a policy the New Labour governments refused to adopt. Instinctively supporting intervention of an Old Labour kind, he demanded that companies publish pay audits with the aim of countering discrimination in the workplace. \"Labour has pledged to rejuvenate the UK's neglected high streets, nationalize public services and some major industries, and force all large firms to give their employees a share of the business and a voice on their boards. Critics of Labour say these policies are throwbacks to failed socialist governments of the 1970s\" (Vonberg, 2019). Like Miliband, he favoured the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax. However, Corbyn was much more clear-cut in his competition to austerity, characterising it as a political choice that harmed the most vulnerable members of society, rather than an economic necessity. Many bold claims have been made about Corbyn with \"Corbyn may not be a Communist, but he\u2019s certainly a Marxist\" (The Northern Echo, 2019) being one of the boldest. Corbyn strongly opposed benefit cuts and a socialist he regarded the poor as the victims of capitalism, who are entitled to public support. He opposed the use of the private sector to deliver public services \u2013 a central aspect of New Labour. Thus, he argued for a wholly state-run NHS. In order to promote lifelong education and training, he called for a national education service, and opposed student tuition fees. By contrast, Ed Miliband had confined himself to advocating their reduction from \u00a39,000 to \u00a36,000 a year. In terms of law and order policy, Corbyn was opposed to the more hard-line policies of the New Labour era, such as increased powers to combat terrorism and the introduction of identity cards. This became a less controversial policy area within the labour party \u2013 both Blairites and Corbynites found common ground in opposing government cuts to police number. Corbyn consistently voted against the use of force and favoured the withdrawal of the UK from NATO\u2019s military structure and the abolition of the Trident nuclear weapons system, again placing him at odds with New Labour. `He followed the mainstream of his party in supporting continued British membership of the EU, emphasising its positive role in protecting workers\u2019 rights.<nl><nl>In conclusion, it is evident that the Labour Party had been redefined to a large extent, beginning as a more centrist party in 1997 and eventually becoming a more radical socialist party in present day. Through several policy failures, the Labour Party established that it needed to rebrand itself once again to adapt to current affairs. It is evident that Gordon Brown maintained a large amount of the New Labour principles however, Ed Miliband realised that this new and reformed party wasn\u2019t going to get them through the 2015 election. This resulted in more left-wing agendas being proposed and the Labour Party promoting themselves as a more socialist organisation. Thus, to conclude, the Labour Party has been redefined to a large extent with several shifts throughout the political spectrum over the years.", "positive": "You will be staying at the Radisson Blue Seaside Hotel \u00a3172 per night.

{"anchor": "Abstract<nl>This experiment was conducted to investigate the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) using a cued visual attention task. The hypothesis for this experiment were that participants alpha range activities would be higher in the cue left than cue right when recording from the left of the parietal lobe. Participants were cued to expect stimuli on the right or left. The results were as hypothesised: when recording alpha range activity from the left parietal lobe amplitudes were higher in the left cue than right cue condition. In conclusion alpha activity can be modulated by attention and visual stimuli is processed on the opposite side stimuli is presented. The data were valid in his experiment.<nl>Introduction<nl>AIH is where high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). However, alpha is reduced in task relevant brain areas this means that alpha activity can be modulated by attention. Visual stimuli is processed contralaterally, so stimuli presented on the right will be processed on the left and stimuli presented on the left will be processed on the right. Handel at al (2001) explains that higher alpha power contralateral to the unattended side means that unattended stimuli is associated with an increase in alpha activity, that therefore means alpha frequencies are higher if stimuli are not paid attention to. Sauseng et al. (2015) study, participants saw a cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms, an arrow showing which hemifield a target would appear was presented at the centre. There was an interval of 600-800ms. White bars on black background were presented for 50ms. Sauseng et al. (2015) had similar results to Handel in that there was less alpha activity on the side of the brain stimuli were processed. This shows that there is more alpha activity in the parietal lobe on the side where stimuli is not processed.<nl>In this experiment a partial replication of Sauseng et al (2005) was conducted. This was recorded on the left parietal lobe (P3) as he found that parietal sites were good indicators of alpha in relation to attention. Therefore, the hypothesis for this experiment is that alpha amplitudes (in microvolts) would be higher in the cue left than cue right when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe. <nl><nl><nl><nl>METHOD<nl>Participants<nl>There were 39 participants initially, but one participants' data was removed as data was only available for one of the two conditions therefore 38 participants data was collected and analysed.

A Biopac was set up to record alpha range activity (8-13Hz) and to receive left and right cue event markers. The sampling rate was 1000 Hz.

The reference electrode is attached to Fz as it provides a comparison. Finally earth electrode reduces electrical activity and will be attached to the forehead near the hairline.<nl>The impedance was checked and was below 10 kOhms.There were 12 practice trials in total where the ISI were fixed, and participants were given feedback.\u00a0The experimental trials were the same as the practice trials but there were\u00a020 blocks of 4 trials\u00a0(cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar)\u00a0and 80 trials in total with random time interval. Experimenters told participants that they would see cues with an arrow presented for 34ms and to expect a stimulus.There was an interval between 600 and 800ms. The stimuli either large or small bar were shown for 50ms. Experimenters told participants to respond on the keyboard with \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset during the experimental but not practice trials. The event markers allowed us to identify exactly when stimulus appeared on the screen. 200ms before stimulus onset were isolated to examine the effect of the cues on brain activity. Participants were debriefed and had a right to withdraw data. The experimenter cleaned the participant and analysed the data. <nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment <nl>The period of 200ms before stimulus onset was looked at and analysed. To get the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to the average data event markers were sent from psychoPy to identify when stimuli were presented. The alpha amplitudes in the 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. Rectifying the raw data turns all the minus values into plus values giving an average deviation from 0 in microvolts regardless of whether the alpha activity was excitatory or inhibitory. Averaging over 50 samples minimising outliers and extreme values, smoothing the curves making it easier to interpret the data. The data is then known as Rectified and averaged Alpha Amplitudes (RAAA).<nl>Analysis<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that median alpha amplitudes in P3 were higher in the cue left than cue right condition 200ms before the stimulus was presented, A Shapiro-Wilk test showed the values for the cue left and cue right conditions: (W= 0.827, n =38, p &lt;.001) and (W=0.846, n=38, p &lt;.001) The data were not normally distributed (p\u00a0&lt; .05) therefore a Wilcoxon signed ranks test was done to analyse the data. This showed that the difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p &lt; .005). <nl>Discussion<nl>The research hypothesis was supported in that alpha activity increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left hemifield as opposed to the right hemifield 200ms before stimulus was presented. These results were consistent with alpha inhibition hypothesis as high alpha amplitudes and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007) on the ipsilateral side where cue was presented. Stimuli that was presented on the right was processed on the left and stimuli presented on the left was processed on the right consistent with Handel at al (2001) research.<nl>A methodological problem that might have affected the results is doing an experiment in a distracting environment as noise can disrupt attention and concentration when this experiment is a visual attention task. This experiment was conducted in a room full of people also conducting their experiment which accumulated to loud noise. Spencer et al (2000) also concludes that noisy environments are known to influence cognitive processing. Noise can be very distracting leading to interference making the results vary in validity. Another methodological problem that could occur is varying levels of impedance. Strict adherence to impedance of &lt; 10kOhms is required here, a higher or lower impedance can make the experiment invalid.<nl>\u00a0In conclusion the differences were in the anticipated direction empirically and theoretically consistent with other researchers' results suggesting that, despite some of the issues, the data were valid as it supports the AIH theory of stimuli presented on the right will be processed on the left and vice versa. Overall, this means that this study was reliable making it replicable as it follows the same results as Sauseng et al\u2019s (2005) study.", "positive": "lo,<nl>Yes that would be great if you could send it to my term time address.<nl>Thank you very much.<nl><part_FN_SN> <nl><nl>(Second year student)<new>Hi <addr1_FN>, <nl>Sorry I cannot attend the tutor meeting tomorrow as I have a death in the family that is very personal to me. <nl>If there is anything important please let me know!<nl>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. <nl>Thank you !<nl><nl><part_FN_SN><nl>(Second year student)<new>Hello <addr1_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>How are you?

The seafront is absolutely stunning so I think you'll enjoy it. The hotel has a restaurant that serves breakfast too. There's a National Museum of Finland that shows Finland's history starting right from the Stone Age, which is a 7 minutes drive from the hotel. The typical national dish is Sauteed Reindeer and the restaurant serving it or versions of it is called; Kaarna Baari &amp; Britto, which is about 6 minutes drive from the hotel. It specialises in local dishes. Kankurin Tupa is a gift shop where you can buy souvenirs for your children and it's about 7 minutes from the hotel. Finally, there's the Apollo live club that hosts events such as comedy and live music concerts (not opera), about 6 minutes drive from the hotel.

{"anchor": "Hi Sophie, I have compiled a itinerary of all the things you would want to do on your trip to Helsinki for your two-day conference on the 2nd-4th September. Firstly, I have found a hotel called the Radisson Blue seaside hotel as i know you like the water and would want to be near it, this hotel is only 1 mile away from the Hetrikani beach and has stunning ocean views from the room. it is \u00c2\u00a377 a night within your budget and has many features such as AC, barlounge, a gym in case you would want to blow off any steam from the conference. It has many positive reviews and is deemed one of the best in Helsinki! It also is near many great sights so travelling will be very convenient. It is 6 mins from a museum as well as 2 mins from a escape room in case you would want to partake any other activities during your trip. The cafe I found for you to have breakfast at is called Eckberg cafe and is only a 12 min walk away from the hotel and they have many positive reviews and the images of the food also look amazing! The national museum of Finland are home to many artefacts and feature a great deal of history which will be perfect for you to get to know the history of the place and is only a 20 minute metro journey from the hotel, with the metro also near the hotel, perfect for travelling there! In terms of the restaurant, I found the restaurant Olo for you, it has a unique ambience with amazing food and are cautious with dietary requirements as I know you are allergic to shellfish. This restaurant is also close by to the hotel being 19 mins away! The lioporo gift shop is also home to some amazing handmade souvenir and typical souvenirs so you can get authentic gifts for your children, and again this is all close by so you don't have to worry about not having time due to your busy schedule! Finally, I know you wanted a nice live music venue to wind down in the evenings and I have found the Tavasata which is the no.1 live music venue in Helsinki and is described as legendary and iconic and is only 6 mins away! I will confer with you later about all these places and I hope they are to your liking.

{"anchor": "Dear Madam, Here are the details of the itinerary items I have created for your conference trip to Helsinki between the 2nd and 4th of September 2021. I have found a 4-star hotel situated 0.4 miles away from the city centre. For two nights it will cost \u00a3216. It is also situated close to the Seurasaraselka waters so, if we book a room with a view you will always get to see the water. This is \u00a316 over budget but it was the best option in regards to tourist reviews and location. Caferino Obas is a cafe, which is only a ten-minute walk away from the hotel and they offer a great breakfast menu. They offer a wide range of options and alternatives for those who are allergic to Seafood. Helsinki Museum is a twenty-minute walk from the hotel but it is specifically a museum popular with tourists for being able to \"uphold Helsinki's heritage\". Therefore you will learn a lot about the city you are visiting. Finland's national dish is Saute\u00e9d Reindeer. So I have found a very popular restaurant called Restaurant Lasipalatsi which offers this dish. They have a wide range of sides to go with this dish and before booking the restaurant we are able to call them up beforehand and warn them about your seafood allergy. Therefore the food will be catered for you specifically. There is a souvenir shop called Mikebon which offer a wide range of gifts. Especially toys which may be great for your children. Finally, for the evening I have found a Rock Music Club called Tavastia. Since you love live music I have found a club that offers Helsinki's popular genre and the club itself is quite old so this holds some heritage too. I hope you like the suggestions.

{"anchor": "Faces are vital in conveying emotions and allowing humans to nonverbally interact with each other (Little et al., 2011). It also allows us to distinguish other social drivers such as power, attractiveness, and personality traits, just from a glimpse (Zebrowitz, 2017). Regarding emotion, there has been an ongoing debate to see to what extent facial displays of emotion are universal. With more research coming into the light, arguments have been swayed to not support the idea of universality.<nl><nl>To \u2018correctly\u2019 recognise emotion from a facial display can be considered subjective, as one person will not perceive emotion in the same manner as another. Yet some studies have shown the \u2018happy\u2019 facial display to be the most correctly recognized facial display out of the proposed seven (Mishra et al., 2018; West et al., 2012). Difficulties come into play when there are a variety of smiles from a \u2018happy\u2019 face that can be distinguished (Frank, 2002). This comes to question on the universality of emotions in faces. <nl>This leads on to explain the theoretical models that have been proposed to refute the universality theory of emotions in facial displays. The behavioural ecology view of facial displays (BECV) is one theory from an array of theoretical models which takes the stance against the universality thesis (Crivelli &amp; Fridlund, 2018). It claims that the emotions we express through our faces are a \u2018social tool\u2019, meaning that we use our face to nonverbally interact and elicit reactions from humans. The theory had also recognised that facial displays of emotion will vary across different environments, this notion was supported by Crivelli\u2019s own study in the Trobriand Island, where he had found low levels of correct recognition on all five of the facial displays by the Trobrianders (Crivelli et al., 2017).<nl><nl>Further research that supports the BECV has often looked at how facial recognition of emotion differs between culture; the significance of Ekman\u2019s work in cross-cultural studies tends to be cited around this topic. However, with more research around emotion becoming apparent, new studies tend to have a different perspective on Ekman\u2019s study. For instance, in one of his studies, he had reported that the Fore Tribe tended to select the 'surprised' photograph 67% of the time when a story about \u2018someone feeling fearful\u2019 was told (Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1971). Dailey et al (2010) had found the same result in his study but brought a different angle to the table. He had used Japanese and American participants rather than a small-scale indigenous society; the Japanese participants tended to sway more towards the surprised face when it was a fear face being presented on the screen.<nl><nl>Dailey et al\u2019s (2010) main conclusion on this result was it initially came down to cultural differences, as the Japanese and the Fore tribe have different social contexts compared to the westerners. But specifically, he went to mention in his discussion that Japanese people tend to not fear strangers as much as Americans do (Matsumoto, 1988). In this case, Japanese people would not view the fear facial expression as occasionally in their daily life as Americans, this would therefore explain why they did not correctly identify a \u2018fear\u2019 facial display in the tasks when it was presented. Hence, it can be argued that social contexts will affect one\u2019s perceptions of recognising facial displays of emotions.<nl><nl>Nevertheless, studies like the ones mentioned above tend to use facial displays that exaggerate the emotion however, in real life emotions tend to not be expressed in such a \u2018cartoon-like\u2019 way, instead, they are more subtle and sometimes even morphed with other emotions. With this being said evidence still shows that there are cultural differences in identifying subtle facial expressions. In a recent study by Zhang et al (2014), they had found that Americans were better at judging subtle negative emotions (angry and sad) than Chinese participants. It is said that this occurs because it is common for Chinese people to express their negative emotions more outwardly, as subtle negative facial expressions might hinder their interpersonal harmony in their society (Matsumoto 1989; Matsumoto and Ekman 1989; Matsumoto et al., 2008). So, subtle negative emotions such as \u2018anger\u2019 and \u2018sad\u2019 would not be recognised in facial expressions. In essence, this still supports the fact that there are cultural differences regardless of facial expressions being presented in a more subtle or overemphasised manner.  <nl><nl>The studies above clearly emphasize the fact that facial recognition of emotions cannot be universal, as there are significant differences when both cultures were identifying emotions from faces; this comes down to differences in cultural context as they vary in \"social ideologies and practices of the cultural groups\" (Jack et al., 2012). This comes in line to support the BECV theory, as both studies highlight that context is important and impacts a person in identifying emotions from facial expressions.<nl><nl>The cross-cultural studies mentioned above might have some limitations, for example, they tend to only follow an etic approach as researchers will usually be outside of the culture they are studying, which might mean valuable detail in communication could be lost in translation sometimes (Buil et al., 2012). Accordingly, converging neurological studies helps in the understanding of how the brain affects behaviour regardless of social context; so, research in this area would not be impacted by an etic or emic approach, which would help in further understanding why facial recognition of emotion is not universal. <nl><nl>In opposition to the BECV theory, Ekman had proposed an outdated \u2018Basic emotions theory\u2019 (BET) which followed a more Darwinian approach. It emphasised that facial expressions of emotion are a biological process and is hardwired, with seven basic emotions that humans can express and identify from (Ekman and Friesen, 1969); therefore, it can show a universal pattern in recognising facial displays of emotion regardless of social context. <nl><nl>The field of neuropsychology has challenged the BET by stating that facial recognition of emotion is not as hardwired and biological as it seems. In regard to the Haxby et model (2000), it has stated that facial perception occurs in the core system (superior temporal sulcus) and then further expands into the extended system in where the amygdala will be able to process emotion from faces. This model is supported by Foley et al\u2019s study (2012) as it found an increase in activity levels of the bilateral STS and the amygdala when perceiving emotions from facial expressions. <nl><nl>The universality thesis comes to be challenged when impairments in the amygdala occur; when the amygdala is impaired there are significant differences that are seen in the processing of negative emotions (Whalen et al., 2013). This will be further examined by looking into individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as they display an atypical amygdala (Kliemann et al., 2012). A study that had shown this had used Ekman and Friesen\u2019s (1976) series of facial displays in an upright and inverted manner, to witness if ASD individuals identified emotions differently (Wallace et al., 2008). They had found that people with ASD were significantly worse at identifying facial displays in both upright and inverted conditions, they had even tended to misidentify 'fear' for 'anger'. This was similarly seen in Ashwin et al\u2019s (2006) study where ASD individuals were more impaired on emotions such as \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018anger\u2019 and \u2018disgust\u2019. This shows that impairment in the amygdala does affect how ASD individuals perceive emotion in faces. <nl><nl>Black et al (2017) had argued that behaviour studies are not able to localise where the difficulty lies in the brain of ASD individuals, so we cannot assume correlation will imply causation. Instead, neuroimaging studies will provide us with the neural specificity to locate what parts of the brain that actually cause this disruption. Hence, a review had examined a variety of neurological studies and had found an association between the amygdala in ASD people and facial emotion recognition (Harms et al., 2010). A supporting study had used a functional magnetic resonance imaging and found that ASD adults had a greater right amygdala activation when viewing facial displays, than neurotypical adults (Monk et al., 2010). <nl><nl>In addition, this evidence can expand to further diagnosis\u2019 such as people with encephalitis, who also have severe amygdala damage; they tend to show the same recognition as ASD individuals with identifying fear and disgust (Sprengelmeyer, 1998). This has been further highlighted in Broks et al (1998) study, where the individuals had difficulties identifying fear in a facial emotion recognition task. This conveys that regardless of what diagnosis or condition a person is suffering from, the damage to the amygdala will impact one\u2019s perception of emotion in faces.<nl><nl>The evidence that is provided above clearly goes against the BET, as ASD and encephalitis individuals were not able to correctly identify negative faces (Broks et al.,1998; Ashwin et al., 2006), meaning that it is not a biological process as Ekman had stated. But despite this, it can still be argued that if ASD individuals did have an intact amygdala, they would correctly identify emotion from faces. However, if this were the case a neurotypical individual would correctly identify all emotions in a facial emotion recognition task, but Wallace et al (2008) had found that the neurotypical individuals still managed to incorrectly recognise anger as disgust 10% of the time. This further complicates the BET, as it shows to not be as hardwired as it mentions. <nl><nl>To conclude the two opposing theories of facial recognition of emotion have two different fields of research. A large body of evidence in cultural differences has come to show that the BECV theory has been an appropriate theoretical model to explain why facial recognition is not universal, additionally, evidence in the field of neuropsychology challenges the BET  model. The converging evidence in these two fields has still come to show that the universality thesis can be refuted.", "positive": "<nl><nl>Okay that helps ease my nerves and makes sense!

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl><nl>Enterprise Rent-A-Car is an organisation with the largest position of largest transportation solutions provider in the world. They offer a variety of transportation including; car-sharing and exotic car hiring. Enterprise Holdings is its parent company with over 100,000 branches worldwide, employing more than 100,000 people (Enterprise.co.uk, 2020).\u00a0<nl><nl>Enterprise Holdings acquired City Car Club expanding to \u2018Enterprise Car Club\u2019 who hold a variety of fuel-efficient cars and vans rentable by the hour or day, through mobile devices for bookings, unlocking and returning using iOS and Android applications with tailored plans (Enterprise Holdings, 2020).\u00a0<nl><nl>Membership entails fuel servicing, breakdown cover, insurance, cleaning, and MOTs. A vehicle is only paid for when required not otherwise.\u00a0<nl><nl>This report will demonstrate a yearly period plan including different actions split over months to boost brand awareness amongst the student demographic at Aston University. <nl><nl>Segmentation, target market, differentiation and positioning <nl><nl>Segmentation is the process of dividing markets of potential customers into specific groups based on common characteristics, reducing the risk of an unsuccessful marketing campaign. The segmentation will investigate students on and off campus interested in vehicle usage whilst at university (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020).<nl><nl>A target market is the group of individuals a business aims to sell its products and services to, where marketing messages can be crafted effectively once the market is established (Omicsonline.org, 2020). The target market is aimed towards the student demographic at Aston University on and off campus coming from different towns and backgrounds. It is innovative to allow students to drive flexibly instead of incurring the cost of a vehicle overall for commuting. The segment could become profitable through promotional activities and distribution channels after identifying the segment\u2019s needs. (Marketing-Insider, 2020).<nl><nl>Differentiation of Enterprise Car club is offering a self-service car rental plan, tailored to students at cost-effective prices with virtual membership and option to rent by the hour or day, alongside a monthly membership option currently priced at \u00a35.95 per hour and monthly prices at \u00a36 per month subscription. This is more accessible to a younger demographic of students who typically use mobile technology frequently. Aston University students could see this as an opportunity to benefit by not spending significant amounts, especially with current rising costs of living. <nl><nl>Positioning refers to a business\u2019s ability to influence perceptions of consumers concerning a brand or product. The main objective is to establish an identity of an offering, so customers perceive it positively (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020). <nl><nl>Enterprise is a company that is going to be offering a cheap and available service to students alongside reducing carbon footprints(reference). This could attract segments of the demographic, who favour being conscious of the environment for the future. (reference)<nl><nl>Enterprise Rent A Cars\u2019 already significant profile to allow consumers to feel safe with the company\u2019s new service, proving the reliable position they already pose compared to competitors such as CO-wheels CarClub and SIXT. Students can be targeted through social media platforms and through campaigning on university campus similarly to UberEATS, by employing campaigners to increase awareness.<nl><figure><nl>A perceptual map is a tool used to differentiate competitors and highlight any gaps in the market. It shows our business as a high quality and low-price service, highlighting the potential for the brand to succeed and gain awareness amongst students. One of our main competitors is SIXT, discovered by constructing this perceptual map, we have established our advantage as we offer suitable age restrictions on the use of rentals as students will want to travel inside and outside of Birmingham more frequently. <nl><nl><figure><nl>Campaign objectives <nl>Specific is a clear, precise and directional objective put forward to understand what results are expected within the workforce, instead of the objective being generalised, causing confusion and poorer results (Lalama, 2015). An effective goal would be to increase sales by a certain percentage or increase the target on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis. <nl><nl>Our specific objectives are <nl>1)To attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. <nl>2)To improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service <nl><nl>Measurable measures a goal and is the stage where numbers come into fruition to keep track of progress. However, it can be difficult to understand if an objective has been reached. <nl><nl>Our measuring will be through:<nl><nl>1)Using surveys to measure student\u2019s demand based on needs and wants, <nl>2)Identifying any potential niches. <nl><nl>This would allow the measurable objective of attaining 40-50 subscription members each month and link to the founding values of the company to honour consumers by listening to them.<nl><nl>Achievable goals are setting goals in a realistic period by taking small, planned steps towards a goal. <nl><nl>1)An example of a goal to be set is attaining data within each quarter of the year alongside aiming to increase brand awareness by 10%. Additionally, once achieved, the goal can progress to 20 new subscription members to achieve progression. <nl><nl>Overall this will contribute to the objective of reaching out to Aston University staff and students, with reasonable pricing that is visibly differentiated to competitors.<nl><nl>Realistic is forming goals based on the context of current economic, organisational and market conditions (Anon, 2020). <nl><nl>1)The current economic state will determine the likelihood of success when aiming to increase sales, as this would not be the best goal to set if the country is close to experiencing a recession period in their economic cycle.<nl><nl>2)Being the best low-cost provider is an example of a realistic goal for Enterprise CarClub profile competition, considering economic uncertainty in the UK because of Brexit. People may be less inclined to invest in vehicle ownership or maintenance because of the potential future inflation rate and currency value volatility.<nl><nl>3)Targeting 500 students as dealing with a small target market in the geographic location of Birmingham, this is a link to what we want to achieve and realistic. <nl><nl>Targeted &amp; Timed is using a specified deadline to reach a goal. If a time expiration does not exist, it will hinder efforts towards an achievement and evaluation.<nl><nl>1)Trying to achieve the specified number by the end of the year at Aston University, the target will be achieved through pushing collaborations through social media, helping target and appeal to the target market. <nl><nl>2)Customers will be more engaged with the services being offered, whilst measuring the effectiveness of this approach during and after and if results are proving unsatisfactory, measures can be taken to improve consumer satisfaction (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). <nl>Strategy and general rationale for specific tools <nl><nl>In the marketing strategy, there has been research on five stages, concerning our strategy. In initial thought, developing a strategic mission, vision and values allow Enterprise CarClub to set its standard to consumers and provide a positive image for their services. Setting objectives as stated in campaign objectives would be important to reach the vision, but meeting targets will only be possible if a strategy is tailored to the intended path. Executing the strategy would be the next step aided by prerequisites put in place, for example; a Gantt chart to work with, values to work towards goals and a mission to work on present communications to gain significant awareness.\u00a0After executing the strategy, the focus is on analysing the external environment continuously, alongside the company\u2019s internal situation to identify corrective adjustments (Gamble, Thompson and Peteraf, 2019).<nl>General rationale for specific tools selected:<nl><nl>In the marketing plan, looking further into advertising as a negotiated form of traditional and digital communication from an identifiable source can influence audiences. In the marketing plan, we are looking to follow a push strategy through Enterprise\u2019s profile to attract the target market to buy subscriptions. It will allow Enterprise CarClub to reach the goal of building awareness with students, encourage and incentivise them to build a differentiated strategy in competition with others. A community of consumers can be built alongside the strategy by considering and monitoring brand image. (Richards and Curran, 2002).<nl><nl>Secondly, Sales Promotion is going to be used as it influences consumers in a way to buy a product (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is a tool that will influence student behaviour positively as incentives will be offered to trial the service initially and then decide to proceed if satisfied. A pull strategy will reel in consumers through discounts, bonuses, and coupons creating a feeling of need for the service. <nl><nl>Marketing Tool Plans- <nl>Advertising Tool<nl>Advertising is a strong form of communication that will enable Enterprise CarClub to reach their audience through engaging using a variety of resources, using the media category to carry advertising messages to allow for the use of billboards, magazines, digital newspapers and mobile and online advertising (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). <nl><figure><nl>Digital media has a strong level of interactivity in modern lives with social media being very prominent, for example, Instagram. Using this tool will provide Enterprise with a giant opportunity for advertisement (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is prefered to use this tool because of the benefits it will bring in terms of reaching a wider audience, especially with electronic word of mouth having a large impact and high level of users. Advertising holds the credibility to support marketing efforts such as; sales promotion, using methods to secure customers into the car rental subscriptions as consumers spend on what they believe will bring them reputable value.\u00a0<nl><nl>Advertising holds the capability of effecting knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviour of a target audience, persuading individuals to buy a product they have never purchased. It can suggest that advertising can increase sales using manipulative and psychological techniques with a large segment of passive consumers concerning the \u2018Strong\u2019 theory of advertising (Fill, 2009).\u00a0<nl><nl>The\u00a0(AIDA)\u00a0model presents creating brand\u00a0awareness\u00a0of a product or service,\u00a0the interest\u00a0of the benefits of its uses to build sufficient foundation to encourage the buyer to research further,\u00a0desire\u00a0to go forward with an emotional connection through brand personality making consumers want it and\u00a0action\u00a0to make the buyer take the next step of engaging in making a phone call, signing up to a newsletter or engaging in a live chat for further information.<nl><nl>With awareness, a PR campaign can be running towards the student target market each month with different resources. Interest wise we could use surveys to gain student interest on campus to then offer further consultation after gaining the initial interest of what is important to their tailored service. Desire could lead to running local buzz campaigns to generate discounts due to the curiosity of a new service. An action could be to use local advertising alongside social media to receive discounts during face to face or phone advertising to show empathy to needs for the short term or long term (How much do celebrities and influencers get paid for social posts? - Our Social Times - Social Media for Business, 2020).<nl><nl>Sales Promotion Tool<nl><nl>Sales promotion offers an incentive to encourage target audiences with promotional messages to buy the product sooner than later (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It creates a differentiated strategy, launching the new Enterprise CarClub at Aston University by offering value to customers through planning sales promotion to incentivise students. Upselling opportunities are created with a variety of packages, starting from \u00a34.50, enhanced at \u00a33.45hour and under 22s at \u00a35.95hour plans.<nl><nl>Sales Promotion presents the entrance to a partnership endorsement by sponsoring our car rental service. A well-known Birmingham hip hop artist \u2018Mist\u2019 will be integrated, who possesses a following of 670,000 (Instagram.com, 2020). By working in collaboration, this will build brand credibility and make the brand stand out to the demographic at Aston. Consumers will recall and remember the promotion, bringing in targeted behavioural marketing. Therefore, the student\u2019s interest is captured, making them feel more inclined to sign up for the subscription (The Pros and Cons of Celebrity Endorsements - Baer Performance Marketing, 2020).. This partnership will offer a promotional online code discount and print coupons associated with himself to pull in more consumers to use the service, working towards the goal of reaching 500 buyers by year-end. He is already proactive in supporting Birmingham to make the city a better place through his involvement in projects, he will be more inclined to partner at a lower price than expected by an influencer of his popularity. (Mist Interview: U.K. Star Talks Hometown of Birmingham &amp; U.S. Rap Influences| Billboard, 2020). <nl><nl>Endorser attributes tie in with the TEARS model of trustworthiness, relating to endorsement being someone who can be trusted, have respect and expertise in the brand, physical attractiveness with pride in his health. Coming from a disadvantaged background in Birmingham, then progressing resonates with the target audience as students use him as inspiration towards goals. To have someone who is not just someone with a conative but affective strategy too, makes consumers feel to act on the Enterprise CarClub through a use of display of emotion and care (The Five Components in the TEARS Model of Endorser Attributes T Trustworthiness | Course Hero, 2020).<nl><nl>Managerial accountability allows the results of sales promotion to be easily justified in comparison to advertising. This way the margin for error as a calculated number will help in realising if the chosen promotion is effective towards our target market (Fill and Turnbull, 2016; Difference between advertising and sales promotion, 2020). <nl><nl>Implementation plan demonstrating the relative scheduling of Marcom tool activity:<nl><figure><nl>Creating the Gantt chart has enabled the 12 months of promotion for Enterprise Car Club to be planned out month by month. It establishes clear objectives and timeframes for which each tool should be executed. Using the advertising tool helps build brand value and image by encouraging change in consumer behaviour. <nl>For the advertising tool, TV advertisements, billboards, and promotional products will use the pulsing marketing strategy. <nl><nl>These are scheduled as a continuous schedule lasting the whole year at a low level throughout, becoming heavier during the peak times for selling (Continuous Advertising Definition | Marketing Dictionary | MBA Skool-Study.Learn. Share., 2020). <nl><nl>The peak times here are September, to take advantage of the advertising opportunities during freshers when students are most interested. Also, from December to February, the advertising tool is being used alongside our sponsor Mist performing, allocated sufficiently before the event and after to keep the awareness going. <nl><nl>Viral marketing is a flighting strategy due to the one-month period it is allocated solely to throughout the year. Within the advertising tool, internetsocial media adverts will be the continuous marketing strategy, as they will be available and shown to customers throughout the whole year, unlike the other tasks within the tool (Flighting, 2020). <nl><nl>The sales promotion tool will make use of discountscoupons and loyalty schemes as a continuous marketing strategy. These methods will always be available to consumers, so they are reminded of the need for the services, regardless of sales performance at any given time of the year. The fresher\u2019s fair, contests, exhibitions, and fairs will all be making use of the flighting strategy as the advertising will be run at certain planned times, then have a cessation period throughout the year<nl>(9 Benefits of Sales Promotions - Gary A. Sanchez, 2020).<nl><nl>Integration of marcoms <nl><nl>Our specific objective is to improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service and to attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. Advertising and sales promotion have been decided as the two main tools because of brand awareness it will provide the up and coming brand. Advertising is informing and reminding about the products and services and a form of mass communication and links to sales promotion goals to increase sales quickly using discounts for example. Considering the timeframe and the main aim to build awareness in the Aston student\u2019s target market, these tools provide a gateway to pull in consumers through trailing the service and use of endorsements to capture loyal customers.", "positive": "nk you!

Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant\u2019s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is \u00a352,000, any award exceeding \u00a325,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder\u2019s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee\u2019s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks\u2019 notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks\u2019 notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks\u2019 worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal\u2019s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use \u2018other substantial reason,\u2019 ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be \u2018misconduct,\u2019 regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder\u2019s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>\u2022 No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>\u2022 Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>\u2022 Narinder\u2019s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>\u2022 The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder\u2019s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>\u2022 Same as Option 1. <nl>\u2022 WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder\u2019s behaviour. <nl>\u2022 WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>\u2022 Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>\u2022 Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 You will be free from Narinder\u2019s treatment. <nl>\u2022 You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>\u2022 You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>\u2022 You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>\u2022 Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>\u2022 You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>\u2022 Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>\u2022 Same as Option 4.<nl>\u2022 There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks\u2019 worth salary (\u00a310,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately \u00a34,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (\u00a31,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your \u2018Christmas [bonus]\u2019 regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual \u2018right[s] to receive.\u2019 <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days\u2019 leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days\u2019 worth salary (\u00a33,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals \u00a319,263.96. This includes notice salary (\u00a310,000), Pension (\u00a34,000), untaken leave (\u00a33,703.96) and Christmas bonus (\u00a31,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals \u00a317,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals \u00a311,763.96 or \u00a310,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal\u2019s maximum award of \u00a325,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. <nl><nl>Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. <nl>Basic Award <nl>Tribunal will award you \u00a36,300 based on your weekly gross salary (\u00a3525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. <nl><nl>Compensatory Award<nl>The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (\u00a378,000), as it is below \u00a386,444 cap. This may be lower (\u00a325,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job.<nl><nl>If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (\u00a384,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. <nl><nl>Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this.  The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. <nl><nl>Additional information<nl>Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract.<nl><nl>Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. <nl><nl>I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely, <nl>", "positive": "t sorry<new>Mines 11 odd weeks<new><day><new>I\u2019m changing to even weeks<new>I changed to <day> 12 on even weeks<new>Because of my sister<new>Why?

{"anchor": "Within the study of Psychology, the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspectives have contributed immensely in relation to its similarities and differences of its core assumptions and features. As the assumptions within the Biological perspective consist on behaviour being solely a result of biology such as neurotransmitter and genetics; in comparison to the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective which consist of behaviour-based experiences within the environment and the unconscious. In the following essay, I will discuss the key features and assumptions of both perspectives revolving around their similarities and differences. <nl>The Biological Perspective adopts the nature approach to behaviour, as its assumptions solely revolve around the concept of behaviour is hard-wired. This is evident within its explanation for disorders such as Schizophrenia as Gottesman (1991) found that Monozygotic twins hold the highest percentage of 48% who are at a \u2018Lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia\" in comparison to the 1% of the General population. This statistic supports the nature adoption of the biological perspective, as it states that behaviour is a result of Heredity as result of monozygotic twins sharing 100% of their genes. <nl>On the contrary, the Psychoanalytical perspective adopts both nature and nurture approach within its assumptions. As Freud proposed the assumption that our behaviour is controlled by the tripartite construction of the mind consisting of the Id, Superego and Ego.  Freud (1949) states that the Id \"contains everything that is inherited\"; this concept of inheritance similarly aligns with the biological perspective of nature having an influence on behaviour. As the Id is considered as the primitive part of the mind which includes innate instincts \"which are sexual in nature and the death instincts such as aggression\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 118). Alongside the nature aspect of this perspective, this perspective also adopts a nurture approach to behaviour in relation to the environment also having a major influence on behaviour. This is evident within the super-ego component of Freud's theory of the mind which is shaped by societal values and family upbringing.  This is developed during childhood essentially acting as a conscience within behaviour and moral guidance in \"attempting to thwart id desires\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 119). In addition to the super-ego, this perspective emphasis on nurture is also evident within Freud's Psychosexual stages of development. As the process of each stage contributes to the development of one's personality, for example during the ages 4-6 gender identity is formed through Oedipus complex (for males) and Electra complex (for females) during this Phallic stage the child will experience unconscious sexual desires for their opposite-sex parent. This unconscious desire is resolved through the child identifying with the same sex parent, therefore, leading the child to form an appropriate affection for their opposite-sex parent. However, Freud proposed the idea if this conflict was not resolved it would result in complex behaviours such as promiscuity and narcissism.<nl>Despite, both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective varying within the nature or nurture approach to behaviour, both perspectives possess a deterministic view of behaviour. As the core assumptions of the Biological Perspective holds the view that behaviour is solely a result of genetic factors and biological components. Similarly, the Psychoanalytical perspective upholds the same notion of determinism in its explanation of behaviour being controlled by instinct drives alongside with the environment also having control over behaviour.<nl>A further difference within these perspectives is the approach in relation to explaining its core assumptions. The Biological perspective adopts a reductionist approach in its explanation of behaviour as it attempts to explain behaviour through simple components such as genes, brain structure and neurotransmitters. This is evident within findings that serotonin and dopamine have a \u2018signalling effect on later-life in relation to somatosensory, anxiety and depression' (Suri et al, 2015, p. 318); therefore, this supports the reductionist view of the biological explanation as it reduces complex disorders such as depression to neurochemical basis. Alternatively, the psychoanalytical perspective adopts both a reductionist and holistic approach to explaining behaviour. The use of reductionism is evident within Freud's' explanation of reducing behaviour to the instinctive drives within the unconscious mind. Despite this, this his approach differs as he also adopts a holistic view of behaviour as he considers the individual. This is apparent within the case of Anna O, who suffered from Hysteria a psychological disorder which involved psychological stress manifesting into physical symptoms such as \u2018multiple personalities, speech difficulties, bizarre hallucinations, and inability to drink' (Benjamin, 2007, p. 116); these physical manifestations were a result of her grief from her father's death. This case supports the holistic feature in the Psychoanalytical perspective, as it considers other factors alongside unconscious drives which contribute to behaviour in comparison to the core assumptions of the biological approach which is narrow in its assumption. <nl>Furthermore, alongside the difference in their approach to explaining behaviour both perspectives also vary in investigating their core assumptions. The biological perspective is reliant on quantitative methods which provide objective measurements such as brain scans to measure the brain and behaviour; this is apparent within methods such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) which measures the blood flow of the cerebral cortex; consequently, thus providing support for the key biological features of the perspective.  This is evidently seen within research into disorders such as Depression as fMRI scans showed that depressed patients \"demonstrated more pronounced connection between the right frontal eye field and cerebellar area \"in comparison to healthy patients who demonstrated \"showed stronger connectivity between more than 20 frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions of interest and cerebellum\" (Bezmaternykh, D.D. et al, 2018, p. 734).  <nl>Alternatively, the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective revolve around qualitative methods which are subjective in nature. This is apparent with the case of Anna O as discussed above which is a central feature within the Psychoanalytical Perspective as it paved a way for the use of subjective methods such as talking therapy; therefore, providing a deeper insight on the individual than solely on numerical data as evident above within the biological perspective. <nl>By the same token, both perspectives also differ on carrying a scientific discipline whether its assumptions and features can be falsified. This is evident within the consistent falsification of the biological approach. This is evident within the contribution towards the theory of Neurons through the work of Golgi and Cajal. As Golgi produced the \u2018first clear pictures of nerve cells' through a staining technique from this he inferred that the nervous system consisted of many neurones but was physically connected to each other (Goodwin, 2015 pg. 74-75). In opposition to the work of Golgi, Cajal proposed the idea that neurones were not physically connected to each other using Golgi's staining technique to support his claim. As result of the falsification of Golgi's theory, Cajal\u2019s work has had a major contribution to the key features of the biological perspective due to the gap between the neurones to now be known as the synapse, this being a pinnacle feature of the biological perspective to explaining the behaviour through neurotransmitters.  From the consistent vulnerability to falsification within the features of the biological perspective, it is apparent that the perspective holds a scientific discipline. <nl>However, it can be argued that the Psychoanalytical perspective holds a similar scientific discipline in relation falsifiability as Hunt (2009) refers to Freud's work being \u2018fiercely attacked on one ground or another' therefore providing the psychoanalytical approach with some scientific discipline as its assumptions can be both \u2018strengthened and weakened' (pg. 225). This is evident within the development of Neo-Freudians such as Alfred Adler (1870-1937), who rejected the oversexualised perspective associated with Freud's psychoanalytical perspective but focused on the social aspect regarding primary determinates of behaviour such as environment and uniqueness of individuals. Therefore, introducing a different branch from the Psychoanalytical perspective as Individual Psychology. <nl>Finally, despite possessing a similar element of scientific discipline, the psychoanalytical perspective contrasts the biological perspective regarding its scientific credibility due to the subjective nature present within the core assumptions. This is evident within the feature of the Psychosexual stages regarding the development of gender as Freud argued that female gender identity was formed from possessing penis envy as they believed to have been castrated. This theory of female identity essentially within psychoanalytical perspective essentially lacks the scientific discipline in comparison to biological perspective as this feature within the assumption appears to base on \u2018Freud's views of women' than evidence and fact. (Benjamin, 2007, p. 130).<nl>In conclusion, despite both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective holding majority of differences within their assumptions alongside the nature of their key features holding similarities both perspectives have successfully become an integral part of Psychology today.", "positive": "e I\u2019ll show you <new>I said nahhh I\u2019ve been eating rubbish <new>It\u2019s time to transfer to banana pancakes or vegan pancakes <new>Samee maybe I can find a recipe <new>And then send in the gc <new>Coz it\u2019s without egg in it <new>The plant milk <new>Oh okay making it must be calm and yeah sure <new>This rain is terrible <new>Morning nope not yet please I\u2019m literally getting up to do it now so in that case I\u2019ll use the other shower <new>Aldi workers love to scan things so fast as if they\u2019re doing the Olympics <new>Oh yes I forgot I\u2019m coming thanks <new>We thank God I\u2019m gonna be the DJ then LOL I\u2019m gonna try and find another song before it plays a random worship song ", "attacked": "I'm looking for a recipe for banana/vegetarian pancakes, and I'm wondering if you could suggest a recipe for plant milk since I don't eat eggs."}

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>In order to analyse to what extent English law\u2019s approach to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith is satisfactory, it important to understand that the fundamental attitude towards good faith and the recent developments in good faith, that lead to a paradox within the law.  In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd , Lord Bingham defined what good faith is synonymic to, which was \"playing fair\", \"coming clean\" or \"putting one\u2019s card face upwards on the table\". This approach has been embodied by most countries outside the common law world, whereby, there is an overriding principle of good faith. However, English law, tends to abide by a piecemeal technique, which means good faith is applied as and when it is needed, rather than a general law. Nonetheless, the courts have more recently signalled a departure from such approach, as it has become increasingly more common for courts to uphold the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, and in doing so, have caused a level of uncertainty within the law.<nl>This essay will argue that the approach Courts have taken to enforce promises to negotiate in good faith is in fact unsatisfactory. This essay develops, first, by explaining the general obligations of good faith and the traditional hostility towards it. Secondly, it will focus specifically on the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith and, whether, in fact, this has been enforceable. Finally, it will be explained that, despite the attempts to define what the Courts will uphold in relation to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate, it inevitably leads to courts being too involved in commercial business and therefore, undermines the commercial stability that England places on high importance.<nl><nl>Traditional Views Towards Good Faith<nl>Historically, hostility towards the doctrine of good faith has been prevalent in English law.  Traditionally, English law develops piecemeal solution in response to the specific problems they are faced with, rather than an imposing an overriding principle of good faith. The reasoning, for this, is it creates too much uncertainty and subjectivity, but arguably, more importantly, it allows for freedom of contract and party of autonomy. As put by, Sir Roy Goode \"in what we like to think \u2013 perhaps wrongly \u2013 is the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice. It is necessary in a commercial setting that businessmen at least should know where they stand.\" Thus, indicating, why the original approach to good faith, is satisfactory because it leads to commercial certainty, which is ingrained into English law. This is fundamental to the core, further evidenced, by the fact \"the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice.\"  <nl>Conversely, this certainty that is placed on such high importance in English law, is being undermined by the exceptions where English law does recognise good faith, one of them being express promises to negotiate in good faith. Thus, meaning it is enforceable in courts. Many of these express terms to negotiate are based on the perception that both parties will be entering a joint venture, as there would be an intention to create a long term relation and parties may set out commitments for a specific time. The declarations made in the House of Lords decisions of HIH Casualty v Chase Manhattan Bank , Lord Hoffman observes  that it goes without saying that underlying the contractual arrangement of the parties there will be a common assumption that the parties involved will behave honestly. Although, there may be express terms to negotiate in good faith, the nature of these relationships alone, should call for honest, open and fair dealing. This is considered to be a relational contract. Leggatt LJ explains that communication and co-operation is based on trust and loyalty might be crucial and impliedly expected by the parties, even if not expressly stated in contract.  However, there is an issue with this definition as it has been criticised for a lack of explanation, as put by Severine Saintier, Leggatt J does not elaborate as to what relational contracts are precisely, why they require such enhanced good faithloyalty or what this would entail, which is regrettable. Such criticism simply strengthens the Court\u2019s previously hostile approach to the doctrine; due to the ambiguity in interpretation of the doctrine as there are no guidelines as to how the Court is to identify \"good faith\", and so is often done so subjectively. <nl><nl>Express Promises To Negotiate In Good Faith<nl>Nevertheless, express terms to promise to negotiate in good faith, has been favoured and welcomed; due to the flexibility and adaptability it allows for within the contract. The freedom of inserting an article that mandates a negotiation, means that parties are able to prepare themselves for future, as the future is uncertain, they are unable to dictate what the commercial environment may look like in 20 years. For instance, events, such as a recession or a plummet in the market by including a term that opens the door for renegotiations in relation to the specific term. Cases, such as Petromec , the clause was 12.4 , where it states that \u2018 Brasoil agrees to negotiate in good faith with Petromc the extra costs..\u2019 This term emphasises why parties may include an express term in the contract for future insulation against potential risks that may occur.<nl><nl>Enforceability of Promises to Negotiate through Development of Law.<nl>Case law paves the way for the enforceability of contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, by refining the scope of good faith. Walford v Miles, the case was as follows, the business owner promised the plaintiffs that it would terminate negotiations to sell business to third party, however, the business owner then sold the business to a third party. The plaintiffs argued that the business owner had a duty to negotiate in good faith. However, it was held that the promise to negotiate was unenforceable. Lord Ackner to be \"unworkable\" and \"inherently repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in negotiations.\" It is imperative for distinctions to be made between a good faith duty which governs pre \u2013 contractual relations and of those that concern a contractual performance, as well as the contrast between terms that are expressly codified for the intrusion of a duty of good faith. In light of this intricacy, Longmore LJ took on the role of understanding the criticisms that the courts have had with upholding a promise to negotiate, he pointed out three main arguments; one of them being that the obligation is an agreement to agree and this is too uncertain to enforce.. However, he dismissed this argument by stating that is carries little weight because the obligation on the facts was an express obligation in a contract that was otherwise enforceable. By arguing, these main points Longmore LJ has narrowed the vagueness, and this is best shown in the comparison of Walford v Miles and Petromec Inc v Petroleo, in the Walford case the contract was still to come into the effect of the good faith arrangement as it was still in the pre \u2013 negotiation stage, the contract was never concluded. However, in Petromec, it was clear that it was not just a bare agreement to negotiation, as it was a complex contract drafted by their lawyers. This case, is a crucial turning point in relation to promises to negotiate in good faith, as it maintains party autonomy and freedom of contract, which as mentioned is fundamental to Englands commercial environment, therefore, allows for a consistent and coherent standard of how express terms are upheld by the courts. <nl><nl><nl>The Quota To Satisfy<nl>Shaker v Visajet, was yet another case that was consistent with the way the Courts uphold express promises to negotiate in good faith. In this case, there was a promise to \u2018proceed in good faith\u2019 as well as \u2018use reasonable endeavours\u2019 to agree a documentation pursuant to the purchase of an aircraft. Teare J stated that there was no binding legal obligation based on the promise. The reason for this was because there was \u2018no objective criteria\u2019, that the court was able to decide whether the party acted unreasonably.  This further enhances the distinction using Petromec , because in the case, there was sufficient objective criteria to make the promise enforceable. However, Shaker, meant that the courts devised a test in order to see if the express promises to negotiate is enforceable; the test requires two questions to be satisfied. The first criteria to meet is, \u2018is there a certainty of object?\u2019, this relates to clarity in what the negotiation was set out to achieve e.g. responding to a change in the circumstances. The second is \u2018 are there sufficient objective criteria to determine what a good faith negotiation looks like in the context of this particular contract?\u2019 This criteria relates to the idea that the Courts should be able to look at the contract and have the exact information to uncover, what the negotiation should look like in good faith. These cases all draw to the same conclusion that promises to negotiate in good faith should be upheld and is attempted to be done so by the Courts by using precedence, the courts should not avoid enforceability due to some vagueness, on how the term is to be upheld in practical contexts.<nl><nl>Upholding the contract leading too much involvement<nl>Parties requiring terms to be upheld and enforced necessitates a court to work out what a good faith negotiation looks like in that contract, in fact it is vital to do so, because it is the only way to conclude if there has been a breach or not. There is too much vagueness surrounding the good faith negotiation, which inevitably leads to the Courts having to fill in the blanks, in essence leading them to \u2018make\u2019 the contracts for the parties. In fact, this interpretation is considered to take up more judicial time than all other areas of the law of contract put together. Although, Lord Hoffman came up with five principles governing how the courts should interpret written contracts, there was a lot of backlash for this as it was \u2018It was said to generate uncertainty because it appeared to widen the circumstances in which the judges could depart from the \u2018natural and ordinary meaning\u2019 of the words used by the parties.\u2019 The underlying issue is that, regardless, of how precise the terms are, it will inevitably lead to courts getting too involved in interpreting the contract and assuming what the parties meant instead of what they actually wrote. This in turn generates too much uncertainty and threatens the stability of the commercial environment.<nl><nl>                                       Alternatives to solve uncertainty<nl>Although, a common option for both parties is to include an arbitration, which is an alternate way of settling a dispute outside of courts, however, this has been criticised because the existence of the arbitration obligation specifically incorporated into clause itself indicates strongly that the parties were not intending to retain their freedom to agree or disagree according to their perceived interests. More importantly, as highlighted in the Emirates Trading and Associated British Ports, it leads to satellite litigation, meaning the parties go to Court arguing about not the specific breach of the contract but a separate matter arising from this, in the Emirates Trading case, it was about whether the good faith negotiation term was in fact enforceable. Satellite litigation is undesirable and in fact takes up the Courts resources and arguably, \"tends not to help with either expedition or the saving of expense and perhaps more than anything leads to disproportionality.\" Ironically, the very reason why the express promise to negotiate was avoid long-drawn-out dispute and going to court by resolving them through friendly discussions of good faith. Thus, indicating that going to court may lead to better solutions for the parties, simultaneously, altering the position and standpoint of the traditional view held by the English courts.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>To conclude, express promises to negotiate in good faith is upholding, although it has been consistent and the requirements have been made unambiguous through case law and the enforceability by the Courts have also been constant, aiding the reliability and validity. However, the issue with the Court enforcing the express terms is that, they have to work out the good faith in the negotiation, but by doing this it means that the courts are at high risk of making the parties contracts for them.

{"anchor": "Assessing Attitudes Towards Zoos<nl>Introduction: <nl>This study\u2019s hypothesis is that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos would have a wide variation. This is because some participants may have a positive attitude due to their involvement in conserving species, and some a negative attitude due to animal captivity. Reade and Waran (1996) support this, stating that zoo visitors have positive perceptions of zoos whereas members of the general public have negative views. <nl><nl>Method:<nl>Positive and negative statements about zoos were pooled in which 10 of each were selected for the pilot study (Appendix 1), which recruited 10 participants. Negative statement scores were then reversed, so that negative attitudes equate to low scores, and vice versa. To assess the internal validity of the pilot questionnaire, each participant\u2019s scores were totalled (see Appendix 3), and the 4 highest and lowest scored participants were selected. The 4s and 5s selected by positive and negative participants were compared to assess whether an item was discriminatory. Statements differing in scores between these participants fit into such criteria. 4 discriminatory positive and negative statements were selected for the main study (Appendix 2). The 10 original participants were recruited for this version, along with a further 10. The totals of each original participant were compared between the pilot and main study (Appendix 4) to assess the questionnaire\u2019s reliability. Total scores of all participants were then calculated (Appendix 5). <nl><nl>Results:<nl>The internal validity test (Appendix 3) showed that 11 statements were discriminatory: 4 negative, and 7 positive. The lowest scores ranged from 41 to 45, while the highest ranged from 55 to 69. These participants reported either the most negative or positive attitudes respectively. Only two participants produced the same score when completing the pilot study and the main study (Appendix 4). A Spearman\u2019s Rho test found that there was a significantly strong correlation between the test and re-test scores (rs = .838, p &lt; .01). 90% of participants scored higher in the pilot study compared to the main study. 3 of the 4 positive statements had standard deviations (SD) over 1 (Appendix 2), meaning that there was a wider variation of responses to these, whilst negative statements had SDs less than 1. The statement with the lowest SD was positive (SD = .489), whilst the highest was negative (SD = 1.268). As the hypothesis suggested, participants had a wide variation of scores (M = 22.4, SD = 4.297), ranging from 16 to 28 (Appendix 5). This SD indicates a large spread of data across the mean. <nl><nl>Conclusion:<nl>The results of Appendix 3 showed that there was high internal validity since the positive and negative statements differed in scores by participants, suggesting that the questionnaire measures what it was set out to measure. The Spearman\u2019s Rho test showed that the questionnaire had high test-retest reliability as results from participants were similar in the pilot compared to the main study (Appendix 4). The larger SD of the final responses of the positive statements indicate that the results are widely spread across the mean, while the smaller SDs for the negative statements suggest that there was less of a variation in responses to these. Therefore, it can be concluded that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos do not have a wide variation, as participant\u2019s responses were polarised, with a smaller variance in responses with negative statements compared to positive.

{"anchor": "Hi Ms (name), After reviewing the local area in Helsinki, I have planned an itinerary for you to view. Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging \u00c2\u00a3163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros.

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. <nl>Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. <nl>Evaluation of market segment<nl>With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this \u2018Under 22\u2019 bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 \u2013 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher\u2019s fairs should focus on the \u2018Under 22\u2019 package as this is most relevant to first year students.<nl><nl><nl>Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city.<nl>This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success.<nl>Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel.<nl><nl>Positioning<nl>As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost.<nl>To identify Car Club\u2019s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. <nl>Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers\u2019 initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people.<nl><figure><nl>If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of \u00a33.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around \u00a32.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It\u2019s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. <nl>Sixt and Avis start at \u00a351 (Sixt 2020) and \u00a360 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of \u00a336day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs.<nl>The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club\u2019s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility.<nl>In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success.<nl><figure><nl>Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team!<nl>The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club\u2019s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category.<nl><nl>Car Club\u2019s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so.<nl>From Car Club\u2019s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham.<nl><figure><nl>Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives.<nl><nl>Campaign Objectives<nl>1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population)<nl>As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham\u2019s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher\u2019s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club\u2019s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention.<nl><nl>2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher\u2019s fairs within the city<nl>Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users\u2019 involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. <nl><nl>Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools<nl>The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming.<nl>Push strategy \u2013 Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student\u2019s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise\u2019s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors.<nl><nl>Pull strategy \u2013 This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers\u2019 minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness.<nl>As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers\u2019 positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion.<nl><nl>Marketing tools plan<nl>Personal selling<nl>Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication \u2026 in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy \u2026 a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers\u2019 presence on campus at  fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club\u2019s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. <nl><nl>Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use.<nl>Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise\u2019s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. <nl>Testing<nl>Personal sellers\u2019 ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher\u2019s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the  venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data.<nl>Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments.<nl><nl>Advertising<nl>Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication \u2026 designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS\u2019 lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that  \"77%\u00a0of students are using Instagram, and\u00a075%\u00a0are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club\u2019s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students\u2019 social-media usage whilst remaining affordable.<nl>Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness.<nl><nl>Integration of marketing communications <nl>Enterprise\u2019s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 as they are socially active \u2018communaholics\u2019, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide.<nl>Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company\u2019s market position and standing by Enterprise\u2019s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service.<nl>The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online.<nl><nl>Implementation plan<nl>Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April \u2013 Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops.<nl>Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn\u2019t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "positive": " Dad!

{"anchor": "Employee relations is a socio-economic exchange between employer and employee with an agreement set regarding the latter\u2019s labour power and capacity to work. (Blyton, Turnbull 2004) Employment relations examines and analyses the various dimensions of this employee-employer relationship. The impact of employee relations has a huge impact on the UK as there are approximately 32.6 million people (ONS, November 2020) employed in the country. <nl>Government as a body plays a central role in employment relations to meet the economic and social goals of the country. The Government, who help to shape and intervene with employment relations have continually formulated new regulations and laws which affect all parties of the employment relations. One of the roles Government has always held is economic manager, they are assigned to plan and manage national economic activities (Kaul, 1997) and deal with policies at both the macro and micro level, ensuring that the labour markets operates well. (Cowling, Mitchell 1997) The Government itself is an employer, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported in June 2019, there were 5.42 million people employed in the UK\u2019s public sector, accounting for 16.5% of all those in paid work. <nl><nl>Gender equality is a worldwide issue, statistics show there have always been more men than women in the labor market. In 1971, 52.8% was the female employment rate in comparison to 92.1% of their counterpart. The gap has reduced drastically with figures from 2020 showing a female employment rate of 72.1% and a male employment rate of 78.4% (ONS), a reduction in difference of over 30%. Though the UK\u2019s statistics have improved massively, the council of foreign relations ranked the country 7th on women\u2019s economic participation around the world, ranking behind other western countries such as Australia and Canada. Though in the time since 1971, there has been massive developments in gender equality in the workplace, when comparing to the rest of the world we can see the UK has a lot of catching up to do to provide women the same economic opportunities as their male counterparts. This report will emphasize the UK Governments intervention on gender equality and the overall impact of this on the economy and employee relations. <nl>Introduction of new legislation by the UK in employment relations has been one of the interventions which has helped to improve the gender gap in the UK. The Equal Pay Act (1970) and the Sex Discrimination Act (1975) were revolutionary legislations which opened a door for women in the workplace; the two legislations helped the minority gender and stated that employers must ensure that there is no sex discrimination, direct or indirect. In 2002, Blair\u2019s Labour party introduced the right to request flexible working which would facilitate both work and caring responsibilities for women. The change continued with different Governments and in 2010 the Labour Government introduced the Equality act which focused on \u2018building a fairer Britain\u2019 and brought together previous anti-discrimination laws, into one single legislation. When addressing gender quality on International women\u2019s day, Boris Johnson stated that there is \u2018so much more to do to ensure gender equality\u2019 making us aware that the Government has and will continue to authorize different legislations to ensure that inequality is reduced from the workplace and instead, equality is made apparent. <nl><nl>Participation of women in the UK labour market is increasing year on year; though the labour market remains dominated by men, the difference in the gap between men and women has reduced. In the first quartile of 2010, there was a female employment rate of women aged 16-64 of 65.6%, whilst the male employment rate for the same quartile was 74.9%, a difference of 9.3%. In comparison, in the first quarter of 2020, ONS reported 72.6% of women were in work whilst 79.8% of males were employed, a difference of 7.2%. The difference in the gap in between employment rates has seen over a 2% decrease in the past decade, with 2020 reporting the lowest data recorded.  Women employment rate is at the highest it has ever been, despite the job loss consequences of the covid-19 pandemic which has seen many lose their job. A national survey named the Women and Employment survey, which interviewed 5588 women between the ages of 16-59 in the 1980\u2019s produced key findings including evidence that though women returned to work after having children, it modified their lifetime earnings drastically with data showing that if a women was to have two children, it would reduce her lifetime earnings by roughly half than if she had remained childless. (Martin, Roberts 2006) In the past few decades, we have seen that working mothers are able to balance both their work and home life, and having a job provides them with stimulation, and better feelings of themselves (Poduval and Poduval 2009). Few reasons why there has been an increase of mothers in the workforce is due to the forming of new legislations and regulations by the Government including but not limited to the Shared Parental Leave 2014 and the lone parent income and support and Equality act 2010. These have helped women to feel better represented and led to positive effects on women employment and bringing in women into the workplace, allowing them to juggle their career and their families. Change in state pension age has also had an impact on the rise of women in employment; older women will stay in work for longer than previous years; for them it will provide \u2018financial independence\u2019 and an \u2018opportunity to save for retirement\u2019 (Thompson, 2020) <nl>The recession in 2008 saw both men and women being made redundant leading to an overall decrease in employment; women faired better in this decrease though due to their form of employment. Although numbers of full-time women in employment decreased, there was an incline of workers in part-time positions with employment rates in the public sector areas of education and health, where women are more heavily represented seeing a growth of 300,000 jobs between 2008 and 2009 (Rubery and Raggerty, 2013) During the recession, organisations used the method of labour market flexibility; markets responded to the changing economic conditions by making their full-time employees redundant whilst recruiting additional part-time workers to decrease working costs whilst having employees still produce the same levels of work; many women took advantage of the opportunity and so we didn\u2019t see numbers of part-time female employment reduce. The Government permitted this labour market flexibility to continue to take the country\u2019s market back to steadiness (Bell and Blenchflower, 2010). To help support people get back into work; the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) introduced the Future Jobs Fund (FJF) in 2009 hoping to create jobs for those disadvantaged. By 2012, we saw the economy start to improve again but in the four years before this, in such challenging times, the Government should have looked to create interventions and ways to support all those who had been affected by the recession.<nl>Though there is the issue of more men in work then women, gender pay gap is another key problem in gender inequality. In April 2019, the Office of National Statistics reported a gender pay gap of 17.4%, stating that in higher positions, there was a much larger difference in pay between the two genders compared to lower paid positions. When women enter the Labour market in low paid jobs, they are seen to rarely progress up, instead in a \u2018sticky floor\u2019 position, for men though, these jobs are seen as \u2018springboards\u2019 for them into higher paid positions. Government intervention in the form of legislations and policies help to reduce this dichotomy; the introduction of the flexible working act in 2014 and the Children and Family act (2014) meant that women could balance their families and responsibilities they have out of work. The flexible working act however stated that employees only have the right to request a change in working times after completing 26 weeks of employment. The Hampden Alexander review, supported by the Government set a minimum 33% target for women on the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 boards and the two divisions of leadership below this who would publish annual reports on gender pay gap too. Olsen et al (2018) found that women who do part time work tend to have higher quality jobs then men who work part time but that in the Labour market history, a driver for the pay gap, there was a 56% difference in the way men and women participate, 43.6% of this accounted for by the fact that men usually have a lot more experience in working full-time than women. According to equal pay act 2010, organisations had to publish six calculations including the mean and median gender pay gap in hourly pay every year (EHRC, 2020). In 2015, this voluntary reporting was made mandatory, however till today, this report publishing is not completely affective, in 2019, the equality human rights commission wrote to 47 organisations to make them aware formal investigations will begin due to their failure of reporting. Though the Law requires all organisations to report the gender pay gap, there is no requirement to reduce the pay gap, and though through the years we\u2019ve seen gender pay gap slowly start to decrease, it is still very much apparent. The Civil Service itself, reported a gender pay gap of 11.1% in 2019, showing us that the issue is apparent, even in the public sector. The Government should have ensured that the policies they passed effected the sectors that they control and reduced completely the gender pay gap for those in such roles, this way other companies would have followed from a long time ago. <nl><nl>The Government has established a few interventions to help control gender inequality. The introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1998 meant all workers would be paid a certain amount for the work they performed. The 2016 National Living Wage (NLW) added to this but specifically for those over 25; the introduction of both meant that women, who were traditionally always paid lower than men would be entitled to the same minimum wage. Personnel today predicted in 2015 that the introduction of the NLW would mean that 13 of female workers would receive a pay rise by the end of the decade due to the policy. Another intervention introduced was the establishment of the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2007 (EHRC) which saw to protect people\u2019s rights and ensure fairness and equality; the Government provides funding for the company and works with it when progressing human rights. EHRC has helped millions of people since it was started up but in 2016 saw devastating cuts to its funding, its 2007 budget of \u00a370million was to be cut down to an estimated \u00a318million in 2020. This lack of funding and decreased budget would have very negative consequences on gender inequality; EHRC would not be able to function as broadly as it did before, equality would not be monitored and maintained as efficiently as previous years.<nl>In the UK, the State has passed legislations and regulations in the hope to bring about gender equality. They have also established different bodies to help combat this. The equality act 2010, though one of the most important legislations to help bring about diversity and equality in the workplace, 10 years on, still sees significant gaps in employment of men and women. The gender pay gap which has been slowly decreasing, sees a higher pay gap between the two genders in more senior roles; discouraging women to try and climb up company ladders. Government should have stricter rules on closing the gender pay gap not only in lower paid roles but higher ones too, encouraging women to be ambitious in themselves. An introduction for a NLW for more vulnerable women such as single mothers should be introduced as they may struggle than most with the set NLW, better flexible working arrangements should also be made possible in all types of organisations, not just after a 26 weeks\u2019 tenure. There should also be stricter repercussions on business\u2019 which fail to report their gender pay gaps as a few not following guidelines could see knock-on effects on other organisations doing the same. Though the Government is doing much to fight gender inequality, as a lawmaker, manager of economy and an employer, it has a long way to go to completely diminish the issue.", "positive": "<addr10_FN>,<nl><nl>I have a meeting with yourself tomorrow at 12:00 but something has come up and I won\u2019t be able to make it.

{"anchor": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs \u00a3157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a caf\u00e9. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a caf\u00e9 to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Caf\u00e9 Kluuvikatu 3, caf\u00e9 which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too. Furthermore, i found a live music bar for my CEO to visit, called Storyville, Helsinki. this offers food, alongside live music band, piano room and dance floor which seems very entertaining.", "positive": "<addr1_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you for letting me know.

{"anchor": "This strategy paper will focus on suggesting realistic solutions to the problem of educational gender inequality in India. This inequality is a clear problem; unequal access to education is an infringement of human rights. If this gender disparity was lessened, the well-being and development of children would be positively impacted, as well as the economy of the country itself (Fuller, 2019). To tackle this issue, proposed strategies could take the form of implementing new legislative reforms that aid families in the struggles they face, as well as reforming teaching throughout India in order to help eradicate damaging cultural and social norms. The paper will begin by firstly explaining the main problems within the education sector in India and will then highlight the importance of achieving gender equality in education. The main body of the paper will entail a detailed analysis of the current strategies and legislation in place as well as non-governmental reforms made by different organisations. The paper will then move towards a focus on the suggested strategies that could be incorporated into the current education system to alleviate gender inequalities and will be compared to the successes of educational reform in Sweden. This will include a description of the targets for the reforms, instruments to aid reform, and the target groups at which reforms are aimed at. The paper will conclude with a summary of the findings from this research and ways to ensure the successful implementation of new strategies.  <nl>Why is this a problem?<nl>There are two primary factors that can limit the education of girls in India: cultural traditions and poverty. In terms of cultural traditions, there are several reasons that this issue can play a significant role in the educational disparity between genders. Firstly, the miseducation of parents about the importance of schools for girls and the costings of education itself thus leads to families becoming reluctant to educate girls within the household. Research shows that parents are more willing to send their girls to school if they had access to more information about school (Maertens, 2011). Furthermore, it is said that gender discrimination within household expenditure and education has resulted in the inadequate progress of educating of women in many countries across the world, and thus ingrains this issue into the societal framework of such countries (Saha, 2013). This is also reinforced by the low literacy rates in India. The correlation between low literacy rates among men and women indicates that the miseducation of parents can affect the education of girls because they themselves have had inadequate education, and it is difficult for them to understand the importance of it, further highlighting the gender inequalities between men and women through previous social norms. For example, the 2011 literacy rates of women were 57.93% compared to men which were 77.15% (Pathania, 2020) demonstrating gender disparities and how poverty can be a factor in gender inequalities within education. Poverty plays an important role in the lack of education for girls. Daughters from families that face social pressures to get married are more likely to only complete minimum education, as shown in a study of three rural villages in India, where only 39% of girls were allowed by their parents to pursue higher education, compared to the 71% of boys who would go into further education (Maertens, 2013). Furthermore, educating women is not prioritised in the household as it stops the income that would otherwise be earned from girls going straight into work rather than staying in school. Therefore, working and earning can be seen to be put on a pedestal instead for the many families facing financial difficulties (Hebert, 2020).<nl>Why is this an important issue for gender equality?<nl>As UNICEF has stated, the educational advancement of girls is the most effective way of combatting challenges to human development, so it is important to expand educational access and overcome cultural norms to achieve this (Ross, Shah &amp; Wang, 2011). Inequalities within education are important to the issue of gender equality, as even though India emerges as one of the top three countries for higher education (Bazaz &amp; Akram, 2020), in certain states such as Uttar Pradesh, only 33.20% of women are educated compared to the 73.40% of men who are educated, highlighting that there are severe problems within the education system that disadvantage women. Furthermore, this can lead to other problems such as a gender gap in the labour market, as if employers value a woman\u2019s education less than that of a man\u2019s, and therefore there are fewer economic incentives to educate women, which subsequently affects the economy and the wellbeing of women (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Another factor that makes this issue important is that the education of girls further reduces the risks they face, such as abuse and child marriage, as currently, a third of child brides worldwide are in India (Sahni, 2018). Moreover, better education for girls reduces the risks of child labour in poorer families to ensure the survival of their households, as the hourly wages of a child with higher school education are 8.97% higher compared to a child with no schooling, leading to less exploitation (Chamarbagwala, 2008). <nl>Attempted strategies to achieve gender equality in education<nl>There have been many attempts in India to close the gender gaps in education, through both legal and social means. The main legislative reform introduced was the Right to Education Act in 2009, in which, all children between 6 and 14 years of age are required to complete primary school education. This reform has proven successful as enrolment between 2013-14 increased from 43.8% to 48.2% (Sahni, 2018). However, its success still proves limited on the gender equality front as a UNESCO report detailed that of the 95% of children who attended primary school, only 40% continued onto secondary education, in which, a small fraction of the 40% were girls (Modi, 2017). Attempts have also been made to reform the curriculum. However, this failed due to the response of disadvantaged schools towards the issue of gender equality: an attempt was made to create a new system where boys of different abilities were paired with girls, but this meant the educational interests of girls were sacrificed, therefore showing little to no development in changing gender inequalities in schools (Charlton, 2007).<nl>Secondly, a non-legislative reform that was made to combat gender inequality in education was the KGBV programme introduced in 2004. The goal of the programme was to increase children\u2019s, and in particular girls, access to the curriculum and to improve teaching standards. This began successfully as two Indian states partnered with CARE India (a non-governmental organisation) to introduce KGBV schools that were single-sex and employ a non-traditional curriculum. The KGBV school initiative was shown to be successful as they were more inclusive than state schools, as children of all castes could attend, which also allowed the new schools challenged harmful social norms. However, the success was limited as the KGBV programme did not focus on education above seventh grade where school dropout rates for girls are the highest (Shah, 2015).<nl>Finally, the most successful attempt at improving gender inequality in education was by ANK, a non-profit organisation with an aim to empower girls. ANK set up in 10 rural villages and introduced several initiatives for girls including: bicycle banks in 2002 to improve access to schools for girls, a life skills education programme out of school hours, a scholarship programme, and a karate programme. The implementation of these programmes showed great promise as 1,100 girls achieved a scholarship and 1,000 girls were given access to bikes. It was found that the combination of the bicycle bank and the life skills education programme led to the best education outcomes for girls. However, the bicycle bank programme was discontinued and this programme only reached a small number of girls, so, nationally, gender disparities remained high (Modi, 2017).<nl>Proposed Strategies<nl>My first proposed strategy is to subsidise costs for school by 50% for low-income families; as mentioned above, many parents selectively choose their male children to attend school rather than their female children, because of financial difficulties. Therefore, subsidising the costs of schooling can enable equal opportunities for girls. This has proved successful in countries such as Sweden, where pre-schooling costs have been subsidised for lower-income families, in order to equalise opportunities for all and ensure substantial educational attainment for both males and females (Bjorklund, Clark, Edin, Fredricksson &amp; Krueger, 2006). Success can be seen clearly when compared to India, a large 79% of the students go on to secondary school in Sweden (European Commission, 2017) against a mere 40% in India, in which, the ratio of boys to girls is equal in Sweden unlike in India (Modi, 2017).<nl>Additionally, another legislative reform that could be introduced is to improve families\u2019 access to daycare and after school care, so that parents can work, alleviating any stresses on children providing additional household income. A similar policy proved successful in Sweden (Sweden, 2020), in which a right to daycare was introduced in the 1990s for working parents to alleviate financial pressure (Fritzell, Hvinden, Kautto, Kvist &amp; Uusitalo, 2001). Furthermore, there has been evidence to suggest that altering the way teachers are trained helps to promote gender equality and eradicate bias in the classroom. In a proposed system called REFLECT, teachers are given criteria that they must meet, including creating a suitable learning environment for female and male children - this could prove beneficial in India (Kollmayer, 2020).<nl>The next proposed strategy is an extension of the work of ANK with the bicycle banks and life skills education programme (Modi, 2017) as it proved successful but stopped due to a lack of funding. This would enable a focus on the education of girls and give them access to adequate teaching, which in turn reaps enormous benefits economically, socially, and mentally, especially in terms of the wellbeing of girls in India. It would also help to elevate the goal of India to become more gender-inclusive, as currently, their progress for gender equality remains slow and they stand at a ranking of 132 out of 187 countries (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Sequentially, to enable parents of girls to realise the importance of education, it is vital to recruit them as allies in the movement against gender inequalities in education. To do this, parents\u2019 evenings could be introduced for teachers to educate parents in schooling and other matters that put girls at risk such as child marriage. Research shows that parents evenings are important in the development of a child and important for the parents themselves as they are responsible for making key decisions that impact the future of their children (Fefer, 2020), highlighting how this can also be a way to communicate the positive prospects for girls with the aid of education. <nl>To conclude, it is prevalent that actions must be taken within education legislation and within the households of girls to combat the problem of gender inequality within education. The government must take steps to support families of lower incomes so as to ensure no one is denied equal opportunity to education. This will reduce child labour rates, increase literacy rates, and improve India\u2019s ranking on the gender equality index, as well as increasing the economic status of many civilians in India. With the increased education of girls, it will help to combat harmful social norms in the future, preventing young girls from the fate of child marriage, abuse, and exploitation. With reforms in teaching, they could allow for long-lasting changes within education, as it means they can be the main drivers for change within schools. This, combined with the added aid of regular parents\u2019 evenings, allows for teachers to become catalysts in changing negative social attitudes towards gender equality concerns that strategies like these will remain only partially effective. For example, India was one of 52 countries that refused to comply with Article 5 of the UN sustainable development goals which states that \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" (United Nations, 2020). Without the support of the government, gender equality may not be valued. However, this can be counteracted by the implementation and enforcement of new laws, starting within the education sector, to allow women and young girls to become more independent and assert themselves within society.", "positive": "now right!!!!

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. <nl>Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. <nl>Evaluation of market segment<nl>With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this \u2018Under 22\u2019 bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 \u2013 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher\u2019s fairs should focus on the \u2018Under 22\u2019 package as this is most relevant to first year students.<nl><nl><nl>Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city.<nl>This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success.<nl>Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel.<nl><nl>Positioning<nl>As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost.<nl>To identify Car Club\u2019s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. <nl>Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers\u2019 initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people.<nl><figure><nl>If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of \u00a33.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around \u00a32.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It\u2019s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. <nl>Sixt and Avis start at \u00a351 (Sixt 2020) and \u00a360 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of \u00a336day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs.<nl>The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club\u2019s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility.<nl>In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success.<nl><figure><nl>Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team!<nl>The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club\u2019s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category.<nl><nl>Car Club\u2019s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so.<nl>From Car Club\u2019s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham.<nl><figure><nl>Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives.<nl><nl>Campaign Objectives<nl>1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population)<nl>As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham\u2019s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher\u2019s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club\u2019s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention.<nl><nl>2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher\u2019s fairs within the city<nl>Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users\u2019 involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. <nl><nl>Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools<nl>The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming.<nl>Push strategy \u2013 Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student\u2019s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise\u2019s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors.<nl><nl>Pull strategy \u2013 This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers\u2019 minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness.<nl>As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers\u2019 positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion.<nl><nl>Marketing tools plan<nl>Personal selling<nl>Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication \u2026 in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy \u2026 a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers\u2019 presence on campus at  fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club\u2019s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. <nl><nl>Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use.<nl>Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise\u2019s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. <nl>Testing<nl>Personal sellers\u2019 ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher\u2019s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the  venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data.<nl>Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments.<nl><nl>Advertising<nl>Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication \u2026 designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS\u2019 lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that  \"77%\u00a0of students are using Instagram, and\u00a075%\u00a0are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club\u2019s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students\u2019 social-media usage whilst remaining affordable.<nl>Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness.<nl><nl>Integration of marketing communications <nl>Enterprise\u2019s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 as they are socially active \u2018communaholics\u2019, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide.<nl>Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company\u2019s market position and standing by Enterprise\u2019s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service.<nl>The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online.<nl><nl>Implementation plan<nl>Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April \u2013 Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops.<nl>Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn\u2019t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "positive": "<addr23_FN>,<nl><nl>Apologies for wasting your time, my groupmate was able to find backups of the photos in the cloud from his phone so we have a solution!
