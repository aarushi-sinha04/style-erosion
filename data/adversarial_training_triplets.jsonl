{"id": "aug_1", "anchor": "Introduction Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. Evaluation of market segment With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this \u2018Under 22\u2019 bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 \u2013 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher\u2019s fairs should focus on the \u2018Under 22\u2019 package as this is most relevant to first year students. Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city. This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success. Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel. Positioning As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost. To identify Car Club\u2019s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers\u2019 initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people. If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of \u00a33.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around \u00a32.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It\u2019s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. Sixt and Avis start at \u00a351 (Sixt 2020) and \u00a360 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of \u00a336day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs. The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club\u2019s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility. In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success. Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team! The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club\u2019s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category. Car Club\u2019s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so. From Car Club\u2019s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham. Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives. Campaign Objectives 1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population) As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham\u2019s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher\u2019s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club\u2019s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention. 2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher\u2019s fairs within the city Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users\u2019 involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming. Push strategy \u2013 Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student\u2019s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise\u2019s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors. Pull strategy \u2013 This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers\u2019 minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness. As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers\u2019 positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion. Marketing tools plan Personal selling Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication \u2026 in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy \u2026 a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers\u2019 presence on campus at fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club\u2019s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use. Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise\u2019s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. Testing Personal sellers\u2019 ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher\u2019s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data. Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments. Advertising Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication \u2026 designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS\u2019 lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that \"77% of students are using Instagram, and 75% are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club\u2019s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students\u2019 social-media usage whilst remaining affordable. Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness. Integration of marketing communications Enterprise\u2019s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 as they are socially active \u2018communaholics\u2019, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide. Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company\u2019s market position and standing by Enterprise\u2019s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service. The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online. Implementation plan Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April \u2013 Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops. Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn\u2019t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "positive": "ope so, Ive done 3 nights in a row now so I could do with the rest\ud83d\ude02that sounds like the best way to prepare for a lecture;) Did you wake up in time for it?x Have just remembered im meant to be out tonight too ffs\ud83d\ude02 I am very impressed you made that, i could never do that after a night out\ud83d\ude05 Its not very appealing rn if I'm honest;) Very true, especially if you don't even have to put the camera on\ud83d\ude1cxx Think I might have to have a little water first but after that, im sure youre right;) Damn you did well!

{"id": "aug_2", "anchor": "Introduction. This strategy paper will focus on combatting the maltreatment of house girls which indicates that gender inequality still exists, thus being perpetuated through the form of violence against women. The strategy will focus on passing laws to criminalise abusers and to formalise the industry by establishing policy surrounding working pay and overall job protection. This paper will begin by outlining background information surrounding the role of house girls and the challenges they face. The main body of the paper will then express the previous strategies used, as well as new strategies that can be implemented to alleviate the problem. This will be compared to the context of South African legislation to show their success in emulating such an issue. By including goals, theories and potential allies this paper will provide an effective solution to curve the rate of abuse towards house girls. Lastly the conclusion will end with summarising all of the findings that seek to combat the issue at hand. What is a house girl? According to Oxford dictionary, a house girl is \"defined as a female slave who works in a house (now historical); or any young female domestic servant or employee, especially in some former British dependencies. (Later)\" For centuries many women and girls have taken on domestic work in the role of domestic house girls as a means for escaping extreme poverty. This industry is normalised in less developed countries especially within Africa. In Nigeria, the most densely populated African country, house girls are particularly popular however due to the lack of workers\u2019 rights, desperation of employees and ineffective laws to protect workers, many girls are prone to maltreatment. This ranges from poor living conditions, sexual abuse and a lack of basic human rights as a whole. Causes of the problem. House girls in Nigeria are usually employed by upper- and middle-class families with disposable income to spare and girls as young as 10 start working in such roles. The fundamental reason why this practise is widespread is due to poverty, with \"females from low-income households expected to work, often to contribute to the economic sustenance of the family thus playing the role as the breadwinner\" (Nwaubani 2017). Many people from rural areas travel into main cities such as Lagos in search of better employment opportunities and means of livelihood. Furthermore, in Nigeria, there is a large disparity between the education level that boys and girls receive, with many girls failing to have access to adequate education past a certain age. This is exemplified through UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2015 where female adult literacy rates (ages 15 and above) in Nigeria was 59.4% in comparison to the male rate of 74.4%. This disparity is a main contributor to why many young women become house girls. Csapo, M (1981) explains how, in particular, in the northern region, Nigerian women are considered secondary citizens therefore education is not so much a priority. Parents, especially that of Muslim heritage are reluctant to send their girls to school due to fear of moral laxity from the westernised teachings. These customs and beliefs contribute to the disrespect women face whilst at work. The patriarchal society that Nigeria operates on further opens up doors for abuse this is exemplified through feminist theory which view \"oppression of women and patriarchal privilege as a mechanism for violence against women\" (Napikoski 2020). Women who seek to become house girls at whatever educational level should be given the same rights as any other worker. Furthermore, many house girls lack a job with good working conditions and security due to the lack of labour laws being enforced. This under- the-radar market allows for women to work under exhausting conditions subject to poor pay and long hours and constant insults from their employers. Girls who work for over 8 hours a day are significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted due to the time spent at work being greater. Media platforms such as Nollywood also depict house girls as poor, needy and constantly faced with maltreatment. This depiction exemplifies itself in reality. The maltreatment of house girls is also compounded by the fact that the house girl industry is currently informal. There are no regulations and requirements for any worker thus many women remain at the mercy of their boss, simply leaving women vulnerable to crime and exploitative employment. Children who are a part of this informal sector are especially at risk of sexual exploitation creating long term problems such as unwanted pregnancies and psychosocial trauma. (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 2019) Domestic slavery makes $18 billion alone in Africa and entry into this informal economy has significantly increased in recent times, the house girl economy thrives because of ready availability of services for the market. This in turn cuts through all necessary checks and procedures which protect female workers. Employers further defend themselves by saying these girls are better off working in homes, rather than on the street. Due to this industry occurring in people\u2019s private household, boundaries between the public and private sphere and the states involvement becomes hard to cross, nevertheless, this is an issue that must be addressed as it is an infringement on human rights and these unfortunate experiences truly manifest themselves in the everyday life of women. Previous strategies. Pressure from outsider groups have called for the police and government to protect female workers including house girls due to the trafficking they are prone to. In 2004, the Nigerian government created the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), an anti-trafficking agency, designed to tackling trafficking. Between 2003-2017, they were successful in recovering over 3000 victims. Furthermore in 2015 Nigeria altered their trafficking laws to elevate penalties for offenders and criminalise those who employed children under 12 in domestic labour. Whilst human rights activists such as The National Human Rights Commission, work with the police and NAPTIP to secure prosecutions and provide shelter and aid for victims, the issue still persists. At present there are national legislative inconsistencies towards the minimum age to work (2015 US Labour Department report). The Child Rights Act prohibits those under 18 from working yet the Labour Act sets the minimum age of employment at 12. This elucidates the inconsistency of the legislative system in protecting female workers. Ultimately this ambiguousness needs to be removed or amended in order to tackle violence against house girls. Proposed strategies 1. Registration of employees. Providing domestic help is not the main cause of abuse as across countries, where there is less domestic abuse, this is seen with the likes of au-pairs, nannies, maids etc. such as in the UK. Chinelo Ezenwaadding, a female rights activist, claims \"the house help industry can be a positive thing because you get to help others, but it should be regulated and there should be laws governing the treatment of maids.\" Therefore, by establishing employment policy standards we can reach a greater environment for workers and tackle violence cases. I believe this is the most utilitarian approach. In Nigeria, there is a high number of house girls that have not been recognised as official workers, thus feed into the informal economy. This presents several problems and avoidable situations such as limited accessibility to any legal rights if needed. \"The informal economy represents a multi\u2010facetted and spatially diverse phenomenon\" (Fajana 2008). However, through regulation of this informal work, advantages will arise such as industrial peace and order. Therefore, every female of the legal working age needs to be put on a governmental system acknowledging house girls as established employees. Workers must be registered in order to start working providing this switch from an informal to formal sector will reduce the chances of maltreatment through ending under aged workers and exploitation towards females. Accountability for any unethical matters can be upheld and under-the-radar crimes which were once hard to record can now be accounted for. By implementing this policy the economy will be regulated and VAW reduced. 2. Establishing a living minimum wage. The Capitalist Entrepreneurial Theory (Schumpeter 1942) aims to give an explanation behind inequality and poverty claiming \"the payment of meagre wage rates, as well as unfair, poor and irritating working conditions, are means of exploiting the masses of workers and excessive, illustrating the constant cycle of poverty for these working women\". However this needs to be dismantled through giving a basic living salary that workers can survive on and is fairly reflected through the work they do. According to Naira Land Forum, \"house girls are paid from as little as 15,000 to 30,000 naira equating to \u00a329.64-59.27 a month\". This contradicts with the monthly cost of living, which according to Statisais, is 43,000 naira thus illustrating how female workers are prone to no personal growth opportunities. Many of these women have economic responsibilities leaving them no choice but to work even for a minimum wage. Poverty is a primary risk factor that renders women and girls vulnerable to sex trafficking\" (PJI 2018) \"The growing labour force of this informal sector means that informal economy workers accept wages below the legal minimum levels\" (Anyanwu, 1994) this effects house girls, which in essence means that employment contacts between both employee and employer must be established, setting out hours of work and legal workers\u2019 pay . This will reduce any form of financial abuse and studies imply that the best approach to lessen violence against women is to combine economic empowerment and gender equity efforts. This must be made universal for all working women and government must intervene to enabling this is established. England has successfully demonstrated this with implementing contracts for au- pairs which state clear agreements on provisions regarding regulated working hours and pay. Nigeria must adapt this same approach to allow for female emancipation. 3. Establishing a skills workshop. A weak to non-existent system for protecting children from abuse is prevalent across Nigeria (Santos Pais 2014) A community based approach, which doesn\u2019t allow the lack of education to be a hindrance to one\u2019s progression, is an essential tool towards female independence. Through providing government funded, free access to vocational skills for house girl who have been abused, this safe space will equip females with a broad set of skills to prepare them for another job sector. This differs from conventional shelters in that it re-trains females -emphasising the importance of rehabilitation to go back into the world of work thus enabling them to generate income to sustain themselves and their families. This approach can be further recognised through government coalition -working with local churches and charities to bring awareness to this cause. 4. Legal reform. South African legislators have showed commitment to addressing violence against women through passing the Domestic Violence Act in 1998 which introduced minimum sentences for rape and tightened bail requirements for those accused of rape. Through establishing a new Ministry for Women, Children and Persons with Disability this further denotes commitment to combatting violence against women and seeked to go against the cultural norms towards violence against women especially within private households were proof of abuse was often difficult obtain. As a result, significant contributions consisted of an increased conviction rate and a decrease in rape cases. \"In Nigeria among women aged 15\u201349 who have survived physical or sexual violence, 45% never got help or told anyone about the experience\" (NPC and ICF International 2014).Therefore the same legal and effective approaches must be taken by Nigerian policy makers to protect the rights of female house girls with potential threats that they could be faced with. A safe haven must be created for house girls who have been victimised thus providing severe consequences for criminals who perform and assist in abusing house girls. This unequivocally will drive down the cases of abuse. Structurally, a national framework protecting house girls from abuse should be established across Nigeria. Law enforcement officers are fundamentally necessary at the frontline of the criminal justice system. Their attitude and response towards violence against house girls can have a dramatic impact on ensuring the prevention of future violent acts and that the protection of victims are upheld. Violence against women and girls cannot be fought by women alone. Thus, law enforcement officers must be adequately trained and compensated so that they willing to do their jobs diligently. A South African project in 2000 successfully provided resources for facilitators to train prosecutors working in the area of VAW. This highlights that through time, investment and attitudinal changes Government efforts can be effective. Conclusion. To conclude a strategy which focuses on legislative and humanitarian goals is crucial in reducing the rates of abuse. In co-operation with the Nigerian government the strategies presented in this paper will improve the standard of living for house girls and provide a modernised criminal justice system in which justice can be ratified if any women has been treated unfairly. It will also push house girls out of poverty alleviation and give women the tools to gain workers freedom, a concept that should be universal for all house girls across the globe. Ultimately the maltreatment of house girls in Nigeria is challenging to dismantle but efficient implementations of these proposed tactics will combat the maltreatment of house girls in Nigeria.", "positive": "Lapland hotel Bulevardi- a 5 star hotel for \u00a3405 for the 2 nights including breakfast. it is 1,600 yards from the beach.

{"id": "aug_7", "anchor": "The question to what extent to which English Laws general hostility towards good faith in commercial contracts is justifiable within the modern day has been subjected to disapproval by some judges. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd Bingham L.J. noted that \u2018in many legal systems outside the common law world, the law of obligations recognises and enforces an overriding principle that in making and carrying out contracts parties should act in good faith\u2019 but English law has decided not to adopt a good faith obligation but rather \u2018developed piecemeal solutions in response to demonstrated problems of unfairness.\u2019 The courts in England are more concerned with commercial certainty rather than parties being just towards one another. This essay will argue that the hostility towards good faith obligations within commercial contracts cannot be justified in the modern day and that there should be a good faith principle introduced in English Law. It will begin by discussing the current law in relation to good faith and explain how an overriding principle of good faith will be beneficial to the parties in commercial contracts. It will then suggest the reasons why in this day and age it is important for there to be an obligation of good faith within commercial contracts and give examples of the English law\u2019s current recognition of implied and express good faith obligations. Finally, it will look at the general principles of the UK courts such as party autonomy and commercial certainty and explore how they can still be preserved with an obligation of good faith. Good faith is the notion that those within contracts will act fairly towards one another. They will \u2018put all their cards face upwards on the table\u2019 and trade in a way that is open and fair. Traditionally good faith is not an overriding principle in English Law as the courts prefer for there to be certainty within commercial contracts as opposed to fairness. They are particularly against imposing broad good faith obligations. The reasons for this include the fact that it can cause uncertainty because if there was an obligation to act in good faith this can sometimes go against what the terms of the contract include. The parties can usually only go to court if one party does not fulfil their end of the contract. Furthermore, good faith can be seen as subjective as every person will have a different view of what good faith is and sometimes one judge may go too far and start siding with one party which would cause the other party a loss and so it would be difficult to find a middle point where it is suitable for both parties to not be at a complete loss. Another reason as to why the English courts prefer not to have a good faith obligation is because it makes them a lot more attractive to global businesses since they are one of the main countries without a good faith obligation. This allows for those wanting to get into commercial contracts to be more certain about the outcomes if anything was to go wrong. English law also prefers for there to be party autonomy as it allows both parties to be able to choose which law will govern their contract. This allows for an enhanced level of certainty and predictability because both parties will be able to choose which laws best suit them. The parties also have freedom of contract which gives each party the freedom to enter into a contract and decide what terms to include. Rather than an actual good faith principal English law prefers to adopt piecemeal solutions which are used for certain situations where it is seen as necessary. These will usually arise in fiduciary relationships, contracts of insurance and contracts of partnerships and employment. These include contractual interpretation where the courts will look at the intention of the parties rather than a strict interpretation of the words used in the contract. Another instance where the courts might decide to use piecemeal solutions is when an unfair act amounts to promissory estoppel. Misrepresentation is another example where the courts might use piecemeal solutions. In some contracts such as ones where fiduciary duties are assumed there is a duty to consider the other party\u2019s interests. The party assuming the fiduciary duties will be obligated to not act dishonestly and cannot allow their interests to clash with those of their principle. Within the terms of a contract a party is allowed to include an express term to act or negotiate in good faith. This will mean both parties will have to act and negotiate in good faith and the courts will uphold this term as it is written in the contract if it is breached by either party. In Berkeley Community Villages Ltd v Pullen, it was held that an agreement would be enough to create a contractual obligation for the parties to act in good faith. This approach was also used in CPC Group Ltd v Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co by Vos J. who stated that \u2018the obligation of utmost good faith in the [contract]was to adhere to the spirit of the contract \u2026. And to observe reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, in the shortest possible time, and to be faithful to the agreed common purpose, and to act consistently with the justified expectations of the parties.\u2019 There is an increased amount of recognition for express terms to act in good faith in commercial contracts and many judges will uphold the term because their concern is ensuring the terms of the contract are not breached. This means that if a party wants a good faith obligation in their contract then they just have to include one as a term of the contract but if the other party does not want a goof faith obligation imposed on them then it can cause some issues for the parties as it could be assumed that the other party may not have the intention to act fairly and that is the reason why they don\u2019t want a good faith obligation in the contract. However, if there was a good faith obligation then this would ensure that both the parties have to act fairly towards one another which would almost eliminate the party\u2019s having bad intentions entering the contract as they know if they act upon their bad intentions then they will have to face the consequences in court. In the past there has been attempts by judges to introduce a good faith principle that extends to all contracts. In 1766 Lord Mansfield declared that \u2018[t]he governing principle is applicable to all contracts and dealings. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain, from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. But either party may be innocently silent, as to grounds open to both, to exercise their judgment upon.\u2019 However this outlook did not last long as the courts favoured party autonomy and sanctity of contract more. It is useful for parties to have an express term to act in good faith in their contract as it would allow them to resolve a problem that might happen in the future using a good faith mechanism rather than use an expensive third-party tool. Having an express term to negotiate or act in good faith will allow parties to plan ahead in the event of an uncontrollable event happening such as the market crashing or an economic recession. In the event this does happen the parties will be able to discuss how they can continue to keep working with each other and how they will uphold their side of the agreement. It is becoming very common to find good faith clauses within contracts in the modern day which suggests that many people want to trade in good faith and would not be opposed to a good faith obligation as a lot of those in commercial contracts have willingly decided to include a good faith clause in their contracts. Good faith may sometimes be implied by law in certain contracts as a term that must be followed. It is often needed in order for the contract to run smoothly. It is not implied based upon the intentions of the parties, rather because of the contractual relationship between the two parties.The different types of contracts it can be implied in include employment contracts, contracts of sale and goodwill as well as partnerships and contracts with fiduciary duties. Another way good faith can be implied is through fact. This is done to give importance to the intention of the parties in the contract. It is often implied based on necessity and obviousness. The case of Yam Seng Pte v International Trade Corp Ltd was significant in discussing whether there was an implied obligation that both parties will act in good faith with each other. Lord Leggart J. had agreed that the terms in the contract were enough to imply good faith and he also argued in favour of \u2018the implication of a term requiring good faith in performance\u2019 not only in just relational contracts but most commercial contracts based on the expectations of both parties. The fact that English law already has many instances where it uses pockets of good faith proves that a good faith principle would prove to be useful for parties entering into a contract as it is already used in several types of contracts and contractual relations. Many other countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Australia have a good faith principle in place which means that it is possible for the United Kingdom to have one too without the worry of wondering how they will execute such a principle. Although, the English courts might argue that having an obligation of good faith will take away from the party\u2019s freedom of contract and party autonomy, this can be disputed with the fact that the Canadian Supreme Court has said \u2018the principle of good faith must be applied in a manner that is consistent with the fundamental commitments of the common law of contract which generally places great weight on the freedom of contracting parties to pursue their individual self-interest.\u2019 The English courts can follow a similar approach and apply the principle in a way that will still allow those in commercial contracts their contractual freedom whilst also ensuring that they deal in a way that is honest, fair and truthful to the other party. The introduction of a good faith obligation will allow parties to feel more reassured that if the other party was to act in bad faith towards them, then they will at least have support from the courts. The party who acted in bad faith would be required to give compensation to the other party in order to correct their wrongdoings. The English courts are already accepting of a good faith clause within contracts and also state that there is a duty to act in good faith in certain types of relationships. This suggests that they may be open to the idea of introducing a legally binding principle of good faith. The law has developed in regard to express terms to negotiate in good faith since the case of Walford v Miles where the House of Lords had stated that promises to negotiate or not sell were unenforceable and rejected that the opposing party were under an obligation to act in good faith. Lord Acknew has stated that \u2018a bare agreement to negotiate was not enforceable, as it lacked the necessary certainty. It was no more than an (unenforceable) \u2018agreement to agree\u2019. However, in Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras it was held that if there was an express term to negotiate in good faith then it is enforceable. Whilst Longmore LJ had expressed that there were three objections to negotiate in good faith, he also stated that these objections did not completely prevent enforceability. He claimed that the first objection had carried little weight because normally the express obligation would have been enforceable. The second objection would be difficult to determine as it is unlikely the courts will be able to decide when the breach of the term had amounted to good faith and unless fraud was involved then it is likely the court would not consider the other party had acted in bad faith. In regard to the third objection Longmore LJ stated it would be difficult to find out exactly how much loss had occurred as a result of the breach. The development in the law after both of these cases suggests that judges are more accepting of good faith clauses and they are not seen as unenforceable \u2018agreements to agree\u2019. The general view of judges in recent times agree with Longmore LJ and believe it would be \u2018quite wrong\u2019 for the courts to deem an express clause to negotiate in good faith as unenforceable. It can be argued that introducing a good faith principle will undermine party autonomy and freedom of contract, but this can be easily resolved by using a method of enforcement similar to Canada when it comes to good faith. If the English courts enforce good faith, then they should limit the amount they get involved in order to preserve the freedom of parties. If the courts introduce a good faith clause then it should be \u2018capable of being given legal content\u2019. A good faith obligation would lead to fair dealing and less attempts of people acting in bad faith towards others. It would allow for more trust between parties as they will have more hope that it is unlikely the other party will act unfairly and unjustly towards them. In conclusion there should be a good faith principle introduced in English law as it will reassure those entering commercial contracts that if they were to enter a contract then the other party will have to act towards them in good faith and trade fairly with them. Parties can also be reassured that the courts would help them if the other party acted in bad faith towards them. There is also an increase in the amount of people in commercial contracts including clauses to act or negotiate in good faith towards one another. This proves that many people are going out of their way to include these clauses as it can be seen as a form of protection. Many international courts have a good faith obligation in place, and it does not take away from the freedom parties have, rather it enhances their security and lessens the chances of them being scammed. This is because the other party will less likely want to act in bad faith if they know the implications of their actions if taken to court. Whilst it is likely the courts will have some reservations or concerns towards a good faith obligation; they can look at how international courts implement the obligation. This will help them to keep a balance between doing too much or too little whilst maintaining the general principles of English commercial law.", "positive": "recruitment team Hello I completed a video application on the of and would like to know whether I was successful or not.

{"id": "aug_9", "anchor": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that is widely identified as having impairments on communication and behaviour. The DSM-V refers to social-emotional reciprocity deficits, difficulties in maintaining relationships and deficits in non-verbal communication as diagnostic criteria for Autism (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Memory functions are another aspect of autism that are talked about frequently, in particular, with executive functions (EF). Studies have shown that autistic individuals (AI) struggle with EF. For example, Bennetto et al. (1996) compared AI to individuals that suffer from frontal lobe brain lesions (extensively known for memory impairments) and found that they scored similarly on standardised EF tasks, showing an impairment on their executive functioning. It is important to note that this study was conducted with high-functioning AI so may not speak for all on the spectrum, nevertheless it has been a prominent study in the field of memory and AI. Regarding gathering evidence from autistic witnesses (AW), a few studies have looked at their performance on line-ups, but a lot of the research has focused on formal interviews. The Cognitive interview (CI) is an interview method that significantly improves the detail and accuracy of witness reports across various witness groups and is used highly in the US and UK (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). However, research by Maras and Bowler (2010) found that when conducting the CI on AI, they were less accurate on all sections of the CI compared to the control of typically developing (TD) matched adults. Further study results also suggest that it isn\u2019t an efficient method of interviewing AW, therefore I will list out a few recommendations that may improve evidence gathering from AW in an interview setting. One key aspect in conducting the CI or other enhanced interviews is the \u2018context reinstatement\u2019. Fisher and Geiselman (1992) stated that context reinstatement requires witnesses to mentally return to the incidentcrime for access to the cues that are representative of the incident context. However, for AW and AI this does not seem boost accuracy or recall but in fact reduce their accuracy and lead to reporting more incorrect details (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). One explanation for this is that AI struggle with episodic memory and the relational binding of events. Bowler et al. (2014) presented this as they conducted a study with autistic participants and TD participants where they viewed coloured drawings in a grid. In one condition, they were asked to recall either the item, colour, or location of the drawing and in the other condition, they were asked to recall the item and colour or the item and location. Results showed that participants with autism did significantly worse in the second condition on both trials. The findings suggest that AI show diminished relational binding compared to TD individuals. However, Solomon et al. (2016) suggested it may not be a relational binding problem but rather the excess use of cognitive functions. Solomon\u2019s study into memory involved autistic adolescents compared to Bowler\u2019s adults which could suggest age-specific differences regarding relational binding. Maras et al (2014) argued that the self-administered interview (SAI) combated the caveats for context reinstatement and the social aspect of the CI. The SAI was developed by Gabbert et al. (2009) to initially preserve the memory of the incidentcrime soon after it occurs. Maras et al. used the SAI with AW and despite the perceived benefits, it did not increase the rate of correct details recalled. However, one aspect of the SAI that they found to be useful was the Sketch component as autistic participants found it easier to recall more details with drawing in relation to the event. Maras et al. suggested that this aspect of the SAI may reduce the cognitive demands on AI. To further support this, Mattison et al. (2015) conducted studies with the sketch reinstatement of context (Sketch-RC) and mental context reinstatement (MCR) on autistic children and TD children and found that autistic children in the Sketch-RC condition (which consisted of drawing everything they could remember from the earlier video they watched) did significantly better than the autistic children in the MRC condition. In this study by Mattison et al. the results only supported free recall so a further study (Mattison et al., 2018) assessed the same conditions also in a probed setting (cued recall) but found that autistic children still did not have higher accuracy or detail but they did make significantly fewer errors than autistic children in the MRC condition. Therefore, to aid AI and AW in investigative interviews, the results from these studies suggest that it may be worth adding a sketch element to interviews, especially with children, as though it may not make the largest difference in detailed recall, it can reduce the amount of errors made, leading to better information gathered for the police. One recent recommendation that is also based off improving the recall of AW is the Witness-aimed First Account (WAFA). The WAFA (Maras et al., 2020) is another method of alternate interviewing where AW self-direct their recall. They stated that while Sketch-RC and the CI use unbounded narrative recall, the WAFA uses segmentation.. During the WAFA study, both autistic and TD participants watched an intact narrative version and narratively scrambled version of a crime video in a WAFA and control interview condition. WAFA condition participants were asked to segment aspects of their recall through questions such as, what the most important part of the video was, or what else had happened. The interviewer then returned to the noted segments and asked the participant to recall what had happened for each segment mentioned, in the same order they mentioned them in. Maras et al. found that autistic participants recalled around 15% more correct information as well as TD participants compared to the control condition. However, autistic participants still recalled less than TD participants with the WAFA which leads to more uncertainty of why AW still can\u2019t do as well as TD individuals. Also, in the present study, the time between watching the two videos and conducting the interview was 30 minutes which is unrealistic in a real-life setting. A longer wait may reduce the \u2018effects\u2019 of the WAFA, as memory worsens over time or it could also surprisingly prove beneficial. Nevertheless, there is supporting evidence for the segmentation method that the WAFA uses. Zacks and Swallow (2007) talked about segmentation and suggest that the way in which individuals segment events can aid to remembering more and learning better, especially if their events have boundaries. Interestingly, a study into AI and perceiving actions by Zalla et al. (2013) found that among individuals that had to detect boundary transitions in events at \u2018fine and coarse\u2019 levels, autistic participants showed reduced accuracy compared to TD participants. These findings support the notion that AI struggle with detecting event boundaries in a traditional sense, which makes it more difficult to provide detail and accuracy in standard or CI. The WAFA appears as a good recommendation as though it requires further research (one of the first studies), it uses framework like Zacks et al. to try and use segmentation for aiding better recall in AI. A further component mentioned earlier, is the social aspect of interviews with AW. Again, it is explicit knowledge that AI have many social communicative deficits (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and one qualitative study conducted by Benford and Standen (2009) looked into how high-functioning AI and individuals with Asperger\u2019s preferred internet communication (IC). Participants in the study spoke about the idea of control with IC, such as control over time and how much time they spent on thinking. One participant mentioned that IC allowed her to not have to deal with the \u2018incomprehension and frustration\u2019 of a social encounter. The study does specifically involve high-functioning AI which again, may not be applicable to a wider autistic population, however the study acquired a large amount of detailed information as participants sent from 22-82 email postings back and the researchers were able to spend a while developing their conclusions. Although this study doesn\u2019t directly relate to witness interviews, the premises of it and other research into remote interviewing (see Nash et al., 2014) suggest that the use of technology in gathering evidence may add an element of comfortability for interviews, which can strengthen rapport and lead to a better investigation as a whole. This is shown as Collins et al. (2002) found among conditions of \u2018rapport\u2019, \u2018neutral\u2019 and \u2018abrupt\u2019 interviews, participants recalled more correct information in the \u2018rapport\u2019 condition without an increase of incorrect information but were also more willing to co-operate and \u2018try harder\u2019 for the interview. One very important factor in these recommendations is that individually, they may not seem to produce extremely yielding results but with more research, it can become clearer which aspects provide better information (such as the sketch aspect in the SAI) or even whether some techniques will work cohesively or not. To conclude, the first two recommendations aim to improve the recall provided by AW and both draw on the Task Hypothesis (Bowler et al., 2004) which suggests that AI have better recall when they are provided with more support on what they want to remember.

{"id": "aug_16", "anchor": "In this essay, I will mention the key features of the psychodynamic approach, such as Freud and the unconscious mental processes, and those of the biological approach \u2013 genetics, heredity and evolution. Core assumptions, such as the role of nature and nurture in the key features, will also be remarked upon and compared. This essay will allude to how these perspectives are different, their stands on the nature-nurture debate, and how they are similar \u2013 such as the influence of childhood. The key features of the psychodynamic approach are mostly synonymous to Sigmund Freud, and his research with unconscious mental processes. This approach focuses on the influence of the \u2018unconscious\u2019 and how our behaviour as adults is rooted from childhood experiences (Jarvis, 2000). Freud derived theories about the mind and personalities, coming up with theory about the conscious, preconscious and unconscious, how Freudian slips showed what you are truly thinking but trying to hide, and the It (Id), I (Ego), and above-I (superego) (Freud, 1993 as cited in Jarvis, 2000). This means that this approach looks at how past experiences are reflected in current behaviour. Like the psychodynamic approach, the biological approach has a researcher well known to the field \u2013 Charles Darwin. The key features of this approach focus on the role of genetics and evolution. Evolution refers to the way genes in our DNA can change over generations due to the role of \u2018natural selection\u2019. Twin studies have been helpful in researchers understanding to the extent genes play a role in behaviour and how much the environment may play a role in this also. For example, twin and adoption studies show how the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher if you are genetically similar than dissimilar (environment also plays a role as concordance is not 100%) - Cardno &amp; Gottesman (2000). This means that this approach focuses on the interaction of genes and the environment - how nature can influence nurture and nurture can influence nature. A difference between these approaches, is the way that these perspectives view the influence of nature and nurture. The psychodynamic approach concentrates on the role of the unconscious and childhood experiences being the influence on adult behaviour. Therefore, psychoanalysts, such as Freud,, emphasise the role of nurture over nature. In contrast, the biological approach concentrates on the way nature and nurture have a similar influence on each other \u2013 the role of genetics as well as environmental influences. Another similarity with the approaches is that they both have socially sensitive research that have impacted on people negatively. According to Jarvis (2000), in the 1950s and 1960s, psychiatrists following psychodynamic concepts blamed autism on poor parenting. Tavris and Wade (1997) [as cited in Jarvis (2000)] described a case study that illustrated the negatives of taking a purely psychodynamic approach. This approach is reductionist. Its theories are derived from case studies such as Anna O and the work or Tavris and Wade and it tries to explain everything in accordance to psychodynamic theories. Reductionist approaches included socially sensitive research which as a result significantly harmed people \u2013 like the eugenics movement. The work of Galton, fixated on the role of genetics, influencing the eugenics movement. His focus on certain traits being better in society and the fixation that these traits are hereditary only led to the research being abused and hurting thousands of people (Fairholm, 2011). Eugenics was very popular to begin with but eventually it led to a way to discriminate, segregate and sterilise (,and in Nazi Germany, systematically murder) millions of people deemed to have undesirable genes. This dark side of psychology was reductionist and ethically immoral. The eugenics movement attempted to use just genes to explain everything about people. As a result, by focusing only on genes and inheritance, the importance of the environment was ignored (Fairholm, 2011). Neurodevelopmental disorders show that genes are not the only factor to developing a disorder, for example, while Fragile X Syndrome is a purely genetic disorder, Down Syndrome and Williams Syndrome are not hereditary (passed from parents to offspring) even though its genetic, and Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is purely environmental \u2013 no genetic origin. (Witton, C., 2019). This means that separating genes and the environment is not appropriate as neurodevelopmental disorders here show that nature has influence over nurture (Fragile X Syndrome) and nurture has influence over nature (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). The understanding developed from biological theories and discoveries has aided in pharmacological treatment for psychological disorders and the potential understanding on how these disorders develop. The discovery of neurones (by von Waldeyer-Hartz) and eventual discovery of the Synapse (by Sir Charles Sherrington) led to the unearthing of neurotransmitters and their functions \u2013 and their influence on the brain and psychological disorders such as serotonin with depression. This has led to biopsychology to be considered scientific due to objective and controlled research. Similar to this, Freudian theory on ego defences such as displacement, denial and projection are considered today in psychodynamic therapy. These are considered in therapy as psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals, see psychological problems as rooted in childhood and dealing with the root cause, and gaining insight into trauma, can help relieve symptoms. An example of this used in the past would be the case study of Anna O \u2013 bringing trauma into the consciousness by talking about it resolved the symptoms of her hysteria. However, this approach includes vague untestable concepts that lack specifics required to assist in Psychology being considered a science. For example, the Oedipus Complex is almost impossible to measure and the use of case studies, such as Anna O reduces the validity of this approach and it being scientific as participants are not typical of the population. (Jarvis, 2000) Anna O is a case study in the psychodynamic approach which focused on how the mind served to adapt the individual to the environment. The mind presents hysteria to unresolved trauma, the mind adapting the individual to its environment and past experiences. Based on this, I suggest that psychodynamic approach has functionalist perspectives. However, with Freud\u2019s insistence of interpreting and analysing dreams, this approach has certain structuralist qualities. The psychodynamic philosophy analyses the mind based on behaviour that presents itself, such as Freudian slips and dreams, which is partially what structuralism is based upon. Therefore, the psychodynamic approach is an interaction of functionalism and structuralism with a lean towards functionalism. Similarly, the biological approach can be viewed to be an interaction of structuralism and functionalism. The approach analyses the mind and localises areas for specific jobs, such as with genetics and chromosome x or y on the last pair which determines gender or Broca\u2019s area for speech aphasia. This is structuralist. Where this approach links with functionalism is through evolution. Where the mind has adapted an individual to their environment. This is evident with evolutionary fears \u2013 such as fear of heights, the dark and snakes. This behaviour increased survival in the past. Another example of this is the cuteness of babies. This is also a survival factor as infants are unable to look after themselves. As a result, this \u2018cuteness\u2019 factor elicits a caregiving response and the need to look after infants and protect them from the dangers. (Kringelbach, Stark, Alexander, Bornstein &amp; Stein, 2016). A similarity between the biological and psychodynamic approach are that both are deterministic approaches rather than demonstrating free will in their theories. While the biological approach approaches the nature and nurture debate as it being an interaction between the two, it is largely a deterministic approach rather than free will. Biological determinism is where biological concepts or processes determine our thoughts and behaviours (Fairholm, 2011). This approach rejects a total genetic viewpoint, especially because of the eugenics movements, but elements of this approach is still deterministic. An example would be the argument for the MAOA gene and aggression. Some have argued in the past that because one may have this gene and commit and act of aggression, this excuses their behaviour. However, this cannot be accepted in the current Criminal Justice system and that people must take responsibility for their actions as other people with this gene can control their aggression (Holmgren &amp; Winterdyk, 2011). This example shows that the biological approach focuses on deterministic theories rather than free will. Moreover, the psychodynamic approach leans more on determinism than free will. This is evident in the fact that Freudian concepts argue that behaviour in the current is influenced by past experiences in childhood. This leaves little room for free will as a result. Another example is through the ego defences suggested by Freud. These are considered an automatic phenomenon to protect a person from their trauma, for example repression of trauma or displacing anger from the object of their anger to someone more vulnerable \u2013 the person isn\u2019t aware they are doing this consciously. Therefore, this removes the aspect of free will. At first glance, one would assume that the biological approach and the psychodynamic approach are different, that because one focuses on genetics and evolution and the other focuses on early childhood experiences and the unconscious, that there are no similarities. However, this essay shows that, aside from the basic key features, the perspectives are more similar than first assumed. They have people that are well known to their areas \u2013 Freud and Darwin. Furthermore, both indicate that childhood has influence over behaviour \u2013 the unconscious desire and fears presented in Freudian theory and environmental influences on typical body development (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). There are differences in the perspectives, such as the psychanalytical approach considering nurture to have more influence but the biological approach considering the interaction of nature and nurture having equal amount of effect on behaviour. In conclusion, the biological and psychodynamic are much more similar than what would first be assumed.", "positive": "Dear CEO, Attached should be a proposed itinerary planned for yourself with options to choose from according to your preferences.

{"id": "aug_19", "anchor": "This essay will focus on how well FIFA have responded to the 2015 corruption scandal and an in-depth look into the measures they have since taken to prevent bribery being used within FIFA. By looking at different views and academic disciplines to critically evaluate if FIFA have done enough to prevent corruption and bribery continuing within their organisation. Background: FIFA, an organisation people all over the world are familiar with. In 2002 213 countries broadcast the FIFA world cup making it the most watched event in television history. The reach and influence FIFA has is vast. FIFA is a non-profit organisation which describes itself as the international governing body of association football. FIFA was established in 1904 by 7 different nations. The global network and sensation surrounding FIFA Led them to generating $4.6 billion in 2018. In 2015 an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) lead to 14 people being indicted surrounding widespread allegations of corruption, wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering within FIFA. There were allegations that $115 million in bribes were handed over to FIFA officials for several reasons. This case caused several arrests to be made in different countries across the world such as Australia, Columbia, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Germany. This case has been ongoing for several years and allegations of corruption within FIFA have been circulating for many more. In 2002 a FIFA whistle-blower contacted a British journalist with allegations of corruption within FIFA. Later there was a book written by the same journalist (Andrew Jennings) documentary about the corruption and the World Cup this led to the FBI contacting Jennings. Since then more and more information from investigators and whistle-blowers has come to light about bribes and corruption going on within FIFA mainly regarding World Cup\u2019s and where they will be held. Countries were bribing FIFA officials to accept their bid for the World Cup to be held in their country. The investigation has found out that there was bribery involved in Qatar\u2019s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup. In December 2014 FIFA had conducted their own investigation into the allegations of corruption however they did not release the findings of this investigation but just an executive summary. In which they claimed to have exonerated the bidding process of corruption. This decision shows that in 2014 they were not willing to make any major changes or take responsibility for the corruption and bribery that took place. These actions could show FIFAs unwillingness to change these practices and shows in the future it will still be standard practice for FIFA to take bribes. 2022 World Cup: There are many arguments surrounding the FIFA scandal some people argue that Qatar should not be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup as it effectively rewards their actions and involvement in the corruption. There are arguments that it would be inappropriate to allow a controversial state to host the World Cup and have such a large platform. The fact that this corruption harms so many people it breaches the ethics of virtues. There are already red flags being raised about the 2022 World Cup and the fact that for the first time in its history it will be held in the winter due to the temperatures in the summer in the middle east. Anti-corruption expert Sylvia Schenk believes that if there was a legal dispute regarding this it would not be resolved until at least 2028 at which point it is ineffective. Between the scandal in 2015 and the World Cup that is due to take place in 2022 there have been many years and many different chances for FIFA officials to set a precedent and show that they are committed to stamping the corruption out of FIFA. One way to achieve this would be to allow another country to host the 2022 World Cup. It has been argued that this would not be too difficult as many countries have the infrastructure e.g., stadiums set up to accommodate the World Cup therefore logistics should not be an issue here. This shows that FIFA do not appear to have taken anything away from the scandal and try and change for the better. Human Rights: The issues regarding the 2015 scandal are still Widely debated 2021. With Qualifying stages of the 2022 World Cup starting players have been protesting the allegations of human rights of migrant workers being breached in Qatar due to host the 2022 World Cup. The Guardian revealed in February 2021 that since Qatar won the bid to host the tournament in 2010 over 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar. However, this shocking statistic could be misleading it is impossible to know how many of these deaths are related to human rights breaches and how many are related to the World Cup. This however does not look good for FIFA or Qatar surrounding this global event especially as 37 deaths have been directly linked to the construction of the stadiums. This issue that is gaining global traction due partly to Norway who on the 24th of March protested by wearing T-shirts during the warmup which read \"human rights on and off the pitch \"in their World Cup qualifying match. Other teams have started to follow suit by wearing T-shirts raising awareness of the problem. Kimmich has argued that teams are 10 years too late to boycott. The damage has already been done and Qatar have been allowed to get away with this for far too long protests should have been taking place when Qatar was allocated the World Cup and before they started building all the stadiums. However, The German football Federation is not in favour of boycotting the World Cup. So, all the T-shirt wearing in the world will not help the migrant workers that have died or will continue to die for this World Cup or others to come. This is yet another example of a time where FIFA have sat back and let corruption run rife within its organisation six years after the corruption scandal this therefore shows they have not made major improvements or changes to stop his from happening for many more years to come. Social Responsibility: It is not just a legal field that believes FIFA are problematic. It is argued that FIFA are also corrupt in terms of their corporate social responsibility. In a 2014 study it was found that corporations and companies that sponsored FIFA were disliked more and trusted less by the public and people are more likely to negatively talk about these brands with their peers. This study can be very negative for FIFA and the many brands that pay them millions in sponsorship. This could cause massive problems for FIFA in the future if corporations and brands the sponsor that events decide that they do not want to be associated any more. This is one example of how the corruption scandal has negatively impacted FIFA is brand and therefore value. Therefore, correcting and changing this public perception will be crucial to FIFAs continued success. Feminist Perspective: There is also a view that FIFA is a \"boys club\". Professional tennis player Billie Jean King has tried to advocate for FIFA to hire more female managers and to appoint more females into higher roles within the company and hire someone specifically for the purpose of regulating gender equality within the company. She also raises a point that having more women within FIFA could improve the culture of corruption that exists. There have been studies that show that women are less likely to be involved in bribery and are less likely to condone bribe taking. Data from different countries shows that corruption is less severe where women held more seats in parliament or more senior positions and comprise of a larger share of the labour force. Therefore, viewing this issue from the feminist perspective one way FIFA could counter some corruption could be to employ women in more positions and in more senior roles. However, it could be argued that this is less of a gender difference and more of a culturally based issue in however due to the global nature of FIFA this could potentially make a difference. The fact that some of these issues were raised years ago and have not been acted upon shows once again that FIFA are not dedicated to eradicating corruption. Legalities: FIFA is registered and incorporated under swiss law. It is a very attractive base for many international organisations not only due to its location and political stability Switzerland also has most importantly a very lenient legal code and attractive tax regime. This could be one of the reasons that attracted FIFA to incorporate itself there. Switzerland is perceived to be a country that is least affected by corruption however this does not prevent organisations that are located there being involved in corruption. Article 332 of the Swiss criminal code only refers to the bribery of a public official as criminal therefore there is no criminal liability for the bribery of officials in international sports organisations such as FIFA. It could be argued that this is one of the reasons that corruption and bribery has run rampant within FIFA for so many years. It could be argued that under the Swiss federal act on unfair competition the type of bribery happening within FIFA could be criminally prosecuted. However transparency International believe that it is unclear whether this would be applicable to sport and FIFA. In 2004 the Federal Council ruled that this article did not apply to non-governmental organisations e.g. FIFA. There have been moves made by the Swiss Parliament to change the law so that Bribery that does not involve public officials can be criminally charged. This was following a recommendation from GRECO. This accountability should prevent more bribes taking place within FIFA. Geography: The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates a situation where it is impossible for one country to be able to keep track and punish such a large organisation. FIFA is a billion-pound empire that effectively has the ability to punish countries this makes them untouchable. This system negatively affects smaller and poorer countries. Morocco was also competing for the 2022 World Cup and after spending millions on the campaign they lost out to Qatar due to the bribes Qatar paid to FIFA officials. Currently 32 teams and subsequently 32 countries play in the World Cup, FIFA have been discussing pushing this to 48 countries. Bringing more countries in to the World Cup could potentially reduce corruption and bribery as that is more accountability and even more countries will be watching them. However, this could go the other way and now there are 16 more countries that could be involved in bribery. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup they denied Morocco the chance to host the World Cup. It could be argued that Morocco deserve the World Cup more as they are a smaller economy and the World Cup would have benefited them more than Qatar. It could also be argued that after the bribery Qatar used to gain the world cup came to light Morocco should have been awarded the World Cup. There has been talks of Spain Portugal and Morocco teaming up for a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup however Spain and Portugal signed a joint bid agreement and left Morocco out once again this could be devastating for Morocco\u2019s economy. There have been studies into GDP and corruption. Qatar\u2019s GDP is 175.8 billion c compared to Morocco\u2019s 119.7 both in 2019. The study indicates that the poorer country the more likely they are to be susceptible to corruption however in this example that does not seem to be the case as based on GDP Qatar has more wealth but clearly, they were more susceptible to bribery. Psychology: There are many Psychological theories and there has been lots of research completed in regards to bribery and corruption. One of the main theories that comes from psychological studies is the trust game. This was first created by Berg et al the results from the study were surprising and went against the standard economic theory upon which they were based. The theory and results of this study can be applied to FIFA the anonymity and scale of the bribery makes it easier for people to be corrupted as there is a level of anonymity. One problem with this theory is that the study was done in 1995 on a very small population therefore the results cannot be generalised to modern society and the global society where customs cultures and values vary massively. Studies like this one tend to be studied by white men and study white men therefore there is massive gender and racial bias involved in the results of this study which reduce the effectiveness of it outside of the context of a single study. Similar studies were conducted that compared data from many different countries to see if there was a relationship between nationality and the likelihood to take or condone bribery. The study found that collectivism versus individualism on a national scale was the fact and most likely to affect bribery. This theory seems to line up with Qatar as it has a very large wealth divide. This divide makes it much easier for people to take part in bribes. In 1995 there was a cross national study focusing on ethics this study found that there was substantial crossover between personality values but the moral reasoning very significantly. The psychologists use social cognitive theory to explain the practical implications of this study. This could explain why some countries are more likely to be involved in bribery than others due to social cognitive theory and shared values of a society. There are many different areas of psychology that relate directly to bribery and corruption and the FIFA scandal. These theories should be able to show a way for bribery to be reduced in the future. This can be seen using the evolutionary psychology principle. This theory states that there are distinct patterns of corruption that can be seen throughout history with the FIFA 2015 corruption scandal named as one. This theory explains that social and cultural norms have evolved over time to allow to happen more freely. This could be good news for FIFA as it could explain why so much bribery has happened within the organisation and it could help reduce their blame and liability for the bribery. This theory can also show how to reduce bribery within FIFA in the future. Legal Case: The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates and in capability of anyone to be able to keep try and punish such a large organisation. FIFA is billion-pound empire that effectively has the ability to punish countries this makes them untouchable. This system negatively affects smaller and poorer countries. Morocco was also competing for the 2022 World Cup and after spending millions on the campaign they lost out to Qatar due to the bribes Qatar paid to FIFA officials. Currently 32 teams and subsequently 32 countries play in the World Cup, FIFA have been discussing pushing this to 48 countries. Bringing more countries in to the World Cup could potentially reduce corruption and bribery as that is more accountability and even more countries will be watching them. However, this could go the other way and now there are 16 more countries that could be involved in bribery. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup they Denied Moscow the chance to host the World Cup. It could be argued that Morocco deserve the World Cup more as they are a smaller economy and the World Cup would have benefited them more than guitar. It could also be argued that after the truck in time like Morocco should have been awarded the World Cup. There has been talks of Spain Portugal and Morocco teaming up for a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup however Spain and Portugal signed a joint bid agreement and left Morocco out once again this could be devastating for Morocco\u2019s economy. There have been studies into GDP and corruption. Catarrhs GDP is 175.8 billion c compared to Morocco\u2019s 119.7 both in 2019. The study indicates that the poorer country the more likely they are to be susceptible to corruption however in this example that does not seem to be the case as base of GDP Qatar has more wealth but clearly, they were more susceptible to bribery. To conclude it appears that FIFA have not done everything in their power to prevent further corruption happening since the 2015 scandal. However, it is a very large and complex issue that covers many legal and political jurisdictions. This therefore makes it very hard to give definitive answer to how well FIFA dealt with the scandal. From my research for this essay, I have come across many recommendations for how FIFA could reduce bribery and corruption from so many different academic disciplines and the fact that FIFA has not implemented any of the shows FIFA has not learnt from 2015. On balance it appears they have not made enough changes to prevent this from happening again.", "positive": "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Is it Auntie \u2019s birthday? Xx Hi mum!

{"id": "aug_31", "anchor": ", Honestly, it's scary at first but just so amazing especially because (as silly as this sounds) I don't think we are exposed enough to different cultures here. Yes! To be honest, I never considered it either until contacted me asking me to consider as my grammar was quite bad in second year. Maybe you could look into a study placement for the language you feel weaker with? Answering your questions: I just found that I was benefitting a lot from the course I was doing and was noticing that my was genuinely improving. I was also just thinking about what was more beneficial for me in the future (as in for final year) and genuinely I was just really enjoying being in a very multicultural environment so didn't want to leave. Also my second placement that I was supposed to be on was an English speaking placement in so again didn't feel like I wouldn't benefit as much from it. So I did have a second placement lined up for my second semester as a for a company called in (also, don't listen to everything the placement team tells you because they just want you to get any placement not necessarily a good one). When I was on my study placement, I decided quite early on that I didn't want to do the work placement (it was also because I wouldnt have been able to afford to live in so make sure you look at that when looking for placements because the placements team don't think about finance) so I just emailed them and told them for personal reasons I couldn't continue and they were fine about it. I'm going to be honest with you....I didn't apply until for placements because I was too scared to and also had some mental health issues in second year but don't leave it this late!! I would say start looking in (that's when all the big ones like etc open) and don't just apply for anything, make sure you apply for what YOU want to do or are interested in as the placements team don't really take this into consideration. I made both but for a study placement application you don't need one you just have to write a short essay about why you would be a good candidate for that University and then for the other one I only had to send my English CV but i would recommend doing both as it's good practice for the future and there are modules in second year to help you do this so make sure you use the language assistants as much as possible.

{"id": "aug_38", "anchor": "Both the biological and psychoanalytic approaches seek to explain human behaviour. The biological approach proposes the idea that all psychological problems are rooted in physiological causes, whereas the psychoanalytic approach suggests that behaviour is due to unconscious forces and childhood experiences. The key features of these approaches are distinct from each other and have their uses and limitations, yet, both are still widely used in psychology. The biological approach prevails over other psychological approaches due to the fact that its explanations encompass anatomy, physiology and the role of neurological function. This approach accepts the idea of materialism as it assumes that all behaviour has a physical basis. This opposes the previously accepted idea of dualism, in which it was believed that the body and the mind are separate but interacting entities. The shift from dualism to materialism was supported with work by Paul Broca (1861). In studying a patient called \u2018Tan\u2019, Broca discovered that there was a direct link between the articulation of speech and damage to a particular cortical region. This area was later named \u2018Broca\u2019s area\u2019 and pioneered the idea that particular cognitive functions can be localised to areas in the cerebral cortex (Grodzinsky &amp; Amunts, 2006). Localisation of brain function is a central concept to the biological approach. Broca (1861) and Wernicke\u2019s (1874) findings were some of the first to show that damage to cortical areas produces a change in language. A significant drawback of these findings was that they were concluded from limited post-mortem evidence, which makes it difficult to show the specificity of location. The mechanism of speech may be something that is controlled by multiple areas, so damage to any one of these areas may produce the same effect (Myers, 2007). Recent research by Delgado and Hamlin (1956) demonstrated how stimulation of the motor cortex using electrodes led to specific physical reactions. In one individual the left motor cortex was stimulated, and it was found that the right fist would clench. This provided support for the latter idea that the cerebral cortex is split into four lobes, each relating to a different function (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). Another feature of the biological perspective is the idea of brain communication through the use of neurotransmitters. These chemicals are involved in regulating processes in the body such as emotion. If there is a biochemical imbalance in these systems, this may in turn affect human behaviour. A review by Seo and Patrick (2008) demonstrated how a deficiency in serotonin combined with high levels of dopamine interact together in the prefrontal cortex and may predispose individuals to aggressive behaviour. This follows the diathesis-stress model in stating how irregularities in biological systems may predispose individuals to certain conditions which manifest after being triggered. This shows that contrary to general assumption, the biological approach does not entirely ignore the role of nature in human behaviour. It acknowledges that biology may be just the precursor to abnormal behaviour. Empiricism is an essential component in understanding the functioning behind biological systems. Experiments such as Delgado and Hamlin, (1956) and Seo and Patrick, (2008) show that being deeply embedded in the observational methods of science provides an advantage of the biological approach over others. This level of empiricism means that studies can be easily replicated. Likewise, the possibility of direct manipulation of a variable and the observation of the response means that valid conclusions can be drawn. From this, researchers are then able to take away evidence that helps support concepts such as neurotransmitter effects. As the biological approach follows the law of parsimony, it often finds itself being criticised for being too reductionist. Complex behaviour is simplified down to individual physiological mechanisms. For example, the concept of being able to produce language is reduced to the interactions between neurones in the frontal lobe when the explanation behind this may be far more intricate. This approach is also deterministic as biological processes are exempt from our free will. If aggression is due to neurotransmitter abnormality, this suggests that there is no control over the behaviour exhibited. However, evidence by Van Lier, Vitaro and Eisner (2007) has shown how peer rejection in children can lead to maladaptive behaviours, including aggression. This demonstrates how an environmental rather than a biological factor can lead to an individual choosing to express their aggressive behaviour. An alternative to this is the psychoanalytic approach which was developed by Sigmund Freud in 1896. One of the concepts Freud introduced was that personality development is moulded by childhood experiences and fixations, namely the psychosexual stages of development. He theorised that all children go through the oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stages in which the individual is focused on obtaining pleasure through the specific areas. In each of these stages, there is the possibility for fixation to occur. If this occurs at any stage, personality development into adulthood may be affected (Fennald, 1997). A second concept is that personality is split into the id, ego and superego which are unconscious forces that influence our decisions and motives. The id contains sexual instincts (libido) and aggressive instincts (Eysenck, 1988). The superego reflects the moral standards of society, restricting the id from making decisions which would not be allowed and the ego is the decision maker, mediating between the two (Jarvis, 2000). There is substantial contemporary evidence to suggest that Freud was correct in some of his propositions, like his idea of unconscious cognitive processes. Research by Westen (1999) looks to explain how the activation of particular unconscious associative networks influences ongoing thoughts, feelings and behaviour outside our awareness. Westen theorised that when networks associated with a particular situation are activated, this spreads to other neural networks and increases the likelihood of interpreting a situation in a certain way. This supports Freud\u2019s idea by showing how a previous experience, stored in the unconscious, is able to influence future interactions. The psychoanalytic approach has advantages over the biological approach by taking a multifaceted view and acknowledging both sides of the nature-nurture debate. The role of nature is considered in how innate drives influence our thoughts, and the role of nurture in how childhood experiences elicit behaviour. Consequently, this approach has similarities with the biological in assuming determinism. Behaviour in adult life is affected by the fixation of libido which suggests that we are shaped by irrepressible forces that are exempt from free will. The scientific status of the psychoanalytic approach is called into question on multiple occasions which puts it at a disadvantage to the biological approach. Variables are not manipulated, which makes it difficult to produce causal conclusions, and therefore leads to issues with the falsifiability. Freud\u2019s theories were based upon untested observations in a purely therapeutic situation. Qualitative research derived from case studies are a less reliable source of information and Freud only used 12 over the lifespan of his published work (Eysenck, 2000). However, more contemporary research by Fonagy and Bateman (1999) has shown how the psychoanalytic approach has evolved over time to incorporate more controlled data-gathering methods. In order to test the effectiveness of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalisation as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), Fonagy and Bateman (1999) conducted a randomised control trial and assessed outcome measures such as number of admissions, frequency of suicide attempts and symptom distress. There was a well-structured methodological approach to this study, including the use of DSM-III-R criteria to assess for BPD before participants were randomly assigned to the two groups. This study is an example of how the psychoanalytic approach should not be completely disregarded as non-scientific as current research looks to improve the legitimacy of methods that are used. In conclusion, the biological and the psychoanalytic approach parallel each other in terms of their determinism and their perspective on nature. However, the biological approach has an advantage over the psychoanalytic approach as it is empirical and has a strong scientific basis which supports its credibility. The early concepts of the psychoanalytic approach are difficult to falsify but on the other hand, contemporary psychoanalytic research has since developed to include more rigorous scientific procedures. Despite issues with both approaches, key features have their place in psychology today with localisation of brain function, the action of neurotransmitters and unconscious cognitive processes still being widely accepted.", "positive": "r Professor, I am following you now, that makes sense thankyou.

{"id": "aug_40", "anchor": "Creativity refers to solutions that are either unusual or insightful and of real value and a creative solution must be recognised by society and must be useful or valuable to people. When studying creativity, there are four perspectives which are usually focused on, they include: creative environments, creative people, the products of creativity and the creative process. The two major approaches that are used to study creativity are the biographic and autobiographic approach in addition to the psychometric approach. The biographic and autobiographic approach suggests that there are multiple common factors which are needed for creative achievements. Wallas (1926) stated that the creative process has four stages, which are: the preparation stage, the incubation stage, the inspiration stage and lastly the verification stage. These stages have been reproduced, to some extent, in experiments although the incubation stage is considered controversial. In the psychometric perspective, tests are administered to creative people to uncover what creative people are like. Guilford (1956) differentiated between divergent and convergent thinking. Guildford found divergent thinking is thinking of multiple solutions to a problem whilst convergent thinking is converging on the best answer to a problem. By differentiating the two, Guilford conceptualised creativity as a form of divergent thinking leading to psychometric tests being used to asses creativity. However, these tests mix creativity and originality in addition to creativity and intelligence which can be a problem as it will be hard to assess the results of only creativity.", "positive": "o, is there any advice you could give for the assignment question?

{"id": "aug_49", "anchor": "Abstract: This experiment investigates the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) using a cued visual attention task through an electroencephalogram (EEG). The predictions for this study are that alpha activity would be higher for the left parietal lobe in the cue left (Cl) condition rather than cue right (Cr). 39 psychology students performed visual attention task and were cued to expect the stimulus on either the right or left. This study found that the left condition did have higher alpha amplitudes in comparison to the right condition when recording for P3. The findings for this study supported previous research and found that in conclusion the alpha inhibition is indicative of attention. Introduction: \u2018High alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas\u2019 (Kilesch 2007) and is also reduced in task relevant brain areas. The findings of Handel et al (2011) showed that the stimuli presented to the participants visually were processed on the opposite side of the brain to where the stimuli were, and it is contralateral to the unattended side showing significantly higher alpha power. The results show that if a stimulus was to be presented on the left-hand side, it will be processed on the right side of the brain. A study by Sauseng et al (2005) which is being partially replicated by this study, asked participants to conduct a cued visual attention task and focused on different regions of the brain. The participants responded to a stimulus on a screen after being presented with an arrow that was an indication of which side the stimulus would appear on. The results show the side of the brain in which the stimuli had been processed, will obtain less alpha. There was also a significant effect of cue 200ms prior to stimulus onset recording from P3. These studies all show that alpha activity will be higher on the ipsilateral side in which the stimuli is shown, this supports the AIH. Therefore, supporting studies suggest that the hypothesis for this study is that the alpha amplitude would be higher in the Cl than the Cr, when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe. Method: Participants: A total of 39 undergraduate psychology students volunteered to be a participant, they were split into 5 groups. Design: The study was a repeated measures design as each participant saw both Cl and Cr conditions. The independent variable is the direction of the cue consisting of 2 levels whether it was left or right, and the dependant variable is the alpha amplitudes measured in microvolts (\u03bcV). Materials: Data was collected using a Biopac MP360. EEG electrodes were used, and AC cream was applied to help with the conductivity and reduce impedance. Everi cream to reduce skin impedance. PsychoPy is used to provide the stimuli and an event marker is sent to the Biopac. A large and small bar stimulus (figure 1a and 1b) in which participants focus their attention to. And arrow cues letting the participants know which side the stimulus will appear on, symbolised by the keys &lt; and &gt;. Procedure: The Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35 Hz and channels are set up to allow the left and right cue event markers to be accessed through PsychoPy, the event markers were used to identify when the stimuli were presented. Another channel is set up to record activity from the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz), the sampling rate was 1000 Hz; 1000 observations recorded per second. The experimenter explained the objective to the participant and consent was given before proceeding, electrodes were then put into place. Following the \u20181020 system positioning\u2019 the active electrode is placed on the P3 site on the left side of the parietal lobe in the brain. The reference electrode is placed at Fz and the earth electrode is placed by the participants hairline. Impedance checks are then done and were kept below 10KOhms. Instructions were presented on the screen for the participants to follow, stating that a cue will appear indicating which side the stimulus will appear on; left or right. A fixation cross appeared in the centre then followed by a stimulus of a bar either large or small. Participants were then told to press a specific key depending on which bar was presented e.g., \"L\" for large bar and \"S\" for small bar. Practice trials were completed first to allow them to test run the experiment and understand what they are being asked to do. Participants took part in 4 different conditions with 3 repeats so a total of 12 practice trials. Once completed feedback was given to the participants. Similarly, to the practice trial, participants then took part in the real trial containing 20 blocks of 4 trials in which 50% of the trials cued left and 50% cued right all in a randomised order. In total there was 80 experimental trials. The cues were presented on the screen for 35ms. Then followed by a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) this is set for 200ms to 1200ms. An event marker is then sent at the onset of the stimulus and the stimulus was then displayed for 50ms. Participants then proceed to respond. During the study the experimenters explained to the participant what the task was, they put the electrodes in place and proceeds to the impedance test, then the experimenter begins the experiment for the participant to complete. The experimenter recorded the data which was then followed by debriefing the participant about the aims of the study. The experimenter helped to clean up the participant then proceeded to analyse the data that was recorded. Participants had to read the instructions that appeared before starting the experiment and follow these instructions by pressing certain keys and focusing on what appears on the screen. Data treatment: When the experiment is running, event markers were sent to the computer, then to the biopac. This records exactly when the stimuli were presented, this allows the period 200ms before stimulus onset to be analysed for the Cl and Cr condition. The raw alpha data were then rectified regardless of it being either excitatory or inhibitory. This meant that any negative values were converted to positive values and an average deviation from 0\u03bcV was produced. The data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce extreme values. These data then become rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA). Results: Table 1 shows the results for 38 participants as one participant withdrew from the experiment, so no data is provided. A Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to test whether the data was parametric or non-parametric. As the p value was less than .05, a non-parametric test was carried out. The median RAAA indicates that the Cl condition had higher alpha amplitude compared to the CR condition at the P3 site. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T= 566, n= 38, p= .002). Discussion: The findings support the hypothesis that there is greater alpha amplitude when the stimuli are Cl then when the stimuli are Cr. Our results are consistent with the AIH and Sauseng et al as alpha activity is contralateral to the side it is processed, and our results showed there was less alpha activity contralateral to the stimuli where the visual stimuli had been processed. This suggest that the side of the brain that is not involved with attention has less alpha activity. A methodological problem of this study is that attention could have been redirected due to being in a distracting environment in which multiple other students were talking. Evidence from previous research (Garrison &amp; Williams 2013) shows that participants do not perform as well when distracted and are more likely to make common mistakes when taking part in a task. To gain more accurate results these limitations will need to be controlled such as being in an environment with minimal noises, therefore helping the participant to focus better.", "positive": "s can move around It\u2019s a small little decoration Very nice Dad you very very silly man You are years old and need rest before you work Silly man can you text when you nearly reach and then ring me when you are outside What time does it say you will get here Are you nearly here At ?

{"id": "aug_51", "anchor": "Assessing Attitudes Towards Zoos Introduction: This study\u2019s hypothesis is that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos would have a wide variation. This is because some participants may have a positive attitude due to their involvement in conserving species, and some a negative attitude due to animal captivity. Reade and Waran (1996) support this, stating that zoo visitors have positive perceptions of zoos whereas members of the general public have negative views. Method: Positive and negative statements about zoos were pooled in which 10 of each were selected for the pilot study (Appendix 1), which recruited 10 participants. Negative statement scores were then reversed, so that negative attitudes equate to low scores, and vice versa. To assess the internal validity of the pilot questionnaire, each participant\u2019s scores were totalled (see Appendix 3), and the 4 highest and lowest scored participants were selected. The 4s and 5s selected by positive and negative participants were compared to assess whether an item was discriminatory. Statements differing in scores between these participants fit into such criteria. 4 discriminatory positive and negative statements were selected for the main study (Appendix 2). The 10 original participants were recruited for this version, along with a further 10. The totals of each original participant were compared between the pilot and main study (Appendix 4) to assess the questionnaire\u2019s reliability. Total scores of all participants were then calculated (Appendix 5). Results: The internal validity test (Appendix 3) showed that 11 statements were discriminatory: 4 negative, and 7 positive. The lowest scores ranged from 41 to 45, while the highest ranged from 55 to 69. These participants reported either the most negative or positive attitudes respectively. Only two participants produced the same score when completing the pilot study and the main study (Appendix 4). A Spearman\u2019s Rho test found that there was a significantly strong correlation between the test and re-test scores (rs = .838, p &lt; .01). 90% of participants scored higher in the pilot study compared to the main study. 3 of the 4 positive statements had standard deviations (SD) over 1 (Appendix 2), meaning that there was a wider variation of responses to these, whilst negative statements had SDs less than 1. The statement with the lowest SD was positive (SD = .489), whilst the highest was negative (SD = 1.268). As the hypothesis suggested, participants had a wide variation of scores (M = 22.4, SD = 4.297), ranging from 16 to 28 (Appendix 5). This SD indicates a large spread of data across the mean. Conclusion: The results of Appendix 3 showed that there was high internal validity since the positive and negative statements differed in scores by participants, suggesting that the questionnaire measures what it was set out to measure. The Spearman\u2019s Rho test showed that the questionnaire had high test-retest reliability as results from participants were similar in the pilot compared to the main study (Appendix 4). The larger SD of the final responses of the positive statements indicate that the results are widely spread across the mean, while the smaller SDs for the negative statements suggest that there was less of a variation in responses to these. Therefore, it can be concluded that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos do not have a wide variation, as participant\u2019s responses were polarised, with a smaller variance in responses with negative statements compared to positive.", "positive": "hh snm I'd say do it But just don't deep it Just see what happens innit That's tru But still Do it Bro FIRM ITTT Might aswell get it out the way What's the worst that can happen Also I cleaned the whole yard for you U better be gassed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Not that it deffo needed cleaning lmfaoooo Need to get the red carpet out Bro ok so I rlly wanna go primark now So we going next week idc I'm dragging u \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and the party time banner Need to stop wearing joggers and the same 2 tshirts SAAAAME IVE NOT EVEN STARTED", "positive_attacked": "hh snm I'd say do it But just don't deep it Just see what happens innit That's tru But still Do it Bro FIRM ITTT Might aswell get it out the way What's the worst that can happen Also I cleaned the whole yard for you U better be gassed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Not that it deffo needed cleaning lmfaoooo Need to get the red carpet out Bro ok so I rlly wanna go primark now So we going next week idc I'm dragging u \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and the party time banner Need to stop wearing joggers and the same 2 tshirts SAAAAME IVE NOT EVEN STARTED", "label": 1}

Why I\u2019m coming to you is because my interest is more so in your expertise, so I was hoping if you recommend some job websites or even people I would be very grateful. So my interest is to work in the migration section or even the development section. I would like to eventually work in the policy section of that department to oversee revisions towards migration policies. This is especially for conditions for immigrants who come from developing countries. Some countries set quotas or are restrictive of the people they let in, and I know being a BAME person that some people leaving developing countries are escaping many issues back home and want a better life in a developed country. I\u2019ve read inspiring stories of children from who were blessed with opportunities to live in industrialised countries, and they are great personalities today. This is not to say is limiting, but the opportunities tend to be limiting so it would be very interesting to see how migration policy can be revised to allow those who want to better their lives (especially childrenyoung adults) to do so. This sounds like a long waffle, but it\u2019s just for you to get a clearer picture. I was searching policy advisor in migration development departments in regards to graduate jobs, and nothing was coming up. I hope you can guide me and steer me in the right way.

{"id": "aug_60", "anchor": "Results Data treatment After the data was recorded, the alpha channel was duplicated which made it easier to keep track of the transformations made to the signal (\"EEG Analysis with AcqKnowledge\", 2006). The data was rectified in order to turn the negative values into positive so that the average signal strength (\u00b5V) was shown rather than the range. The data was averaged over 50 samples using Biopac\u2019s \u2018Integrate\u2019 feature which allowed for the graph curves to be smoother and clearer. The rectification and integration of the data was necessary so that an accurate mean could be taken for each condition. These new rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for the rest of the data analysis. Descriptive &amp; inferential statistics Table 1. Table 1 shows that the mean of the eyes open condition was lower than the eyes closed condition. There was not a large amount of variance of data across the means (see Table 1). The eyes open condition had a smaller variance than the eyes closed, as the standard deviation was closer to the mean in this condition. The Chi\u00b2 test suggests that the frequencies of the RAAA are significantly different in the eyes open and closed conditions (Chi\u00b2 = 12.500, df = 1, p &lt; .01). The RAAA frequency was 26 in the eyes closed condition and 6 in the eyes open condition, so the means are consistent with the RAAA frequencies. To summarise, the results show that there is a difference between the RAAA frequencies of the eyes open and eyes closed conditions. These results were expected as brain rhythms differ when eyes are open or closed (Barry et al., 2007). Reflection I have achieved a general understanding of physiological measurement using Biopac from conducting this study, as I have learnt how to use the system to rectify and integrate data in order for it to be more understandable to analyse. As a group, we found the placement of the electrodes using the international 1020 positioning system fairly difficult, as it wasn\u2019t particularly clear where exactly to place them on the scalp. We had to change the positioning of the electrodes and remove the dead skin from the scalp a few times until the impedance was low enough to continue the rest of the experiment. I didn\u2019t enjoy placing the electrodes on the participant\u2019s scalp and measuring the distance between the nasion and the inion because both tasks were meticulous and required a lot of patience. However, I did enjoy using Biopac to rectify the data in order to see clearly the brainwaves of the participant and how it correlated with whether their eyes were open or closed. In order to improve the experiment, I would reduce the number of confounding variables by ensuring the participant wasn\u2019t blinking, talking or chewing during the experiment, as these artifacts may have had an impact on the data used for analysis. Additionally, I would have ensured the experiment took part in a quiet room away from other people as it is more likely for the brainwave activity to be due to whether the participant\u2019s eyes were open or closed rather than distractions.", "positive": "ave attached a copy of my portfolio just in case.

{"id": "aug_63", "anchor": "In the United Kingdom in 2019 there was 1.6% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Postnote, 2020). The high number of ASD children means that it is imperative to have correct measures in place when they are put through police interviewing. There are policies in place to support children under the age of 18 who classed as \u2018vulnerable witnesses\u2019 (impairment to intelligence and social functioning), by giving them assistance to provide the best evidence possible in court (Ministry of Justice, 2011). However, in our justice system there are still issues which need to be corrected, as current research shows that when a child is labelled with \u2018autism\u2019 the evidence they provide is questioned in credibility by jurors (Crane et al., 2018). On top of this, the difficulties present in ASD children could significantly impact the information that is gathered by police, as they lack communication, social skills (Knott et al., 2006) and also impairments in memory (Bruck et al., 2007). There are two recommendations which will be examined to help police gather evidence in ASD children. The standard cognitive interview includes four main techniques (K\u00f6hnken et al., 1999). Mental context reinstatement (MRC) is one segment of the interview that requires the person to go back in time to remember the emotions they felt and the physical environment around them (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2011). However, ASD children have impairments in their memory, specifically in their autonoetic consciousness (Gardiner, 2001), this therefore, means that they might find the process of MRC difficult. Evidence has shown this to be true as people with autism recalled fewer details in the MRC interview (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). This is especially relevant to ASD children, as they already tend to recall fewer details than typically developing (TD) children (Williams et al., 2006). Therefore, police need to find an appropriate way of aiding recall for ASD children as the MRC has shown to exacerbate their memory. The inclusion of sketching as a form of context reinstatement (Sketch-RC) rather than the normal MRC before a free recall has been seen to be beneficial for ASD children in recall (Mattison et al., 2014). A study that delved further into this had used ASD children and TD children to watch a video (Mattison et al., 2018), and then had compared sketch-RC and MRC, following with a free recall afterward. A probed recall phase was also used to gain further detail, but it was entirely based on what the children had stated in their free recall. In this case, the findings supported the usage of sketch-RC in interviewing as ASD children recalled 25% more than the ASD children in the MRC condition. This could be explained by the encoding specificity theory (Tulving, 1972); which states that the ASD children recalled better because the cues were present in encoding and retrieving, so, the sketches helped facilitate these cues more than just mentally reinstating the context. In contrast, Henry et al (2017) had conducted a similar study but additionally looked into \u2018verbal labels\u2019 and \u2018registered intermediary\u2019 interviews, there was no improvement in recall to the ASD children in the Sketch-RC or the other two interviews. This comes to question whether Sketch-RC does improve memory recall or were there methodological issues that caused the study to not find any significant results. This study did have its limitations, as Dando et al (2018) had brought this to light. Participants were aimlessly placed in either a live condition or a video condition, 83% of TD children and only 30% of ASD children were placed in the live condition. This could have impacted the significance of the results because ASD children are more perceptive of their surroundings, as they process sensory information around them differently (O\u2019Neill and Jones, 1997), therefore the children could have encoded the information differently when streaming a video version rather than witnessing the live event, impacting the validity of the results. Even though there might be drawbacks to the article\u2019s methodology to cause the results to not support sketch-RC, there are still several studies that reinforce the idea of how positive the sketch-RC can be in real life. For instance, a field study had looked into children\u2019s accounts of sexual abuse. The use of drawing had significantly increased the amount of detail recalled, rather than just a standard interview (Katz &amp; Hershkowitz, 2009). With this in mind, sketch-RC has shown to be valuable in the real world as well as in just studies, so police should highly consider using this method to capture more information. The takeaway message is that the MRC in a cognitive interview might not be an appropriate measure to gather information from ASD children. So, the use of sketch-RC might be considered more appropriate than MRC when conducting a cognitive interview for ASD children, as it allows them to access memories using the contextual cues from their sketches. This will be fairly important in real life as each information given by the witness can help in finding the perpetrator or piecing the investigation together. Consequently, social interaction is vital in police interviewing, as it requires a verbal exchange of information. However, ASD children tend to lack the social skills to interact and confidently communicate to get their ideas across (Knott et al., 2006). The cognitive interview, therefore, might pose a problem, as ASD children will consider it socially demanding (Johnson, et al., 2018), which might cause them to become distressed and impact their retrieval of information (Quas &amp; Lench, 2007). On account of this, the advancements in technology can allow police interviews to be conducted with robots rather than humans to minimise the distress (Wood et al., 2013). There have been significant benefits in the use of robots, as they have shown to improve the social skills of TD children (Robins et al., 2004; Aresti-Bartolome and Garcia-Zapirain 2014) and in ASD children (Wainer et al., 2010). The creation of \u2018Kinesics and Synchronization in Personal Assistant Robotics\u2019 (KASPAR) has shown to be beneficial to ASD children. An observational study had been conducted to see how children would react to the KASPAR with adults present (Robins et al., 2009). They had found that the ASD children interacted positively by smiling, touching, and gazing at the KASPAR. Also, an important finding they had found was that it helped facilitate social interactions with the co-present adult. This could be beneficial in police interviewing as it will help support the ASD child in feeling comfortable, but also can act as a social mediator for when ASD children are being interviewed. Nevertheless, evidence has shown that the KASPAR does come with its challenges, as a study had found that children were scared of viewing the robot because of how it looked (Huijnen et al., 2018). This would undermine the use of KASPAR, as it would cause further distress and impacting the ASD child\u2019s memory. Opposed to this view, a reinforcing study by Wood et al (2013) had comparable results to Robins et al (2009) using the KASPAR. However, the study involved the children to be interviewed in a similar manner to a police interview, as they had used questions that would retrieve facts and not feelings from the children. The eye gaze and interview duration were much longer when the interviewer was a KASPAR rather than a human. This key finding links with ASD children as eye contact is a necessary part of communication (Nation and Penny., 2008). This adds support to the use of KASPAR in police interviews as it will help ASD children to feel at ease and help in memory recall; but also this study helps put in perspective how the use of a robot could help ASD children in a police setting. ASD children\u2019s perception of the KASPAR allows us to understand why they feel more closer to robots than humans. They seem to identify them as toys (Peca et al., 2014) and neither a living nor non-living being (Kahn et al., 2012); suggesting that robots are seen as less intimidating than humans, which allows them to react to them in an anthropomorphic way. However, with the recent addition of rapport-building in the cognitive interview, it can be argued that there might not be a need for the KASPAR. As the rapport-building phase has demonstrated to make children feel comfortable and confide to the interviewer considerably more (Hershkowitz, 2011). In opposition to this, the use of robots has seemed to show the same effects as the rapport-building phase, as a study had shown that children were more likely to share the secret to the robot than to the teacher after being prompted equally in both conditions (Bethel et al., 2011). Therefore, the use of a robot could be more beneficial and less time consuming when gaining information from a child. In summary, the evidence above provides the KASPAR to accomplish what a human interviewer might not be able to in a cognitive interview. It suggests that the KASPAR can aid children in feeling relaxed, as this is important in salvaging memories of the witnessed event. But most importantly it can help the police interviewers by acting as a social mediator between the child and the interviewer. Police should therefore highly consider the use of a KASPAR for ASD children. To conclude, both uses of a sketch-RC and a humanoid robot appear to support ASD children in memory. Sketch-RC is an improvement from the standard MRC as it visually helps ASD children to see the contextual cues. The KASPAR also helps benefit in the interaction of the ASD child and the interviewer, which in turn allows the child to feel at ease and not impede their memory. Both recommendations have a significant amount of evidence to support their use, yet there have been a few limitations which interferes in their validity of being useful. It should however still be considered in the use of police interviews.", "positive": "t ? Okay Is it an app Oh lol ? Just use my email Oh no Why You have to pay ? No You have to pay to get in ?

{"id": "aug_75", "anchor": "Background Information Kenya Airways celebrated 43 years of operations in January 2020. However, according to passengers who have recently flown with Kenya Airways, the airline is performing poorly and not meeting customer expectations. Standards have decreased and the quality of the overall experience has worsened. Based on the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, this is evident. There have been many occurrences of lost luggage, poor customer service within the airport and on the aircraft, and insufficient in-flight entertainment. This report will address these complaints using the quantitative and qualitative data collected and analysed to make comparisons with and provide sufficient recommendations for improvement. Quantitative Research Secondary data, \"data previously collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand.\" (Malhotra, Nunan and Birks, 2017) was gathered for a 5-year period (2016 - 2020 inclusive). The data was then logged into an Excel spreadsheet, where the customer name, gender, travel month and year, cabin type i.e. economy, route i.e. international, origin and destination were provided along with the overall rating of the experience and individual rating of each characteristic. The sampling technique used was stratified sampling: \"\u2026a two-step process to partition the population into strata. Elements are selected from each stratum randomly.\" (Malhotra, Birks and Willis, 2013). Customers\u2019 reviews were picked based on the year but at random. This technique was also chosen due to its increased precision and the need to include important information i.e. all eight individual ratings completed. Customers who had not completed all eight reviews were ignored during the selection procedure as all eight reviews had to be completed to enable graphs to be drawn and comparisons and conclusions to be made. The question that rises from the data collected is: \"does gender influence the ratings of airline services?\" The two sample groups are male and female. A grouping variable t-test was carried out to work out the significance (appendix 2b). Since we have two groups, we want to compare the mean of \u2018Array 1\u2019 represented by males and \u2018Array 2\u2019 represented by females. As it is not known which gender scored a higher average rating, a two-tailed test using equal variances (2) needs to be carried out. Our results show a significance of 0.56 (to 2 d.p.), which indicates that it is not statistically significant. The significance value is more than 0.05 (p&gt;0.05) and the t-value is less than 1.96 (t&lt;1.96) which proves the results are not significant. Therefore, there is no difference in one gender rating services higher than the other, and there is no expectation that the differences will be replicated in other samples. To support this further, the airline characteristics ratings were split by gender, where the number of males were 50 and the number of females were 28. A table of the average individual ratings and standard deviation were recorded (appendix 2a) and a graph to represent the averages was drawn as shown on the next page. From the graph, it is evident that females gave lower ratings compared to males (except for \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019, where males rated it an average of 3.10 and females rated it 3.18). The biggest difference in ratings was for \u2018legroom\u2019 with a difference of 0.33. The standard deviation for males and females is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and there is a normal distribution. Therefore, it supports our hypothesis test of there not being a significant difference. An overall average airline rating was calculated and plotted in a graph as shown below. The graph shows that the most poorly rated characteristic was the \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 with a rating of 3.06. With all individual ratings being around 3, the overall rating can be assumed as an average of 3. We can compare these results with the overview of the official rating of the airline displayed on the TripAdvisor website (appendix 1b). The link for the website page is indicated by appendix 1c. The results are similar to the TripAdvisor ratings meaning the data collected is representative of the population. The standard deviation was also calculated for comparison and recorded in a table along with the averages (appendix 1a). From the table, it is evident that the standard deviation is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and that there is a normal distribution. To understand whether each characteristic has improved from 2016-2020, a table of averages was created (appendix 3). The table shows the total average for each year declining, where the best year was 2016 (average of 3.77) and the worst year was 2020 (average of 2.91) \u2013 the graph indicates this. A line graph was drawn to represent this information (below). The biggest decline was from 2019 to 2020, with a difference of 0.44. However, there was an improvement in the customer service from 2018-2019 with a rise of 0.57. In the year 2017, \u2018cleanliness\u2019 had the highest average (3.92) compared to the rest of the years. Again, this proves that quality of services has been declining. Therefore, the overall quality of characteristics has worsened. Qualitative Research To further support the quantitative analysis, secondary qualitative research was carried out. This was done by randomly selecting 25 customer reviews from the years 2016-2020 (5 for each year). All 25 reviews were analysed, and a coding frame (appendix 4a) was written up to categorise the factors further. For example, check-in and boarding was broken down into flights, luggage, and other. This was to understand in detail what the reviews highlighted. Appendix 4b indicates an example of an analysed positive review that includes characteristics such as value for money, check-in and boarding, seat comfort, food and beverage, and in-flight entertainment. For example, the customer (travel year 2020) commented on the \u2018seats being very comfortable\u2019. The average rating for seat comfort in 2020 was 3.10. Although there was a very minor decrease (0.05) from 2019, it can be assumed the seat comfort is steady and quality is not changing drastically. However, throughout the 5-year period, customer service was the most frequently complained about (airline staff and cabin crew) with a total of 12 negative complaints each. Airline staff includes staff who are not directly involved in the airport or aircraft, but are still part of Kenya Airways staff i.e. headquarters, call centres etc. The majority of complaints relating to airline staff were about staff being unfriendly, impolite, and incompetent. Some reviews mentioned that staff need to be trained as there was no sense of empathy. On the other hand, there was 1 positive review which mentioned the service being on a \u2018high level\u2019. Cabin crew also had 12 negative reviews, mostly about the staff not caring about errors made as well as not apologising. On the other hand, there were 9 positive reviews, making the total -3. This tells us that although there are positive customer service reviews, there are more negative ones meaning that customer service is worsening over the years. This can be also be proved by the graph shown by appendix 3 where the customer service rating fell from 2016 (4.00) to 2020 (2.90). This indicates greater confidence in customer service declining as there are frequent reviews to support this. Appendix 4c shows a negative review written by a customer in 2016. The review mentions customer service (airport staff and cabin crew) and food and beverage (qualityportion). Again, customer service was poor due to staff not caring or apologising. Furthermore, the airline had run out of vegetarian meals and no drinks were offered either. The coding frame shows the total for \u2018qualityportion\u2019 as -3, indicating that the airline is performing poorly in this service. Appendix 1a highlights that \u2018food and beverage\u2019 is the second lowest characteristic rated by customers with an average of 3.25. This supports the coding frame. On the other hand, there are three characteristics where the airline is performing well \u2013 legroom, seat comfort, and food and beverage \u2013 taste. The total scores based on the coding frame are 2, 3, and 2 respectively. Legroom had 2 positive reviews, both commenting on spaciousness, seat comfort had 4 positive reviews, and food and beverage \u2013 taste, had 4 positive reviews commenting on good and fresh taste. However, there were also negative reviews for seat comfort, where seats were not as comfortable and the taste of food not being great. Overall, Kenya Airways are doing well in these areas of service. Appendix 1a shows this for \u2018legroom\u2019 as it has the second highest average rating of 3.60, which supports the qualitative research and indicates greater confidence since reviews are consistent hence representative. Whilst appendix 4b has a positive review based on flying business class, other customers travelling in business class had negative experiences, based on poor customer service, rude staff and lost luggage. Therefore, this demonstrates inconsistency of the airline as customers are receiving different treatment even when demographics are the same. Rather, customers in business class are having the same issues as those travelling in economy, which raises the question as to whether Kenya Airways view all customers as equivalent despite paying extra for better service. Moreover, staff are lacking in training which leads to poor service regardless of whichever cabin customers are flying in. Recommendations Kenya Airways are performing at an average level (3.0) in comparison to competitors such as Qatar Airways (4.0) (Qatar Airways Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020) and Emirates (4.0) (Emirates Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020). While Kenya Airways are scoring close to an average rating of 4.0 in characteristics such as \u2018cleanliness\u2019 (3.71) and \u2018legroom\u2019 (3.60), they are scoring low in characteristics such as \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 (3.06) and \u2018food and beverage\u2019 (3.25) while receiving frequent complaints about services such as \u2018check-in and boarding\u2019 and \u2018customer service\u2019. Therefore, in order to excel, regain customer confidence and outperform competitors, many improvements need to be made throughout the airline. Firstly, improvements need to be made in customer service, mainly the airport staff and cabin crew. According to reviews on TripAdvisor, the cabin crew have a lack of care and are impolite towards passengers. As suggested by customers and to avoid future negative interactions with passengers, training needs to take place frequently e.g. every 4-6 months to ensure staff members are able to handle situations with care, show understanding and remain polite. Once training is complete, staff should be tested by answering scenario questions. Those who score less than 70% should undergo further training. The process can be repeated until they score 70% or over. Customers who feel comfortable and at ease are more likely to have a positive flight experience, resulting in greater positive reviews and higher ratings. Moreover, airport staff are being criticised of showing attitude and being unhelpful. Again, training needs to take place to avoid future negative experiences. A similar assessment as the cabin crew can be carried out with questions aimed more specifically for airport staff. Secondly, the in-flight entertainment needs to be improved. Passengers have complained about the equipment being broken and the movie list not being up to date. This can be quite frustrating especially when flying for long hours as there is no sufficient entertainment available to use. The first course of action should be for the movie listing to be updated (as mentioned in one review) on all aeroplanes and provide a wider array of entertainment as Emirates do (appendix 5). This will keep passengers entertained for the length of the flight. To avoid faulty equipment, all equipment should be checked before passengers aboard the plane. Finally, the portion and overall quality of food needs to be improved. There have been a number of complains written by customers who mention the portion size of food is little and sometimes drinks are not offered either. This can be seen as unacceptable, especially for those flying in businessfirst class as complimentary drinks are mandatory and passengers are paying extra (value for money). Portions need to increase as a result, by up to 25% to satisfy expectations and drinks need to be offered with every meal, as well as in between.", "positive": ", Thank you for the feedback.

{"id": "aug_78", "anchor": "This essay shall address the question \"What are the core assumptions and key features of the biological and psychoanalytical perspectives in psychology? In what ways are they similar and how do they differ?\". Each approach has their own individual assumptions and features, some of which are strengths and some of which are weaknesses, but each perspective has its place in psychological science as they can both be used in suitable situations, with the Biological approach being a more scientific, research based, utilitarian perspective, and the Psychoanalytical approach being a more theoretical, subjective, purity focused perspective towards psychology (Singh, 1991). One core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many of our adult behavior and feelings stem from childhood experiences. An example of this is Freud\u2019s theory of the Psychosexual developmental stages, a key feature of the Psychodynamic approach. This theory is characterized by the five stages of childhood development; these are the Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latent, and Genital stages (Brown, 1964). According to Psychodynamic theory, each of these stages must be successfully completed in order for the individual to progress, and failure to complete any particular stage will result in fixation. Fixation refers to the id\u2019s inability to transfer its pleasure-seeking focus from one psychosexual stage to the next. Without this natural progression, fixation will be shown in the behavior and feelings of the individual (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), for example someone with an oral fixation may take up smoking or start biting the nails, as they find pleasure in these oral-related activities. At this point, the Psychodynamic approach delves into the Biological side of psychology in a key feature referred to as \u2018Psychosomatic\u2019 disorders. This is the idea that unconscious psychological factors can produce physical manifestations, often seen as a disease or symptom, and that these disorders can be treated or cured by resolving the internal psychological cause, be it past trauma or a psychosexual fixation (Freud &amp; Riviere, 1961). This core assumption covers the \u2018nurture\u2019 side of the nature nurture debate as fixation tends to be the result of the way the child is raised, however the very presence of the psychosexual stages in everyone relates to the nature side of the debate. Another core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach is \u2018Psychic determinism\u2019. This is the theory that all behavior is caused by mental processes. This idea of all behavior having a psychological cause is shown in the psychodynamic theory of structure of personality. This structure is made up of three parts, the Id, Ego, and Superego, with the Id being the driving force behind our pleasure seeking behavior, the Superego counteracting the Id with the morality of our desires, and the Ego balancing the two to comply with the rules of society and reality (Freud &amp; Rickman, A General Selection from the Works of Sigmund Freud, 1953). Freud\u2019s theory of personality structure addresses the determinism versus free will dichotomy as, if all behavior is dictated by the interactions between the three structures, then the individual has no freedom in their actions. One last core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many feelings and behaviors are driven by unconscious forces. This is seen in Freud\u2019s theory of the Unconscious, which is in turn related to the theory of personality structure. The theory of the Unconscious separates the mind into three levels of consciousness; There is the Conscious which is our fully accessible thought, and then there is the Preconscious which can be accessed using psychodynamic techniques and the Unconscious which cannot be accessed, both of which operate in the subconscious level of thought (Freud &amp; Strachey, On Metapsychology: The Theory of Psychoanalysis, 1984). These are further related to the theory of personality structure as the different structures are located in different levels of consciousness. The Id operates solely in the Unconscious mind, the Ego exists mainly in the Conscious mind, and the Superego spans across all three levels of consciousness (Costigan, 1967). This interaction between the levels of consciousness is an example of the Psychodynamic approach\u2019s stance on the Idiographic versus Nomothetic debate, as the unconscious drives that affect behavior are generalized to humanity as a whole rather than individuals being affected by different unconscious forces or having differing levels of consciousness. A core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is that for psychology to be considered a valid science rather than a pseudoscience, then it must be treated as a science. In order for this to happen the scientific method must be upheld as it would be in any other scientific field of study, including using correct experimental methods such as Laboratory, Field, Natural, and Quasi experiments (Beatty, 2001). These are used to test hypotheses, the data from which is then peer reviewed. This core assumption relies on the Determinism argument rather than free will; For causational relationships between variables to be identified, particularly in regard to behavior, the assumption must be made that there is a cause at all (Green, 1987). In this case, the Biological is similar to the Psychodynamic approach. Another core assumption of the Biological approach, and perhaps the most important assumption in this approach, is the idea that many if not all behavioral characteristics are due to internal biological processes. This can include hormones, neuronal activity, and the genetic make up of an individual, as well as externally caused internal reactions such as brain damage (Kolb &amp; Whishaw, 2008). One way psychologists can study biological causes of behavior is through direct observation as the phenomena occur. Methods of this include brain scans such as MRI, ECG and EEG, and less brain-focused methods such as blood tests (Kalat, 2017). However, these methods can be quite invasive and are not always valid methods of measuring the inner-most structures of the brain. To address this issue, post-mortem studies are conducted (Groves &amp; Rebec, 1992). This is a key feature of the Biological approach where the brains of individuals, often with abnormal brain processes, are studied after death to observe the physical structure of these brains. As biological processes often take place on a scale too small to directly observe, biological psychologists often must resort to making inferences based on observable data, another key feature of the approach. A final core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is the idea of the evolutionary explanation for certain behaviors. The Darwinian theory of evolution features heavily in biological psychology, as some behaviors seem to be instinctual from birth. For example, particular phobias can be observed in young children even though the participants have never had any contact with the phobic stimulus before. \u2018Ophidiophobia\u2019 is an abnormal fear of snakes, and can be seen in children who have never before had any experience with snakes (Fredrikson, Annas, Fischer, &amp; Vik, 1996). The evolutionary explanation would suggest that this fear is instinctual and has been inherited as a survival mechanism to ensure the continuation of the individual\u2019s genes (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). This core assumption is an example of the nomotheticism of the Biological approach, as the theory of heredity of behavior is generalized to the entirety of humanity, as well as other species. The Biological and the Psychodynamic approaches both have weaknesses, some shared between the two approaches, some differing. Whilst Biopsychology takes a wider idiographic approach to behavior which can be considered to be overly simplistic and excessively generalized, the Psychodynamic approach uses an individual\u2019s childhood experiences to explain behavior, an idiographic method which may be considered to be too subjective to qualify as anything more than pseudoscience. The Biological approach uses the strictly monitored scientific method to prove hypotheses, using empirical data to demonstrate causational relationships between biological processes and behavioral phenomena (Breedlove &amp; Watson, 2013), whereas elements of the Psychodynamic approach uses methods that are dependent on the subjective interpretations of the psychologist using them, for example dream analysis (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), making it difficult to form concrete theories about certain behaviors. However, some assumptions of the two approaches can be seen as strengths of the different schools of thought. For example, the quantification of data used in many areas of Biopsychological research enables the results to be carefully and extensively analyzed to find correlations between variables and behavioral traits, and often lead to identifying causational relationships for feelings and behavior. The Psychodynamic approach uses more qualitative research which can be useful when producing Psychoanalytical treatments for individual patients. Also, the Biological approach takes a more utilitarian view towards psychology as a science. This means that the research conducted by Biological psychologists is focused around the practical uses of the results. It could be argued that this is partly due to the high financial cost of biological research, which requires grants and funding from organizations that would benefit from the results. The Psychodynamic approach has a more psychological purity point of view when it comes to research, meaning that some of the research and theories are produced purely for the philosophical understanding of behavior (Clark, 1980). For example, it could be argued that the theory of personality structure has very limited practical use as the Id, Ego and Superego cannot be directly interfered with, even though it is a possible explanation to help psychologists understand behavior. To conclude, both the Biological and the Psychoanalytic have some similar key features and core assumptions, and others that differ between the two. Each perspective has its own strengths and weaknesses and their own practical applications. Inevitably there will always be individuals who strongly disagree with one or the other, but given the chance each approach has something to offer modern view of psychology.", "positive": "Dear Mrs Botago, I've done some research into some of the top places in Helsinki you might want to try whilst you're there,and I'll copy in the bookings team so they have the addresses if you want them. The hotel I'd recommend is the Hilton Helsinki Strand, it was that or the Radisson Blu but the Hilton had better rooms with a view (can't beat a window-facing bed in the morning!). - 217 Euros per night - Has all your basic hotel stuff, plus Hilton is great anyway - John Steinbergin ranta 4, Helsinki, 00530, Finland. - +358 9 39351 - Check-in 2pm, check-out 12pm For breakfast I found a cute little cafe 'Kuuma' nearby the hotel, great reviews, typical continental-type food, looks great in the sun. - Pohjoisesplanadi (say that fast five times) 33, 00100, Helsinki, Finland. - +358 40 6757772 - Doesn't look like you need to book though, just so you have the number If you're up for a museum trip, go-to looks like the National Musuem of Finland. Google maps it, looks hard to miss, it's huge. There seems to be a great restaraunt a short walk from the city centre, 'Ravintola Nokka', again, great reviews, by the water, and the food looks incredible (think traditional Helsinki but with a modern feel to it?). - Kanavaranta 7 F, 00160, Helsinki, Finland. If you're looking for a souvenier for Esmerelda, there's a traditional-type souvenier shop 'Liopro' just off Helsinki's central market square, plus it gives you a chance to give the market a look. There's also a massive 'Flying Tiger' in the city centre, it's not traditional Finland but it's brightly-coloured Copenhagen-themed stuff, probably a better bet for a young kid if I'm honest. For that night out, there's a brilliant looking rock club called 'Tavastia' nearby, live music and apparently one of Europe's oldest rock clubs?

The hotel I'd recommend is the Hilton Helsinki Strand, it was that or the Radisson Blu but the Hilton had better rooms with a view (can't beat a window-facing bed in the morning!). - 217 Euros per night - Has all your basic hotel stuff, plus Hilton is great anyway - John Steinbergin ranta 4, Helsinki, 00530, Finland. - +358 9 39351 - Check-in 2pm, check-out 12pm For breakfast I found a cute little cafe 'Kuuma' nearby the hotel, great reviews, typical continental-type food, looks great in the sun. - Pohjoisesplanadi (say that fast five times) 33, 00100, Helsinki, Finland. - +358 40 6757772 - Doesn't look like you need to book though, just so you have the number If you're up for a museum trip, go-to looks like the National Musuem of Finland. Google maps it, looks hard to miss, it's huge. There seems to be a great restaraunt a short walk from the city centre, 'Ravintola Nokka', again, great reviews, by the water, and the food looks incredible (think traditional Helsinki but with a modern feel to it?). - Kanavaranta 7 F, 00160, Helsinki, Finland. If you're looking for a souvenier for Esmerelda, there's a traditional-type souvenier shop 'Liopro' just off Helsinki's central market square, plus it gives you a chance to give the market a look. There's also a massive 'Flying Tiger' in the city centre, it's not traditional Finland but it's brightly-coloured Copenhagen-themed stuff, probably a better bet for a young kid if I'm honest. For that night out, there's a brilliant looking rock club called 'Tavastia' nearby, live music and apparently one of Europe's oldest rock clubs?

{"id": "aug_88", "anchor": "Deductive and Inductive reasoning are examples of propositional logic to construct thoughts into a valid argument. Deductive reasoning begins from a general statement that leads to a certain conclusion (Johnson-Laird, 2000; Rips, 1999; Williams, 2000). For example, \u2018all noble gases are stable, helium is a noble gas, so helium is stable.\u2019 Inductive reasoning begins with specific observations which lead to a conclusion that is likely to explain the observation and the conclusion may be used to predict future specific occasions (Johnson-Laird, 2000). An example would be if all children in one day care like Legos, it could be assumed all children like Legos. A similarity between the reasonings are that they are both used to provide a valid argument and are used often. Another similarity is that both reasonings follow premises in which they base their argument on. A difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is that deductive reasoning begins with a hypothesis and tests the hypothesis via an observation whilst inductive reasoning begins with observations and then moves towards a theory. This is because deductive inference is based upon theory whilst inductive inference is based on observations. There is also a difference in validity between the reasonings as deductive reasoning is more precise as if all the premises are true then the conclusion is true for example, \u2018if all dolphins are mammals and all mammals have kidneys, all dolphins therefore have kidneys.\u2019 However, even if the premises are true in induction, the conclusion is still not definitely true. For example, \u2018if the first button I get out of a bag is a red button, the third button I obtain from the bag is red, therefore it is inductive logic to conclude all the buttons in a bag are red.\u2019 Therefore, deduction is more accurate and quantitative whilst induction is more general and qualitative. Due to this, induction is used more in everyday life as it is harder to obtain a sequential set of facts that are known to be true in deduction.", "positive": "y perfect, thank you Thank you!

{"id": "aug_89", "anchor": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs \u00a3157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a caf\u00e9. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a caf\u00e9 to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Caf\u00e9 Kluuvikatu 3, caf\u00e9 which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit.

After your message I looked at Christina Scharff\u2019s \u2018Repudiating Feminism\u2019, looking at one chapter in particular. I assume from the essay specification that you want us to look at one chapter specifically? (And with the word count and having read and made notes on my specific chapter I assume that\u2019s all that would be plausible). Assuming that that is ok to go ahead with, I just wondered to what extent the 2500 word essay cannot overlap with this essay? For example, if there was a question regarding feminism generally, would I not be able to do this question because my 500 word essay is also about feminism, or is it more specific than that for example intersectionality? (Not that that is the topic in the text I have found, just an example). Thank you again for your help, I really appreciate it. Hi That\u2019s fine, I can find something different to look at.

However, I\u2019m slightly confused as whenever I am looking up the sub genres of crime fiction, they always seem to focus around the detective as a means to decipher the sun genre, whereas this piece doesn\u2019t have that layout necessarily. I didn\u2019t know whether there was any first-person theory so to speak that you were aware of and could give me some advice on, because as of yet I am struggling to find relevant theories.

{"id": "aug_98", "anchor": "The Stroop Test, first developed in 1935 by John R. Stroop, was designed to study the effect of interference when presented with pairs of conflicting stimuli (Stroop, 1935). This original study showed that the verbal identification of the colour of a word is delayed by the word being a colour-word and incongruent to the font colour (Allport, 1990). The Stroop Test shows the effect of inhibition, a central executive function used to override an immediate response to a stimulus, demonstrated by the overriding of the semantic meaning of the word shown in order to correctively identify the font colour (Eysenck &amp; Keane, 2015). It is also an example of automaticity in reading (Hunt &amp; Ellis, 2004). Automatic processes are not conducted with intent, they are not able to be thought through before they happen, and do not take up any conscious processing capacity; The Stroop test demonstrates this with the automaticity involved when the stimulus is first seen (Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975). The fact that the Stroop test covers so many aspects of cognitive processing makes it a significant study in the field of cognitive psychology. Variations of the study also provide a range of results on which hypotheses can be based. Based on past research, it is predicted that when the colours are incongruent, the time taken to respond to the font colour will be longer in comparison to when the colours are congruent. Method Participants 123 participants were used from a volunteer sample of Aston University 1st Year Psychology students, ranging from approximately 18-22 years old. Design The study was a within subjects design, with each participant responding to both congruent and incongruent stimuli, this being the independent variable; whether the font colour was congruent with the colour meaning of the word. The dependent variable was the response time for the participants to report the colour of the font. Materials Superlab was used to create and conduct the study, and using the Superlab timing feature enabled accurate response times to be obtained. A set of simple jpeg images were used as stimuli. These showed various colour words in various coloured fonts (red, blue, green, or yellow), with half of the stimuli\u2019s meaning and font colour being the same (congruent) or different (incongruent). The participants could use Superlab\u2019s response option to input the font colour of each stimulus using a set of coloured computer keys, and once having familiarised themselves with the order of the keys they were able to respond as soon as they had processed the colour of the stimuli. Procedure Firstly, participants were given a full briefing on the experiment and it\u2019s aims, as past studies had shown that there was little-to-no effect of participants knowing the experiment aims. They were asked to sign a consent form, allowing their data to be used in the experiment report. Instructions were given verbally; however, this was unnecessary as all participants were already familiar with the experiment. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to the font colour of the stimuli, but ignore the meaning of the words shown. The participants were told to respond by tapping a coloured computer key corresponding with their response. Their response times were recorded by the Superlab program. The stimuli were presented one at a time in a random order, with congruence and incongruence also randomised and counterbalanced. Results Only 115 out of the total 123 participants inputted results, causing n to equal 115. There was a significant difference between colour congruent and colour incongruent conditions (T = 1932.00, n = 115, p &lt; 0.001). As mean reaction times were larger in the incongruent condition than in the congruent condition, the participants took significantly longer to identify font colours when they were incongruent with the meaning of the colour word. The standard deviations suggest that there was a high variance in both conditions, but more variance in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition. Discussion The results obtained from the experiment showed that participants took significantly longer to correctly respond to the font colour stimulus when the font colour was incongruent with the word meaning than when the font colour was congruent. This is concurrent with past experiments in the same area and is consistent with the original hypothesis. The results collected can be used to explain many aspects of perception and internal processing. The fact that the semantic meaning of the stimulus words can affect the time taken to respond to the visual colour of the font supports the Flanker Effect (Sanders &amp; Lamers, 2002) and in turn the theory of Late Attentional Selection (Lavie &amp; Tsal, 1994), as it suggests that unattended stimuli can influence our conscious thoughts and actions. However, there were some methodological issues with this study. In this experiment, every participant received a slightly differently worded brief as there was no standardised instructions created for the study and all briefs were given by different investigators. There was also the issue of multiple trial situations. Sections of the participant group undertook the study at different times of day, different days and in different rooms. This may have influenced the results collected and should have been controlled for by having all participants complete the study at the same time under the same conditions. There is a wide range of modifications to this experiment that could be made to study the different aspects of the original Stroop test, one of which is to explore the effects of context and internal state of participants on response time. Again, there are several ways this could be conducted in order to produce evidence to support real world debates, one of which is to test the effects of chemical imbalances on the Stroop test. Although it could be modified further to make it more applicable to the real world, at a basic level the original Stroop test could be conducted under the influence of various chemical substances, e.g. Alcohol, to test the effects of these chemicals on perception of target stimuli in the presence of distractors.", "positive": "med to be, he\u2019s checking if can make the No, we can do a proper brunch in the sun instead?

{"id": "aug_101", "anchor": "Within the study of Psychology, the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspectives have contributed immensely in relation to its similarities and differences of its core assumptions and features. As the assumptions within the Biological perspective consist on behaviour being solely a result of biology such as neurotransmitter and genetics; in comparison to the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective which consist of behaviour-based experiences within the environment and the unconscious. In the following essay, I will discuss the key features and assumptions of both perspectives revolving around their similarities and differences. The Biological Perspective adopts the nature approach to behaviour, as its assumptions solely revolve around the concept of behaviour is hard-wired. This is evident within its explanation for disorders such as Schizophrenia as Gottesman (1991) found that Monozygotic twins hold the highest percentage of 48% who are at a \u2018Lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia\" in comparison to the 1% of the General population. This statistic supports the nature adoption of the biological perspective, as it states that behaviour is a result of Heredity as result of monozygotic twins sharing 100% of their genes. On the contrary, the Psychoanalytical perspective adopts both nature and nurture approach within its assumptions. As Freud proposed the assumption that our behaviour is controlled by the tripartite construction of the mind consisting of the Id, Superego and Ego. Freud (1949) states that the Id \"contains everything that is inherited\"; this concept of inheritance similarly aligns with the biological perspective of nature having an influence on behaviour. As the Id is considered as the primitive part of the mind which includes innate instincts \"which are sexual in nature and the death instincts such as aggression\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 118). Alongside the nature aspect of this perspective, this perspective also adopts a nurture approach to behaviour in relation to the environment also having a major influence on behaviour. This is evident within the super-ego component of Freud's theory of the mind which is shaped by societal values and family upbringing. This is developed during childhood essentially acting as a conscience within behaviour and moral guidance in \"attempting to thwart id desires\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 119). In addition to the super-ego, this perspective emphasis on nurture is also evident within Freud's Psychosexual stages of development. As the process of each stage contributes to the development of one's personality, for example during the ages 4-6 gender identity is formed through Oedipus complex (for males) and Electra complex (for females) during this Phallic stage the child will experience unconscious sexual desires for their opposite-sex parent. This unconscious desire is resolved through the child identifying with the same sex parent, therefore, leading the child to form an appropriate affection for their opposite-sex parent. However, Freud proposed the idea if this conflict was not resolved it would result in complex behaviours such as promiscuity and narcissism. Despite, both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective varying within the nature or nurture approach to behaviour, both perspectives possess a deterministic view of behaviour. As the core assumptions of the Biological Perspective holds the view that behaviour is solely a result of genetic factors and biological components. Similarly, the Psychoanalytical perspective upholds the same notion of determinism in its explanation of behaviour being controlled by instinct drives alongside with the environment also having control over behaviour. A further difference within these perspectives is the approach in relation to explaining its core assumptions. The Biological perspective adopts a reductionist approach in its explanation of behaviour as it attempts to explain behaviour through simple components such as genes, brain structure and neurotransmitters. This is evident within findings that serotonin and dopamine have a \u2018signalling effect on later-life in relation to somatosensory, anxiety and depression' (Suri et al, 2015, p. 318); therefore, this supports the reductionist view of the biological explanation as it reduces complex disorders such as depression to neurochemical basis. Alternatively, the psychoanalytical perspective adopts both a reductionist and holistic approach to explaining behaviour. The use of reductionism is evident within Freud's' explanation of reducing behaviour to the instinctive drives within the unconscious mind. Despite this, this his approach differs as he also adopts a holistic view of behaviour as he considers the individual. This is apparent within the case of Anna O, who suffered from Hysteria a psychological disorder which involved psychological stress manifesting into physical symptoms such as \u2018multiple personalities, speech difficulties, bizarre hallucinations, and inability to drink' (Benjamin, 2007, p. 116); these physical manifestations were a result of her grief from her father's death. This case supports the holistic feature in the Psychoanalytical perspective, as it considers other factors alongside unconscious drives which contribute to behaviour in comparison to the core assumptions of the biological approach which is narrow in its assumption. Furthermore, alongside the difference in their approach to explaining behaviour both perspectives also vary in investigating their core assumptions. The biological perspective is reliant on quantitative methods which provide objective measurements such as brain scans to measure the brain and behaviour; this is apparent within methods such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) which measures the blood flow of the cerebral cortex; consequently, thus providing support for the key biological features of the perspective. This is evidently seen within research into disorders such as Depression as fMRI scans showed that depressed patients \"demonstrated more pronounced connection between the right frontal eye field and cerebellar area \"in comparison to healthy patients who demonstrated \"showed stronger connectivity between more than 20 frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions of interest and cerebellum\" (Bezmaternykh, D.D. et al, 2018, p. 734). Alternatively, the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective revolve around qualitative methods which are subjective in nature. This is apparent with the case of Anna O as discussed above which is a central feature within the Psychoanalytical Perspective as it paved a way for the use of subjective methods such as talking therapy; therefore, providing a deeper insight on the individual than solely on numerical data as evident above within the biological perspective. By the same token, both perspectives also differ on carrying a scientific discipline whether its assumptions and features can be falsified. This is evident within the consistent falsification of the biological approach. This is evident within the contribution towards the theory of Neurons through the work of Golgi and Cajal. As Golgi produced the \u2018first clear pictures of nerve cells' through a staining technique from this he inferred that the nervous system consisted of many neurones but was physically connected to each other (Goodwin, 2015 pg. 74-75). In opposition to the work of Golgi, Cajal proposed the idea that neurones were not physically connected to each other using Golgi's staining technique to support his claim. As result of the falsification of Golgi's theory, Cajal\u2019s work has had a major contribution to the key features of the biological perspective due to the gap between the neurones to now be known as the synapse, this being a pinnacle feature of the biological perspective to explaining the behaviour through neurotransmitters. From the consistent vulnerability to falsification within the features of the biological perspective, it is apparent that the perspective holds a scientific discipline. However, it can be argued that the Psychoanalytical perspective holds a similar scientific discipline in relation falsifiability as Hunt (2009) refers to Freud's work being \u2018fiercely attacked on one ground or another' therefore providing the psychoanalytical approach with some scientific discipline as its assumptions can be both \u2018strengthened and weakened' (pg. 225). This is evident within the development of Neo-Freudians such as Alfred Adler (1870-1937), who rejected the oversexualised perspective associated with Freud's psychoanalytical perspective but focused on the social aspect regarding primary determinates of behaviour such as environment and uniqueness of individuals. Therefore, introducing a different branch from the Psychoanalytical perspective as Individual Psychology. Finally, despite possessing a similar element of scientific discipline, the psychoanalytical perspective contrasts the biological perspective regarding its scientific credibility due to the subjective nature present within the core assumptions. This is evident within the feature of the Psychosexual stages regarding the development of gender as Freud argued that female gender identity was formed from possessing penis envy as they believed to have been castrated. This theory of female identity essentially within psychoanalytical perspective essentially lacks the scientific discipline in comparison to biological perspective as this feature within the assumption appears to base on \u2018Freud's views of women' than evidence and fact. (Benjamin, 2007, p. 130). In conclusion, despite both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective holding majority of differences within their assumptions alongside the nature of their key features holding similarities both perspectives have successfully become an integral part of Psychology today.", "positive": "i can we watch this tomorrow please Thanks You haven\u2019t watched it yet right Oh wait do u not know the girl she\u2019s from the gospel group They\u2019re both Ohhh wow yeah you should listen to they are amazing I would recommend - , , Hey what time do u finish work today x Mehn okay coz I wanted to call you and after work to see what other day we can go swimming this week coz asked me She hasn\u2019t said yet and yeah true I\u2019ll let her knowww Looooooooooool I don\u2019t know you know it was just a random thought I just started laughing", "positive_attacked": "i can we watch this tomorrow please Thanks You haven\u2019t watched it yet right Oh wait do u not know the girl she\u2019s from the gospel group They\u2019re both Ohhh wow yeah you should listen to they are amazing I would recommend - , , Hey what time do u finish work today x Mehn okay coz I wanted to call you and after work to see what other day we can go swimming this week coz asked me She hasn\u2019t said yet and yeah true I\u2019ll let her knowww Looooooooooool I don\u2019t know you know it was just a random thought I just started laughing", "label": 1}

The mid-section of the report measures how well ASOS have met the needs expected by its customers and analyses and addresses the core issues behind this using methods such as the 5 why\u2019s and affinity diagrams which aid in drawing out what the overall problem is and areas for improvement. The final sections of the report focus on addressing and eliminating issues by employing the 5\u2019s and process mapping. Lastly overall recommendations are made for ASOS. Please find all relevant diagrams and documents in the Appendix at the end of the text. Introduction and Background The company that I have chosen to investigate is A.S.O.S. (Abbreviated for \u2018As Seen on screen\u2019) They are an online fashion and cosmetics retailer, founded in the year 2000 and based in the UK, London. 20 years later, the company now ship their products to 195 countries worldwide and sell over 850 brands on their site, alongside their own range of clothing and accessories. The company employs over 40, 000 s people as a part of this global operation. I chose to look at ASOS because they are a company, I have personal experience as a customer with, as well as knowing other people who have shopped with them also. I also thought it would be interesting to look at a business that operates solely online as this is the future of a lot of commercial activity. DEFINE (Value Added Case) The CTQ trees (figure 1) detail what needs are important to me as a customer at ASOS. The needs I identified were; good customer service, quality products and a high-quality website. Good customer service is important to me as there is not a physical store whereby, I can interact with the staff face-to-face or be persuaded by the physical environment to continue returning. Therefore, I can say that the integrity of the brand to me as a customer is dependent to on how well its customer service performs. If an order is not processed correctly, I expect customer services to fix the problem in order for me to decide to purchase from them again. These needs are further established by the following quality drivers; time taken to receive my order and how quickly a response is provided to my enquiries. Again, since the transaction happens online, as a customer I deem the brand more trustworthy if I have a positive experience of my product or refund consistently received quickly, and communication isn\u2019t slow. This is reassuring to me and suggests that they care about my experience as a customer. I would further break these quality drivers into measurable metrics seen in figure that uphold ASOS to a high standard. If these metrics are followed, ASOS should be able to successfully provide good customer service. MEASURE (SERVQUAL) I asked 5 customers to complete a SERVQUAL questionnaire regarding the RATER aspects of ASOS (Basu, 2000), including aspects of the service which are tangible (i.e. clothes and accessories) and intangible (i.e. delivery and refunds). The results of the questionnaire are represented in figure 2, which outline the gap between ASOS \u2019customer expectations and actual perceptions once they have experienced the service and products. According to my results the areas which ASOS need the most improvement are empathy and assurance as they both fall below customer\u2019s expectations of an \u2018excellent online retailer.\u2019 However, the graph shows responsiveness to have low expectations (in comparison to other areas) as well as perceptions. This is significant as I identified responsiveness as quality driver in the CTQ diagram. Although, this also suggests an opportunity for ASOS to be competitive as customers do not have as high an expectation for online retailers to be very responsive based on their past experiences. If ASOS implement this in the next stages of their six-sigma process they may have found a way to increase their competitiveness. The results also highlighted that in both Tangibles and Reliability customer expectations were exceeded, therefore ASOS can be said to have a high-quality performance in these areas. MEASURE (Cause and Effect Case) After considering the results of the SERVQUAL questionnaire and the needs highlighted in the CTQ diagram. I have chosen to analyse the causes behind two areas; Slow responses, which was the lowest scoring activity on the questionnaire and a lack of range in sizes as I have friends who have had issues with this when shopping from online retailers such as ASOS. In the diagram (figure 3) I have thought of potential causes for these issues; in order to identify ways to fix the core problems and thus improve the customer experience. Of the causes that I have identified, the most important to me as a customer are the fact that staff are uncertain of how to respond to emails. This is significant because if staff are unsure of how to respond then my query may not get answered quickly or with a response that is unsatisfactory or doesn\u2019t adress what I am asking. The other significant cause is ASOS being slow to re- stock. This is undesirable as ASOS are a fast fashion retailer, not being able to meet this expectation, defeats the purpose of their business model and would make me look to other retailers in the market. ANALYSE (5 Why\u2019s and Affinity) In the next stage of my research I created a flowchart asking the question \u2018why?\u2019 five times to further analyse the issue and conclude a root cause. From this exercise and use of an affinity diagram (figure 5), I identified and was able to group that the root causes were management related. There were internal issues regarding staffing, recruitment, training and time management that could be the cause of difficulties in responding to customer quieres and being slow to re-stock orders. To summarise, ASOS, like other companies in the same industry, often experience high turnover and sometimes can be slow to recruit new people in efforts to try and improve their retention level. ASOS could recruit internally if staff training was prioritised, thus giving staff the confidence to take on management roles when they become newly available. Overall, these issues fall under the responsibility of the Human resources department. With this information I will begin generating some potential solutions to improve the efficiency of the human resources at ASOS. IMPROVE (6 Hats and 5 S\u2019s) Following the previous analysis stages, I thought of some plausible solutions to the HR issues that are potentially affecting the level of customer service at ASOS. I adopted the six-hat tool to analyse my options. The best solution I thought of was to outsource training for the marketing staff, primarily those that deal with customer service; however, it is important that all staff in this department have the same training to support each other where short-staffed. The goal of outsourced training would be to instil the confidence of staff and introduce methods of working that improve efficiency, without placing burden on the management staff. Wearing the black hat, (the most powerful), highlighted that ASOS have to be financially able to undertake this and consider which budget this will come from. I also considered whether training would actually make a significant impact or not, using the green hat in response, I decided that specific staff could be asked to undertake the training, if they find the training successful then the training could be extended to more departments. The Six sigma principle \u2018standardise\u2019 can also be applied here by creating posters or handbooks that can be placed around the office as a quick guide to responding to frequent enquiries, leaving time to respond more carefully to more complex enquiries. Circling back to the green hat, a computer program could be internally developed that scans emails for key words, listing these as quick enquiries to respond to. Above all ASOS should make it a priority to highlight customer service excellence in their company statement to encourage staff internalising these values. \"To win in services, a firm must develop a passion for service quality within the entire workforce.\" (Foster S. Thomas, 2016) IMPROVE (PDCA) At this stage the PDCA tool (Basu, 2000) As mentioned in the previous stage, the solution to the lack of training problem would be to outsource training. Therefore, the pilot study would be testing whether outsourced training will improve the efficiency of staff so that they can respond to emails faster. This will be done by giving staff and management a questionnaire that details the task they are least efficient in before training and another after the training to measure improvement. If a significant improvement is seen (large difference between before and after training scores), more employees across the organisation could also undertake the training. One of the considerable risks with the study is the financial ability of ASOS to support the training. In this case, I have chosen this method because it is easily scalable and will not cost much in the beginning but affords all departments time to plan and budget for this opportunity. The RACI chart (figure 7) shows that there is a shared responsibility between the human resources and managers to communicate internally and the responsibility of the training agency to provide a good service. It is also important that human resources consult marketing managers about which staff should undergo the training and make sure that they are informed. There is also accountability on the part of the staff to gain as much as they can from the training as it is primarily for their benefit. IMPROVE (Process Mapping) Six sigma process mapping is an effective tool for documenting a series of necessary steps and display of the value stream so that each step can be analysed for value creation (Quality improvement tools, 2018). Documenting process maps before and after changes (figures 8 and 9) highlights where value was created for ASOS\u2019 customer service team. In this case the value created is in the staff training although visually the difference is not vast it demonstrates the effects of training mentioned in the previous section. Staff before training were more likely to ask management and seek approval for their responses, delaying the time customers received an answer, resulting in unsatisfied customers who do not return. Recommendations Another useful recommendations I would offer to ASOS would be to continuously update their FAQ (frequently asked questions) section. After successfully dealing with a complex query, consider that this may be useful to other customers and will reduce the workload in the long run as more customers will consult this beforehand. When a clothing item is delivered, the return sheet could also direct them to this page also. The more ASOS can engage and provide help to customers the more that this need for good customer service (as mentioned in the define stage) is being fulfilled.", "positive": "That colour is actually blush pink \ud83d\ude0c Yes Do you know her size? *morning I dont think it was keen on the Ayamase Nope This one is still talking \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude29 Please remember to get me a computer mouse and would like one too Ive seen this one very cutie Okay babyyy \ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffd Eh Party starting..\ud83c\udfb6 Testing Dont forget has a lesson at 6 tomorrow \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 nooooo And the boy just sat there Calling There may be a purple one, but that one is unscented.

{"id": "aug_103", "anchor": "The period of adolescence is a time where behaviour is characterised by impulsivity, increased risk taking and an affinity for peer groups (Spear, 2010). During no other period in the lifespan is the prevalence of death so high relative to health, with Steinberg (2013) reporting a dramatic spike in self-inflicted behaviours such as car accidents and crime. Adolescent behaviour and the reasons for its occurrence has posed a particular question for researchers. The duel systems process model proposes that adolescent typical behaviour is caused by a developmental imbalance between the subcortical socioemotional system implicated in sensitivity to rewards and novelty, relative to the cognitive control system responsible for impulse and emotional control as well as decision making (Shulman et al, 2016). The model hypothesises that the early activation and maturation of the ventral striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) in early adolescence increases one\u2019s propensity for sensation seeking whilst the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is still maturing, therefore attenuating impulse control (Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2011). It is predicted that sensation seeking behaviour increases at the early stages of adolescence and levels off as adulthood is reached, following an inverted \u2018U\u2019 shape trajectory. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob (2011) assessed this using longitudinal data from over 7000 participants aged 12-24, looking at self-reported changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking. They found that mean levels of impulsivity declined through adolescence and levelled off when participants reached their mid-20s, consistent with neurobiological research suggesting heightened activation of the ventral striatum in early to mid-adolescence relative to children and adults (Barkley-Leveson &amp; Galv\u00e1n, 2014). This supports the claim that adolescent typical behaviour is a product of nature due to the profound influence of brain structures and their relative levels of maturity on sensation seeking behaviour. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob\u2019s (2011) research is one of the first to report this trend using longitudinal data and to utilise such a large sample, representative of a diverse population. Furthermore, the use of such a large data set reduced the chance of type I errors. However, caution should be taken when drawing conclusions due to the risk of social desirability and response bias when using measures of self-report. It has been asserted by some researchers that adolescents possess the ability to evaluate risky decisions to the same level as adults (Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006), begging the questions as to why this age group engage in risk behaviours to such a degree? Observational data suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents heightened propensity for risk (Albert et al, 2013) with researchers suggesting adaptive benefits such as increasing peer status and peer affiliation with desirable social groups (Spear, 2010). Steinberg &amp; Gardener (2005) assessed the effects of peer contexts on risky decision making in 3 age groups including adolescents (13-16), youths (18-22) and adults (24+). All 306 participants completed 3 measures of risk orientation including 2 self-report measures and a computerised driving task named the Chicken Game. In this task participants were required to make decisions about whether to advance the vehicle once a traffic light turns from green to yellow (meaning an impending red light) with the possibility of a car crash if the car advances through a red light. Participants were randomly assigned either the peer condition where they would complete the task with 2 others or the alone condition. Steinberg &amp; Gardener found that each group engaged in comparable risk taking when alone but increased risk taking when in the presence of peers, more pronounced during middle and late adolescence. This suggest adolescents\u2019 susceptibility to peer influence relative to adults when taking risk, implying the role of nurture and social contexts in adolescent typical behaviours. This study has important implications for interventions seeking to reduce risky behaviour amongst adolescence (i.e. juvenile delinquency) suggesting attention should be directed towards increasing resistance to peer influence in young people. However, this study has arguably low ecological validity as it unable to capture the complex dynamic of risk taking with peers outside of a laboratory setting. In conclusion the cause of adolescent behaviour appears to be a combination of both nature and nurture influences, with research suggesting that peer influence may increase the brain\u2019s risk and reward system sensitivity (Albert et al, 2013). Subsequently, the duel process model and effects of peer stimuli may co-influence risky behaviours seen in adolescents as young people spend most of their time with peers (Spear, 2010). Therefore, the claim that adolescent behaviour reflects the influence of nature more so than nurture is not supported. Research suggest adolescence is the greatest risk period for the emergence of psychopathological disorders, with mental illness affecting 1 in 5 young people (Powers &amp; Casey, 2015). In light of this, this essay shall seek to critically discuss how brain development may facilitate the high prevalence of psychopathology during adolescence. Stress has been considered an important factor contributing to adolescents\u2019 vulnerability to internalising disorders, namely anxiety (Romeo, 2010). Brain areas identified as being implicated in this increased vulnerability includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which undergoes significant maturational changes and a reawakening during puberty (Spear, 2010). The HPA axis is responsible for controlling stress-induced hormonal secretion in response to stressors and does so by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation (McCormick et al.,2010). Once released, ACHT acts to increase the production and release of glucocorticoid hormones, which then act upon the brain to predetermine future responses to future stress stimuli. Using a battery of acute stressors, Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) assessed the hormonal stress response of prepubescent rats, compared to that of adult rats and found a greater, more prolonged ACHT and corticosterone response in the younger rats compared to adults. Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) suggested that it takes twice as long for these hormones to return to baseline level in premid-adolescent rats following stress stimuli relative to adult rats. Reflective of the results seen in animals, researchers have speculated that anxious individuals may show a delayed HPA axis recovery following a stressor, which in turn may make them slower to adjust to novelty, giving rise to psychopathological vulnerabilities (Spear, 2010). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results to human behaviour because of the use of animal data. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess levels of glucocorticoid in human adolescents because of the natural diurnal release rhythm it follows (Spear, 2010), meaning animal studies have provided a valuable opportunity to investigate this, whilst having strong experimental control. Furthermore, animal research is able to bypass the ethical implications to be considered when conducting human research (Eiland &amp; Romeo, 2013). Attention deficithyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be defined as inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity relative to an individual\u2019s age, that interferes with their functioning (Shaw et al., 2012). Onset of ADHD is around 7 years (occurring before puberty) and is prevalent in over 5% of children worldwide (Friedman &amp; Rapoport, 2015). Research has suggested that brain development through late childhood and adolescence is an important factor contributing to ADHD. Shaw et al (2007) assessed this using a longitudinal MRI scan study of 223 ADHD diagnosed participants matched with 223 typically developing (TD) controls. Shaw and colleagues found a marked delay in ADHD in achieving peak cortical thickness throughout the cerebrum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). This delay was most pronounced in the middle and lateral PFC, implicated in higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and planning, where peak thickness was achieved 5 years later than TD controls. In addition to this it was seen that the primary motor cortex conversely showed early maturation in ADHD (peaking age 7 years), when compared to controls (peaking age 7.4 years). Shaw and colleagues speculated that the delayed developmental trajectory of regions implicated in higher-order motor control, paired with the early maturation of the primary motor cortex may account for symptoms seen in ADHD i.e. poor motor control. This influential study was seen to be the first longitudinal neuroanatomic research evidencing the theory of delayed cortical maturation in ADHD, due to the advanced in MRI techniques seen in recent history. However, it should be noted that the results cannot endorse differences in intelligence and sexual dimorphisms seen in ADHD, despite their effect on cortical development because they strictly controlled for in the design. To conclude brain maturation and development in adolescents, relative to adults seems to have implications for various psychopathologies. Spear (2010) suggests for disorders like ADHD where onset occurs just prior to adolescence, motor control regions may show developmental anomalies, whereas disorders with adolescent aged onset i.e. anxiety, show developmental differences in the frontal regions. It can be speculated that the PFC\u2019s immaturity in adolescents relative to adults, may be sensitive to the reawakening and prolonged effects of the HPA axis. However, brain development is not the only factor giving rise to psychopathologies in adolescents with mental health varying by person. Instead some researchers propose the stress-diathesis model, suggesting an interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental stresses, predisposing certain individuals to psychopathologies during adolescence (Spear, 2010).", "positive": "r Dr , I was wondering if you could help me with a couple issue I am facing, the first being with the system points.

{"id": "aug_107", "anchor": "The Monty Hall Dilemma (MHD) was a game transformed to puzzle format by Nalebuff (1987) and the aim is to choose the door with the grand prize behind it. Aside from the grand prize, the two other doors hold small gifts, a \u2018lesser gift\u2019 door is revealed, and contestants are asked whether they would like to switch their original door choice. The correct solution, given by Marilyn Voss, is that one should always switch. The contestant's original decision has a 13 chance of holding the grand prize, and once a door with the smaller gift is disclosed, that door has a 03 chance of holding the prize, meaning that the last door now has a 23 chance of holding the grand prize. Switching increases the chances of the contestant winning, but the problem is that when given the choice, most of them do not switch. Granberg and Brown (1995) found that less than 15% of participants switched during lab replications. One reason for this may be that when asked how they would feel hypothetically, participants said they would feel worse if they lost after switching compared to losing with their original choice. Gilovich et al. (1995) found and concluded in a similar study that participants who switched experienced greater pain from their decision and explained the idea that \u2018regrettable actions pack a bigger punch than inactions\u2019. A supporting idea is given by Petrocelli &amp; Harris (2011) as they found that individuals tend to have increased levels of counterfactual thinking when they switch to a grand prize and lose. They argue that this reduces the ability to learn the solution of the problem and that counterfactual thinking influences memory distortions which has an effect on future decisions. Another reason people may choose to stay rather than switch in dilemmas such as the MHD is the idea of an \u2018illusion of control\u2019 (Langer, 1975). Granberg and Dorr (1998) found that switching increased when a different person made the final decision. In this instance, it appeared as if individuals who made the decision stay or switch after an initial person, felt less obligated to stay. The authors suggest that the individuals who make the first decision believe that they must stick to the decision they made - without any grounds. However they did find that this wasn\u2019t something that affected individuals long-term, as they averaged out to the same switch rate as a control group. Even though it seems the majority stick, there are instances where people choose to switch. As mentioned before, rates of switching increase when there are manipulated factors. Friedman (1998) conducted a study where participants received $0.40 for the grand prize and $0.10 for the lesser for 10 rounds. He found the switching rate increased from 10-30% by the end of the rounds, suggesting that participants were learning to make the right decision. More interestingly, in the second half of his experiment he placed participants into one of four groups (larger incentives, record-keepers, a conflicting advice group and a compare group that were told around 60% of participants who switch win). Friedman found in each condition that there were increasing numbers of those that switched - up to more than half, but no one condition reaching 100. This presents the idea that people can do better in environments when given opportunities to understand the game. So, this could be the reason underpinning why some choose to switch, the fact that they can learn and understand how to play the game. Monetary incentives may also have a role in encouraging participants to learn at a faster rate. A systematic review by Saenen et al. (2018) found that there were a few reasons why people sometimes decided to switch, including superior math skills, working memory and inhibition ability. However, they argued only behavioural performance improved and that there\u2019s no hard evidence that individuals gained understanding of the problem. They also mention that behavioural performance isn\u2019t consistent and that it\u2019d be difficult to obtain consistent results, just by manipulating one factor that influences individuals to make the decision to stay. The correct solution to win in the MHD is to switch and research has attempted to show that participants are more likely to switch when they are in situations where they are able to learn the rules of such games. However, switching is something a majority of people fail to do at first glance due to many reasons, including illusions of control or the value they put on their feelings after deciding. Moral Reasoning (MR) is the process of using logic to determine whether an action or decision is right or wrong. Utilitarianism and Deontology, established from Bentham (1748-1833) and Kant (1724-1804), are forms of MR and are associated with systems for decision-making. Deontological forms of MR argue that the right thing to do depends on actions\u2019 intrinsic value, e.g. the act of lying is bad. Holyoak and Powell (2016) discuss deontology and say that it acknowledges individuals\u2019 unique positions in situations. They mention a number of factors that occur within deontological ethics such as, doing versus allowing (actively harming versus allowing harm), intentions (being judged for an action\u2019s intentions) and preferential treatment for important relationships. In terms of systems, deontology associates with system 1 response characteristics, which refers to fast and primitive evolutionary thinking. Utilitarian forms of MR are seen as consequential and the theory argues that the right act is the one that maximises the greatest utility for the group of individuals. Holyoak and Powell address that utilitarianism is linked to the idea of economic utility and cost-benefit analyses. This differs from deontology as it focuses solely on the best consequences which are seemingly the total wellbeing of the involved individuals. Utilitarianism is perceived as a system 2 response, which is analytical and uses new evolutionary tactics. Supportive evidence for two systems in MR was given by Greene et al. (2001). They found that in instances of the personal and impersonal versions of the trolley dilemma (deciding whether to push a lever to save the 5 lives or deciding to push a large individual), individuals who made \u2018utilitarian responses\u2019 (to push) took longer to think, and brain imaging revealed that brain regions more closely related to working memory were active, compared to those who made deontological responses \u2013 who showed more activity in brain regions related to emotions. Differences in neural activity support the idea that there are possibly two different systems used in moral decision-making. So far, utilitarian &amp; deontological forms of MR appear very different (actions versus consequences), even via neural structures. However, critics suggest that deontological reasoning is another form of utility. Cohen and Ahn (2016) argue for a single process model rather the dual systems. They asked participants to rate items and people (to display differences in individual utility) and once incorporated into the trolley dilemma, they found correlations with the reaction times &amp; probabilities of making a deontological decision and how similar items\u2019 utility value were. This could suggest that deontological decision-making may just be what the decision-maker holds valuable to them. A similar idea of this lack of distinction was proposed by Ditto and Liu (2011) who argued that those who make deontological responses use consequentialism. They asked people how many individuals would need to be saved in order for them to push another individual and found that participants who gave the deontological response spoke about higher likelihoods of the individuals escaping the train track and low possibilities that pushing the man would stop the trolley. This suggests that even when they make their decision, they\u2019re using consequentialism, suggesting the theories aren\u2019t separate. More criticism is proposed on whether the distinction between the two theories is valid or whether it\u2019s a misconception, as Gray and Schein (2012) argue that morality is defined by the combination of two minds (moral agents- the actors, and moral patients- the sufferers), As a combination, they argue that neither deontology nor utilitarianism can account for MR on their own. Because of this, they also bring up the idea that paradigms that set utilitarian and deontological reasoning against each other provides false concepts of MR. Likewise, Kahane (2015) discredits the use of sacrificial dilemmas- which much research on MR is founded on - to assess the difference between any forms of MR. One reasons he gives refers to the idea that in some dilemmas, the option to sacrifice puts the individual in a position where the decision could be made out of self-interest. Deontological forms of MR appear to be about an agent\u2019s intentionality whereas utilitarianism refers more to consequences. There is conflicting consensus about whether they\u2019re two different systems but there's criticism about the fact that as theories, they aren\u2019t necessarily distinctive, more importantly, the use of dilemmas to assess the forms of MR are not beneficial and do not account for MR in the real world. Dilemmas like this are also snapshot instances and its very questionable as to whether these theories can describe MR outside said dilemmas.", "positive": ", Thank you!

I accept the risks listed and understand the actions I must take. The only query I have is of my placement tutor, I was not aware I had one!? How would I go about finding out whom this is so I may make contact with them? Thanks again and best wishes, Hello, I filled all of these forms in when I first secured the placement \u2013 a good few months back now! Am I expected to fill these in again? Good Evening, Thank you for your message, it is great to hear that I\u2019m eligible for the Erasmus funding. I have filled in the form as requested and attached it to this email. Let me know if you need anything else from me and I will do my best to get it back to you as quickly as possible! Many thanks Hello, I uploaded these previously to so will send them to you directly to avoid any more confusion! I guess there must have been some issues when the placement was initially cancelled on your end!? Let me know if this is okay. Thanks This should be everything you need. Please let me know if anything else comes up. Many thanks Hello, I must admit that I am finding this very difficult at the moment. Understandably, coronavirus has thrown everything up into the air and caused lots of confusion, disrupting my flights and all of my paperwork. However, having now filled in all of your requested forms twice and pestering my employer almost daily to satisfy your requirements, I would ask that you offer me some leeway as the many requests have only made this more difficult for me. I want to make a good first impression with my employer and it has been hard to maintain that with the university trying to cancel my placement and me constantly messaging with questions and updates. I am concerned I am being made to look reliant on help and that it will start me off in a poor way with my new role. The document I sent over to you was exactly what was sent to me when I asked for a job description. It is all that myself and the employer have agreed upon about the day-to-day runnings of the job, even I don\u2019t know anymore than that and it will be me doing it! Myself and the employer are content that the job description under the \u2018role\u2019 section on that document is more than satisfactory. If you truly want to dispute the definitions between a role description and a job description then of course, I will have to message my employer again. I would just like you to understand how unprofessional I am being made to look and how frustrating it is for all parties involved.

{"id": "aug_120", "anchor": "Dear Madam, Here are the details of the itinerary items I have created for your conference trip to Helsinki between the 2nd and 4th of September 2021. I have found a 4-star hotel situated 0.4 miles away from the city centre. For two nights it will cost \u00a3216. It is also situated close to the Seurasaraselka waters so, if we book a room with a view you will always get to see the water. This is \u00a316 over budget but it was the best option in regards to tourist reviews and location. Caferino Obas is a cafe, which is only a ten-minute walk away from the hotel and they offer a great breakfast menu. They offer a wide range of options and alternatives for those who are allergic to Seafood. Helsinki Museum is a twenty-minute walk from the hotel but it is specifically a museum popular with tourists for being able to \"uphold Helsinki's heritage\". Therefore you will learn a lot about the city you are visiting. Finland's national dish is Saute\u00e9d Reindeer. So I have found a very popular restaurant called Restaurant Lasipalatsi which offers this dish. They have a wide range of sides to go with this dish and before booking the restaurant we are able to call them up beforehand and warn them about your seafood allergy. Therefore the food will be catered for you specifically. There is a souvenir shop called Mikebon which offer a wide range of gifts. Especially toys which may be great for your children. Finally, for the evening I have found a Rock Music Club called Tavastia. Since you love live music I have found a club that offers Helsinki's popular genre and the club itself is quite old so this holds some heritage too. I hope you like the suggestions.

{"id": "aug_121", "anchor": "In this essay, I will mention the key features of the psychodynamic approach, such as Freud and the unconscious mental processes, and those of the biological approach \u2013 genetics, heredity and evolution. Core assumptions, such as the role of nature and nurture in the key features, will also be remarked upon and compared. This essay will allude to how these perspectives are different, their stands on the nature-nurture debate, and how they are similar \u2013 such as the influence of childhood. The key features of the psychodynamic approach are mostly synonymous to Sigmund Freud, and his research with unconscious mental processes. This approach focuses on the influence of the \u2018unconscious\u2019 and how our behaviour as adults is rooted from childhood experiences (Jarvis, 2000). Freud derived theories about the mind and personalities, coming up with theory about the conscious, preconscious and unconscious, how Freudian slips showed what you are truly thinking but trying to hide, and the It (Id), I (Ego), and above-I (superego) (Freud, 1993 as cited in Jarvis, 2000). This means that this approach looks at how past experiences are reflected in current behaviour. Like the psychodynamic approach, the biological approach has a researcher well known to the field \u2013 Charles Darwin. The key features of this approach focus on the role of genetics and evolution. Evolution refers to the way genes in our DNA can change over generations due to the role of \u2018natural selection\u2019. Twin studies have been helpful in researchers understanding to the extent genes play a role in behaviour and how much the environment may play a role in this also. For example, twin and adoption studies show how the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher if you are genetically similar than dissimilar (environment also plays a role as concordance is not 100%) - Cardno &amp; Gottesman (2000). This means that this approach focuses on the interaction of genes and the environment - how nature can influence nurture and nurture can influence nature. A difference between these approaches, is the way that these perspectives view the influence of nature and nurture. The psychodynamic approach concentrates on the role of the unconscious and childhood experiences being the influence on adult behaviour. Therefore, psychoanalysts, such as Freud,, emphasise the role of nurture over nature. In contrast, the biological approach concentrates on the way nature and nurture have a similar influence on each other \u2013 the role of genetics as well as environmental influences. Another similarity with the approaches is that they both have socially sensitive research that have impacted on people negatively. According to Jarvis (2000), in the 1950s and 1960s, psychiatrists following psychodynamic concepts blamed autism on poor parenting. Tavris and Wade (1997) [as cited in Jarvis (2000)] described a case study that illustrated the negatives of taking a purely psychodynamic approach. This approach is reductionist. Its theories are derived from case studies such as Anna O and the work or Tavris and Wade and it tries to explain everything in accordance to psychodynamic theories. Reductionist approaches included socially sensitive research which as a result significantly harmed people \u2013 like the eugenics movement. The work of Galton, fixated on the role of genetics, influencing the eugenics movement. His focus on certain traits being better in society and the fixation that these traits are hereditary only led to the research being abused and hurting thousands of people (Fairholm, 2011). Eugenics was very popular to begin with but eventually it led to a way to discriminate, segregate and sterilise (,and in Nazi Germany, systematically murder) millions of people deemed to have undesirable genes. This dark side of psychology was reductionist and ethically immoral. The eugenics movement attempted to use just genes to explain everything about people. As a result, by focusing only on genes and inheritance, the importance of the environment was ignored (Fairholm, 2011). Neurodevelopmental disorders show that genes are not the only factor to developing a disorder, for example, while Fragile X Syndrome is a purely genetic disorder, Down Syndrome and Williams Syndrome are not hereditary (passed from parents to offspring) even though its genetic, and Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is purely environmental \u2013 no genetic origin. (Witton, C., 2019). This means that separating genes and the environment is not appropriate as neurodevelopmental disorders here show that nature has influence over nurture (Fragile X Syndrome) and nurture has influence over nature (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). The understanding developed from biological theories and discoveries has aided in pharmacological treatment for psychological disorders and the potential understanding on how these disorders develop. The discovery of neurones (by von Waldeyer-Hartz) and eventual discovery of the Synapse (by Sir Charles Sherrington) led to the unearthing of neurotransmitters and their functions \u2013 and their influence on the brain and psychological disorders such as serotonin with depression. This has led to biopsychology to be considered scientific due to objective and controlled research. Similar to this, Freudian theory on ego defences such as displacement, denial and projection are considered today in psychodynamic therapy. These are considered in therapy as psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals, see psychological problems as rooted in childhood and dealing with the root cause, and gaining insight into trauma, can help relieve symptoms. An example of this used in the past would be the case study of Anna O \u2013 bringing trauma into the consciousness by talking about it resolved the symptoms of her hysteria. However, this approach includes vague untestable concepts that lack specifics required to assist in Psychology being considered a science. For example, the Oedipus Complex is almost impossible to measure and the use of case studies, such as Anna O reduces the validity of this approach and it being scientific as participants are not typical of the population. (Jarvis, 2000) Anna O is a case study in the psychodynamic approach which focused on how the mind served to adapt the individual to the environment. The mind presents hysteria to unresolved trauma, the mind adapting the individual to its environment and past experiences. Based on this, I suggest that psychodynamic approach has functionalist perspectives. However, with Freud\u2019s insistence of interpreting and analysing dreams, this approach has certain structuralist qualities. The psychodynamic philosophy analyses the mind based on behaviour that presents itself, such as Freudian slips and dreams, which is partially what structuralism is based upon. Therefore, the psychodynamic approach is an interaction of functionalism and structuralism with a lean towards functionalism. Similarly, the biological approach can be viewed to be an interaction of structuralism and functionalism. The approach analyses the mind and localises areas for specific jobs, such as with genetics and chromosome x or y on the last pair which determines gender or Broca\u2019s area for speech aphasia. This is structuralist. Where this approach links with functionalism is through evolution. Where the mind has adapted an individual to their environment. This is evident with evolutionary fears \u2013 such as fear of heights, the dark and snakes. This behaviour increased survival in the past. Another example of this is the cuteness of babies. This is also a survival factor as infants are unable to look after themselves. As a result, this \u2018cuteness\u2019 factor elicits a caregiving response and the need to look after infants and protect them from the dangers. (Kringelbach, Stark, Alexander, Bornstein &amp; Stein, 2016). A similarity between the biological and psychodynamic approach are that both are deterministic approaches rather than demonstrating free will in their theories. While the biological approach approaches the nature and nurture debate as it being an interaction between the two, it is largely a deterministic approach rather than free will. Biological determinism is where biological concepts or processes determine our thoughts and behaviours (Fairholm, 2011). This approach rejects a total genetic viewpoint, especially because of the eugenics movements, but elements of this approach is still deterministic. An example would be the argument for the MAOA gene and aggression. Some have argued in the past that because one may have this gene and commit and act of aggression, this excuses their behaviour. However, this cannot be accepted in the current Criminal Justice system and that people must take responsibility for their actions as other people with this gene can control their aggression (Holmgren &amp; Winterdyk, 2011). This example shows that the biological approach focuses on deterministic theories rather than free will. Moreover, the psychodynamic approach leans more on determinism than free will. This is evident in the fact that Freudian concepts argue that behaviour in the current is influenced by past experiences in childhood. This leaves little room for free will as a result. Another example is through the ego defences suggested by Freud. These are considered an automatic phenomenon to protect a person from their trauma, for example repression of trauma or displacing anger from the object of their anger to someone more vulnerable \u2013 the person isn\u2019t aware they are doing this consciously. Therefore, this removes the aspect of free will. At first glance, one would assume that the biological approach and the psychodynamic approach are different, that because one focuses on genetics and evolution and the other focuses on early childhood experiences and the unconscious, that there are no similarities. However, this essay shows that, aside from the basic key features, the perspectives are more similar than first assumed. They have people that are well known to their areas \u2013 Freud and Darwin. Furthermore, both indicate that childhood has influence over behaviour \u2013 the unconscious desire and fears presented in Freudian theory and environmental influences on typical body development (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). There are differences in the perspectives, such as the psychanalytical approach considering nurture to have more influence but the biological approach considering the interaction of nature and nurture having equal amount of effect on behaviour. In conclusion, the biological and psychodynamic are much more similar than what would first be assumed.", "positive": ", Thank you very much for your very quick reply and for setting me at ease.

So I did a study placement at . I chose to do a study placement as I wanted to improve my language skills and they had a well renowned language programme at the University. The experience was literally one of the best things I've done in my life. I met so many people of different nationalities and made some amazing friends as well as really improving my language skills (written, spoken and in particular Grammar). If you want anymore information let me know. It was really hard to adjust at first and I was really homesick. However, I just tried to integrate myself into all of the student events and talk to as many people as possible. As soon as I made friends then I felt a bit more settled and it took me a while to feel comfortable in using day to day. However, you'd be suprised at how nice people are and they just appreciate trying to speak in so just really go for it. I wish I had been a bit more confident to start with. It's important to say as well that I was going to do a half study, half work placement at first but decided to stick with study as that was what was best for me. But I would highly recommend doing half and half as you get the best of both worlds and also it looks good employability wise. If you feel that you really struggle with grammar etc then I would definitely suggest half a study placement as it will aid you in final year when it comes to dissertation and assessments etc. Yes please message me whenever and I will keep checking in on you as I really understand how difficult this year can be especially in the current climate.

{"id": "aug_125", "anchor": "In the United Kingdom in 2019 there was 1.6% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Postnote, 2020). The high number of ASD children means that it is imperative to have correct measures in place when they are put through police interviewing. There are policies in place to support children under the age of 18 who classed as \u2018vulnerable witnesses\u2019 (impairment to intelligence and social functioning), by giving them assistance to provide the best evidence possible in court (Ministry of Justice, 2011). However, in our justice system there are still issues which need to be corrected, as current research shows that when a child is labelled with \u2018autism\u2019 the evidence they provide is questioned in credibility by jurors (Crane et al., 2018). On top of this, the difficulties present in ASD children could significantly impact the information that is gathered by police, as they lack communication, social skills (Knott et al., 2006) and also impairments in memory (Bruck et al., 2007). There are two recommendations which will be examined to help police gather evidence in ASD children. The standard cognitive interview includes four main techniques (K\u00f6hnken et al., 1999). Mental context reinstatement (MRC) is one segment of the interview that requires the person to go back in time to remember the emotions they felt and the physical environment around them (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2011). However, ASD children have impairments in their memory, specifically in their autonoetic consciousness (Gardiner, 2001), this therefore, means that they might find the process of MRC difficult. Evidence has shown this to be true as people with autism recalled fewer details in the MRC interview (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). This is especially relevant to ASD children, as they already tend to recall fewer details than typically developing (TD) children (Williams et al., 2006). Therefore, police need to find an appropriate way of aiding recall for ASD children as the MRC has shown to exacerbate their memory. The inclusion of sketching as a form of context reinstatement (Sketch-RC) rather than the normal MRC before a free recall has been seen to be beneficial for ASD children in recall (Mattison et al., 2014). A study that delved further into this had used ASD children and TD children to watch a video (Mattison et al., 2018), and then had compared sketch-RC and MRC, following with a free recall afterward. A probed recall phase was also used to gain further detail, but it was entirely based on what the children had stated in their free recall. In this case, the findings supported the usage of sketch-RC in interviewing as ASD children recalled 25% more than the ASD children in the MRC condition. This could be explained by the encoding specificity theory (Tulving, 1972); which states that the ASD children recalled better because the cues were present in encoding and retrieving, so, the sketches helped facilitate these cues more than just mentally reinstating the context. In contrast, Henry et al (2017) had conducted a similar study but additionally looked into \u2018verbal labels\u2019 and \u2018registered intermediary\u2019 interviews, there was no improvement in recall to the ASD children in the Sketch-RC or the other two interviews. This comes to question whether Sketch-RC does improve memory recall or were there methodological issues that caused the study to not find any significant results. This study did have its limitations, as Dando et al (2018) had brought this to light. Participants were aimlessly placed in either a live condition or a video condition, 83% of TD children and only 30% of ASD children were placed in the live condition. This could have impacted the significance of the results because ASD children are more perceptive of their surroundings, as they process sensory information around them differently (O\u2019Neill and Jones, 1997), therefore the children could have encoded the information differently when streaming a video version rather than witnessing the live event, impacting the validity of the results. Even though there might be drawbacks to the article\u2019s methodology to cause the results to not support sketch-RC, there are still several studies that reinforce the idea of how positive the sketch-RC can be in real life. For instance, a field study had looked into children\u2019s accounts of sexual abuse. The use of drawing had significantly increased the amount of detail recalled, rather than just a standard interview (Katz &amp; Hershkowitz, 2009). With this in mind, sketch-RC has shown to be valuable in the real world as well as in just studies, so police should highly consider using this method to capture more information. The takeaway message is that the MRC in a cognitive interview might not be an appropriate measure to gather information from ASD children. So, the use of sketch-RC might be considered more appropriate than MRC when conducting a cognitive interview for ASD children, as it allows them to access memories using the contextual cues from their sketches. This will be fairly important in real life as each information given by the witness can help in finding the perpetrator or piecing the investigation together. Consequently, social interaction is vital in police interviewing, as it requires a verbal exchange of information. However, ASD children tend to lack the social skills to interact and confidently communicate to get their ideas across (Knott et al., 2006). The cognitive interview, therefore, might pose a problem, as ASD children will consider it socially demanding (Johnson, et al., 2018), which might cause them to become distressed and impact their retrieval of information (Quas &amp; Lench, 2007). On account of this, the advancements in technology can allow police interviews to be conducted with robots rather than humans to minimise the distress (Wood et al., 2013). There have been significant benefits in the use of robots, as they have shown to improve the social skills of TD children (Robins et al., 2004; Aresti-Bartolome and Garcia-Zapirain 2014) and in ASD children (Wainer et al., 2010). The creation of \u2018Kinesics and Synchronization in Personal Assistant Robotics\u2019 (KASPAR) has shown to be beneficial to ASD children. An observational study had been conducted to see how children would react to the KASPAR with adults present (Robins et al., 2009). They had found that the ASD children interacted positively by smiling, touching, and gazing at the KASPAR. Also, an important finding they had found was that it helped facilitate social interactions with the co-present adult. This could be beneficial in police interviewing as it will help support the ASD child in feeling comfortable, but also can act as a social mediator for when ASD children are being interviewed. Nevertheless, evidence has shown that the KASPAR does come with its challenges, as a study had found that children were scared of viewing the robot because of how it looked (Huijnen et al., 2018). This would undermine the use of KASPAR, as it would cause further distress and impacting the ASD child\u2019s memory. Opposed to this view, a reinforcing study by Wood et al (2013) had comparable results to Robins et al (2009) using the KASPAR. However, the study involved the children to be interviewed in a similar manner to a police interview, as they had used questions that would retrieve facts and not feelings from the children. The eye gaze and interview duration were much longer when the interviewer was a KASPAR rather than a human. This key finding links with ASD children as eye contact is a necessary part of communication (Nation and Penny., 2008). This adds support to the use of KASPAR in police interviews as it will help ASD children to feel at ease and help in memory recall; but also this study helps put in perspective how the use of a robot could help ASD children in a police setting. ASD children\u2019s perception of the KASPAR allows us to understand why they feel more closer to robots than humans. They seem to identify them as toys (Peca et al., 2014) and neither a living nor non-living being (Kahn et al., 2012); suggesting that robots are seen as less intimidating than humans, which allows them to react to them in an anthropomorphic way. However, with the recent addition of rapport-building in the cognitive interview, it can be argued that there might not be a need for the KASPAR. As the rapport-building phase has demonstrated to make children feel comfortable and confide to the interviewer considerably more (Hershkowitz, 2011). In opposition to this, the use of robots has seemed to show the same effects as the rapport-building phase, as a study had shown that children were more likely to share the secret to the robot than to the teacher after being prompted equally in both conditions (Bethel et al., 2011). Therefore, the use of a robot could be more beneficial and less time consuming when gaining information from a child. In summary, the evidence above provides the KASPAR to accomplish what a human interviewer might not be able to in a cognitive interview. It suggests that the KASPAR can aid children in feeling relaxed, as this is important in salvaging memories of the witnessed event. But most importantly it can help the police interviewers by acting as a social mediator between the child and the interviewer. Police should therefore highly consider the use of a KASPAR for ASD children. To conclude, both uses of a sketch-RC and a humanoid robot appear to support ASD children in memory. Sketch-RC is an improvement from the standard MRC as it visually helps ASD children to see the contextual cues. The KASPAR also helps benefit in the interaction of the ASD child and the interviewer, which in turn allows the child to feel at ease and not impede their memory. Both recommendations have a significant amount of evidence to support their use, yet there have been a few limitations which interferes in their validity of being useful. It should however still be considered in the use of police interviews.", "positive": "For the CEO's day at Helsinki I have suggested for them to stay in the Hilton Helsinki strand which costs $130 a night, it is close to the water and is near to the central of Helsinki, so they will be capable of travelling for not a long amount of time.

Therefore, the conclusion and overall argument is logically true however it may or may not be realistically true. For example, it could be said that \"all strawberries are a fruit\" (specific statement), another statement could be \"the bag is full of fruits\", (specific statement), which for inductive reasoning would lead to a general conclusion, being \"the bag is full of strawberries.\" This conclusion may or not be true as we are unsure of the contents in the bag and it could include other fruits such as grapes or apples etc. On the other hand, deductive reasoning has a different approach to arguments where instead of having a specific argument leading to a general conclusion, the subject has a general argument which isn\u2019t really specific to the end conclusion however within the deductively valid argument the conclusion is specific, therefore it is both logically and realistically true (Jonathon and Evans, 2013). An example of this is if there was a general statement such as \"all strawberries are fruits\" and another general statement such as \"all fruits have seeds\" then the specific conclusion would be \"strawberries have seeds\". This conclusion is logically and realistically true. Furthermore, another difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is deductive reasoning problems can be resolved without real world knowledge. This is because it is argued that deduction is more likely to be deliberate and involved with rule-based practises compared to induction which is more influenced by context, which suggest that there are two alternative and distinct forms of reasoning (General Books, 2013). In 1996 \u2018Wasons Selection task\u2019 was developed which was based on the ruling \"if P then Q\" - if P is true then so is Q. For example, participants will be shown four cards I, K, 4,7 and be told the rule \"if a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other side.\" Participants would then be asked to turn over the minimum number of cards they think would be sufficient enough to prove the rule. However, most participants struggle with this task as they may overlook a card that could falsify the rule (Eysenck, 2004). This is because the participants have insight into the logical structure of the problem. This is based on the insight model developed in 1972 which suggested that the chances of being successful on a task depends on the participants level of insight (Eysenck, 2004). Insight has three levels, the first being no insight therefore participants will choose the cards mentioned in the rule because they think only confirming the rule is priority. In this example the participant would choose the cards \"I\" and \"4\" and could be identified as matching bias. Partial insight is the second level when the participant realises that confirming and falsifying the rule is important, therefore they would turn over \"I\", \"4\" and \"K\", the \"K\" would be falsifying. Full insight is then the highest level of insight and is when the participants will only select cards that falsify the rule, meaning the \"K\" and \"7\" card would be selected. Furthermore, it could be said that the task is so difficult due to the abstract content that is used on the participants. In conditions where concrete content is used opposed to abstract content, 60% of the participants correctly selected the P card and not the Q card (Manktelow , 1999). Subjective Expected utility is the theory on how to make optimal decisions. Five main axioms are used as a foundation to the theory which maximizes an individuals expected utility in decisions made. Predictions have been derived from initial axioms in order to test whether the theory can be used from psychological approach (Chavas, 2004). Transivity is the first principle where if A is preferred to B and B to C then A should be preferred to C. Nevertheless, in 1969 Tversky suggested that if decisions are complex, order preference becomes intransitive as individuals can only focus on one attribute in decision making. Invariance is the second where A is preferred to B or B to A therefore choice preference shouldn\u2019t impact their description. However, research has proved that if they are presented with two versions of a problem its more likely that there\u2019s a preference for A to be in version one but B to A in version two. Independence is the third principle where if A is preferred to B, it shouldn\u2019t depend on anything the choices have in common. However, the Allais paradox states that when presented with two, individuals will prefer A to B in gamble 1 but B to A in gamble 2. Within the independence principle it states that preferences should not be affected. (Chavas, 2004). In addition, another explanation is the prospect theory which states when it is time for decision making, a person will assess their gains and losses from a decision relative to certain reference points, for example the present situation they are involved in or the way in which a decision is framed. This is done as an alternative to basing decisions on an absolute value. (Chavas, 2004) Problem solving is defined as a goal that is to be reached but an individual is not sure on how to do it. The problem in this diagram is about a student who cannot achieve higher than a C in their maths class, which is leading them to get a low outcomes, but they desire to get above a C in their overall GCSE math class. The problem that I have described above in the diagram is a well define problem which has three elements to it, being a starting state (getting lower grades than a C in math), a goal state (getting above a C) and a fixed set of operators that transforms these states (feedback and working on past papers). The method of problem solving that is being used is algorithmic procedures which means that there is a solution to the problem however the downfall is it may be a very slow process to get to the end goal. Within this diagram it displays simple steps to get to the end goals such as working on past papers and gaining feedback, however this may take a long time depending on the individual. For example, if their working at grade is a D it may take less time and they could be at a C within 3 week. Nevertheless, there is a definite solution solutions to the problem. Evidently this state action tree is using a heuristic search method, more specifically the hill climbing technique which means to always choose the move that will get you closer to the goal state (Manktelow, 1999). Within my diagram above every step that is taken, whether that is feedback or past papers, it will bring the student closer to its goal state of getting above a C in math. Creativity is defined as an insightful or unusual solution which is valuable (Pope, 2005). A solution that is creativity must be valuable and useful in one way or another and has to be understood and noticed by society. There are four main perspectives that could be used to discover more about creativity, which is based on studying creative people, the creative process, the creative product of the environment of creativity. It was said that creativity can be assessed using the psychometric approach which Guilford in 1956 distinguished into two ways of thinking. Convergent thinking is when the individual converges the correct answer and the best answer to a problem. Whereas the other type of thinking that Guilford suggested was divergent thinking which is when the individual develops many different solutions to the same problem, and this requires more flexibility, wider thinking and originality. Divergent thinking was considered a form of creativity which Guilford attempted to conceptualize, however an issue with this was that these tests can often confuse creativity and intelligence or creativity and originality therefore it may be hard to distinguish. Furthermore, another way that creativity can be assessed is the biographic and autographic approach where Wallas in 1926 identified four stages of creative process. First being preparation which is when background knowledge is absorbed, also incubation which is when the problem is dismissed for any reason. Wallas also said that inspiration was art of the creative process which is when the solution is developed for the first time. Lastly, verification is part of the creative process when the individual confirms whether the solution was successful or not. These stages were proved with evidence regarding the assessment of creativity, however with the exclusion of incubation. The incubation period has still remained controversial regarding the creativity process.", "positive": ", I was wondering if I would be able to start officially from instead, sorry for any inconvenience.

However, having now filled in all of your requested forms twice and pestering my employer almost daily to satisfy your requirements, I would ask that you offer me some leeway as the many requests have only made this more difficult for me. I want to make a good first impression with my employer and it has been hard to maintain that with the university trying to cancel my placement and me constantly messaging with questions and updates. I am concerned I am being made to look reliant on help and that it will start me off in a poor way with my new role.

It is all that myself and the employer have agreed upon about the day-to-day runnings of the job, even I don\u2019t know anymore than that and it will be me doing it! Myself and the employer are content that the job description under the \u2018role\u2019 section on that document is more than satisfactory. If you truly want to dispute the definitions between a role description and a job description then of course, I will have to message my employer again.

This would allow us to all go on our trip and would be a fantastic option for us.

Alternatively, if needs be we can cut our trip short and fund travel back to the UK for our members so we could be available on . This would have significant financial implications for us so would not be ideal but is a possibility if the presentations can be arranged on that date.

{"id": "aug_137", "anchor": "This essay will look to answer the question above, \u2018To what extent does sport foster and reproduce a hyper-consumerist culture?\u2019. Hyper-consumerism refers to \u2018the consumption of goods for non-functional purposes and the associated significant pressure to consume those goods, exerted by modern capitalist society, as those goods shape one\u2019s identity\u2019 (Wikipedia, 2020), in simpler forms, \u2018a consumerism for the sake of consuming\u2019 (Lunning, F., 2014). There are a number of ways that the theory of hyper-consumerism can be applied to the subject of sport and sports relation to hyper-consumerism. However, there are a number of ways that sport can be considered as not fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism and instead an area affected by hyper-consumerism. There are a number of highly popular professional sports that over the last 3 decades have seen the change of consumerism within the professional sport. Hyper-consumerism in a number of professional sports. One professional sport where there has been an abundance of growth in consumerism and profitability is professional football. The Premier League teams of England are projected to pull in \u00a35.4bn in the 202021 season (Deloitte, 2020). With \u00a31.35bn (25%) of this coming from commercial business for the Premier League clubs. The Premier League generates the most revenue out of all the top 5 European football leagues by roughly \u00a31.5bn over the closest league, Spain at \u00a33.38bn. The scale of these figures show the high expenditure within football leagues but especially the Premier League. It also shows the size of the commercial brands of the Premier League teams. Specifically the annual revenue of the big 6 Premier League teams totalling \u00a34.13bn (Sports Pro Media, 2020). This revenue causes high expenditure on transfers and wages for players. This lavish spending fosters a lifestyle that is presented to fans and these fans want to be a part of whether its buying a jersey of the team they support or buying a season ticket to watch their team every weekend. These actions are a perfect example of hyper-consumerism culture with these goods being non-functional and possess a significant pressure in the supporters life and take control of their lives when the games are being played. Although hyper-consumerism does play a role within sports, as presented above, however, is the growth of revenues within football fostered by hyper-consumerism not the other way round? Hyper-consumerism is a theory that has been around longer than the growth in revenues for sports with its close association with globalisation and cultural homogenisation (McGregor, S., 2007). With this considered if there was a lack of globalisation and cultural homogenisation would we see the high revenue of the top global sporting leagues such as the NFL, NBA, MLB and the Premier League, which all are valued between \u00a35bn and \u00a311bn (AP Sports Editor, 2020). Without the human nature of greed that causes hyper-consumerism would we instead see these leagues having significantly lower revenue. This is just one factor that could suggest in my opinion that hyper-consumerism fosters sports and the growth of sports. It can also be considered that hyper-consumerism and sports are actually symbiotic, in which they work in a close relationship as one grows the other grows and vice-versa. Another factor that supports the idea of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism is that of the growing expenditure of households on sports. According to a study by Sheffield Hallam University, the average household expenditure on sports in 2002 was \u00a311.38, however, as of 2018 the average household expenditure on sports was \u00a376.80 (Gov.uk, 2019). This is a 674% increase in expenditure over 16 years or 42% per year. This tremendous growth in expenditure is similar to the growth in revenue of the most popular UK sporting league, the Premier League, which over 16 years saw its revenues grow from \u00a31.25bn (Deloitte, 2003) to \u00a35.4bn, a growth of 432% or 27% . This shows as a professional sport league grows so does the expenditure by a household. Thus showing evidence of how sport can reproduce and foster a hyper-consumerism culture which is clearly evident in the UK. This culture has significantly grown in the UK over the last two decades and I will look at further into this essay. Although there is evidence of hyper-consumerism having a relationship to sport, there is also evidence of hyper-consumerism being caused by the growth of technology. A prime example of this is the hyper-consumerism of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has seen a growth of hyper-consumerism with the growth of technology within the country\u2019s economy (Kazim, A., 2018). With an abundance of mega malls and the growth of internet shopping the culture in UAE over the last 50 years has transferred from traditional markets to a hyper-consumer culture of luxury global brands. The growth in this culture in the UAE is seen further with the growth of the country\u2019s GDP per capita which, as of 2019, totaled $69,900 (Societe Generale, 2019). This is a stark contrast to 1975 when the GDP per capita was at $26,847 (World Bank, 2019). These statistics suggest a substantial growth in the economy which has come with a growth in consumerism. This suggests the theory that the main cause of hyper-consumerism is the growth of an economy. Further evidence of this is the lack of sport participation in the UAE this hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. Reinforcing that instead of the sports being played fostering hyper-consumerism instead its the growth of globalisation and technology fostering hyper-consumerism. Ultimately, this shows that hyper-consumerism can exist without a large presence of sport within the economy. This hyper-consumerist culture that has been seen in the United Arab Emirates is prominently the whole world over. However, there is clear and specific sport that can be given as evidence for fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. One such sport is basketball and specifically the NBA (National Basketball Association). A prime example within the sport is the Air Jordan brand, owned by Nike and named after the critically acclaimed greatest player of all time, Michael Jordan. The Air Jordan brand, launched in 1984, in 2019, had revenues totalling $3.1 billion which made up 8% of Nike\u2019s revenues in the same year (Forbes, 2020). This along with the revenue of the NBA itself of $8.4 billion shows the massively consumer nature of the NBA in the US (ESPN, 2020). Within the NBA the most popular consumer good is team jerseys, the average price of these is $110, approx. \u00a381 (The Street, 2020). This high priced consumer good along with the cost of attending an NBA game of roughly $89. This fits perfectly the nature of goods that are typical of a hyper-consumerist culture described in the introduction. These goods are not something that is functional but people want and purchase for their lives to fit in with the culture. Hyper-consumerism is caused by a number of economic factors and the sports economic growth is instead down to the existence of hyper-consumerism. An economic factor is globalisation, with the growing number of accessible non-functional goods hyper-consumerism has become a causal byproduct. This can be seen in sports as seen above with the English Premier League growing to revenues of \u00a35.4bn in 2020. With the league being watched globally in 188 of 193 countries (Premier League, 2019). Without globalisation there would not be abundant accessibility of sports to consumers. With the growth of commercial sports media on the internet in places such as Youtube, with 79% of users watching sports on the platform (Youtube, 2020). Globalisation of markets has caused hyper-consumerism and greater accessibility to sports that would not be possible without globalisation. . Previously I have discussed the growing sporting culture and spectator sports in the UK and its role in fostering hyperconsumerism. This is an area that has seen significant growth and can be used as evidence. On the subject of spectator sports, on average in the UK expenditure by spectators is \u00a354 per person (not including ticket price) (Sports England, 2019). This shows sports fostering hyper-consumerism as when attending these events spectators are spending money for non-functional purposes. Furthermore, the UK sporting goods market is expected to have grown by 3.5% in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic (Ibis World, 2020) . Largely caused by the increase of people exercising during the national lockdowns ordered by the UK Government. This being reinforced by the statistics, from Sport England, that 63% of people saying that they exercise over 3 days a week in the first National Lockdown. This shows that even in a time of economic negativity with the UK economy shrinking by 3.4% (PWC, 2020) there was still significant consumer spending on sport showing the level of consumers wants and needs to spend on the non-functional goods or services. This growth in the market even in the pandemic is far greater than other non-functional goods in this time and show the nature of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. Throughout this essay I have compared aspects in which that sport both does foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism but also doesn\u2019t. The aspects that sport shows to foster and reproduce is through the growth of popular leagues such as the English Premier League and these top leagues promoting a lifestyle, the growing of UK household expenditure on watching professional sports, sporting good brands promoted through professional sports such as the NBA and the Air Jordan brand, expenditure on attending spectator sports and purchases at these events. All these aspects promote a clear message that sports play a role in hyper-consumerism at the bare minimum. Whether sport \u2018fosters and reproduces\u2019 hyper-consumerism is highly contestable. Shown by the evidence presented hyper-consumerism can exist and grow without an overarching presence of sport, as seen with the UAE in which the average GDP per capita has grown from $26,847 in 1975 to $69,900 in 2019. This staggering growth in GDP per capita has caused a growth in the consumerist culture which is highly focused on luxury consumer brands. This hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. In conclusion, I think that, firstly, sport can foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism. However, I believe that hyper-consumerism does not need sports to grow as shown with the case of the United Arab Emirates, although this is a rarity and to fully determine how common of an occurrence this can be further research needs to be done. Finally, although sport does foster hyper-consumerism it is only possible with globalisation and instead globalisation is the major foster and reproducer of hyper-consumerism and sports is an area that is consumed by the hyper-consumerist culture we have.", "positive": ", Thank you for your time last week.

{"id": "aug_141", "anchor": "Johns Case: John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010). Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: John\u2019s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John\u2019s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992). Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so. John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017). As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008), who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008). John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood. Coping: John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance. In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). Interventions: The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and has little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007). Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": "Hotels: Hotel Katajanokka- 160 per night, 4.5 stars. south of central helsinki Hilton Helsinki Strand- 174 per night, 4.7 stars, north of first hotel Both have restaurant, the strand has a pool aswell ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cafes: free wifi at both Savy- further north of the strand ,4.5 stars Artisan cafe, 1 road east of Savy 4.7 stars (Can go to both on separate days for a change of scene) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Helsinki city museum - Worlds only museum focussing on Helsinki -Everyday life there and details about spaces and atmosphere in Helsinki -Souvenir shop inside too aswell as a bar -Near both hotels ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Restaurants: (Reserve online available, and dine in available) Restaurant Savoy, 4.6 stars, Finnish food, in between both hotels, expensive.

{"id": "aug_152", "anchor": "Results Data treatment After the data was recorded, the alpha channel was duplicated which made it easier to keep track of the transformations made to the signal (\"EEG Analysis with AcqKnowledge\", 2006). The data was rectified in order to turn the negative values into positive so that the average signal strength (\u00b5V) was shown rather than the range. The data was averaged over 50 samples using Biopac\u2019s \u2018Integrate\u2019 feature which allowed for the graph curves to be smoother and clearer. The rectification and integration of the data was necessary so that an accurate mean could be taken for each condition. These new rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for the rest of the data analysis. Descriptive &amp; inferential statistics Table 1. Table 1 shows that the mean of the eyes open condition was lower than the eyes closed condition. There was not a large amount of variance of data across the means (see Table 1). The eyes open condition had a smaller variance than the eyes closed, as the standard deviation was closer to the mean in this condition. The Chi\u00b2 test suggests that the frequencies of the RAAA are significantly different in the eyes open and closed conditions (Chi\u00b2 = 12.500, df = 1, p &lt; .01). The RAAA frequency was 26 in the eyes closed condition and 6 in the eyes open condition, so the means are consistent with the RAAA frequencies. To summarise, the results show that there is a difference between the RAAA frequencies of the eyes open and eyes closed conditions. These results were expected as brain rhythms differ when eyes are open or closed (Barry et al., 2007). Reflection I have achieved a general understanding of physiological measurement using Biopac from conducting this study, as I have learnt how to use the system to rectify and integrate data in order for it to be more understandable to analyse. As a group, we found the placement of the electrodes using the international 1020 positioning system fairly difficult, as it wasn\u2019t particularly clear where exactly to place them on the scalp. We had to change the positioning of the electrodes and remove the dead skin from the scalp a few times until the impedance was low enough to continue the rest of the experiment. I didn\u2019t enjoy placing the electrodes on the participant\u2019s scalp and measuring the distance between the nasion and the inion because both tasks were meticulous and required a lot of patience. However, I did enjoy using Biopac to rectify the data in order to see clearly the brainwaves of the participant and how it correlated with whether their eyes were open or closed. In order to improve the experiment, I would reduce the number of confounding variables by ensuring the participant wasn\u2019t blinking, talking or chewing during the experiment, as these artifacts may have had an impact on the data used for analysis. Additionally, I would have ensured the experiment took part in a quiet room away from other people as it is more likely for the brainwave activity to be due to whether the participant\u2019s eyes were open or closed rather than distractions.", "positive": "hh snm I'd say do it But just don't deep it Just see what happens innit That's tru But still Do it Bro FIRM ITTT Might aswell get it out the way What's the worst that can happen Also I cleaned the whole yard for you U better be gassed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Not that it deffo needed cleaning lmfaoooo Need to get the red carpet out Bro ok so I rlly wanna go primark now So we going next week idc I'm dragging u \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and the party time banner Need to stop wearing joggers and the same 2 tshirts SAAAAME IVE NOT EVEN STARTED", "positive_attacked": "hh snm I'd say do it But just don't deep it Just see what happens innit That's tru But still Do it Bro FIRM ITTT Might aswell get it out the way What's the worst that can happen Also I cleaned the whole yard for you U better be gassed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Not that it deffo needed cleaning lmfaoooo Need to get the red carpet out Bro ok so I rlly wanna go primark now So we going next week idc I'm dragging u \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and the party time banner Need to stop wearing joggers and the same 2 tshirts SAAAAME IVE NOT EVEN STARTED", "label": 1}

However, I have a block course in for 4 days which is worth 3 credits and was just wondering if I would be penalised if I didn't partake in it? This would mean that I only have 28 credits for this semester and then would go on to take 31 credits next semester. So would end up with a total of 59 credits instead of 60.

So I did a study placement at . I chose to do a study placement as I wanted to improve my language skills and they had a well renowned language programme at the University. The experience was literally one of the best things I've done in my life. I met so many people of different nationalities and made some amazing friends as well as really improving my language skills (written, spoken and in particular Grammar). If you want anymore information let me know. It was really hard to adjust at first and I was really homesick. However, I just tried to integrate myself into all of the student events and talk to as many people as possible. As soon as I made friends then I felt a bit more settled and it took me a while to feel comfortable in using day to day. However, you'd be suprised at how nice people are and they just appreciate trying to speak in so just really go for it. I wish I had been a bit more confident to start with. It's important to say as well that I was going to do a half study, half work placement at first but decided to stick with study as that was what was best for me. But I would highly recommend doing half and half as you get the best of both worlds and also it looks good employability wise. If you feel that you really struggle with grammar etc then I would definitely suggest half a study placement as it will aid you in final year when it comes to dissertation and assessments etc. Yes please message me whenever and I will keep checking in on you as I really understand how difficult this year can be especially in the current climate.

I wanted to ask if the articles regarding the profession chosen could be about anything to do with the profession or if it is specifically about the responsibilities or other factors etc. also it says to select two academic papers do these have to be research papers or can they be any form of academic paper. If you can provide any advice regarding these questions it would be much appreciated Thanks ( ) Undergraduate student", "label": 1}
{"id": "aug_160", "anchor": ", I hope you are well. I just wanted to send a quick follow up email regarding something you said in the webinar a couple of weeks back. It was discussed about giving us some sample answers or parts of previous student's essays (I know you said you wouldn't be releasing whole essays). Would it be possible to find out where I can access these or if you haven't released them could I ask if you will still be doing this, as I feel it would be a big help just to assist us with structuring answers. Many thanks Thank you ! Have a great evening Hi , I am just trying to wtrite up my part of my assignment. Would it be possible for you to explain how I use to access the data I will need E.g. the passport database. I am just struggling a little to find exactly where I should be looking as I haven't dien this before. Many thanks Hi , I hope you are having a good week. Could I confirm if I am supposed to have received a Teams link for our meeting at 1.45pm tomorrow? Many thanks, Hi , I hope you're well. I know we have a meeting tomorrow, but I just wanted to send you a draft of my introduction to check I am on the right lines. If it is okay with you I would like to discuss the structure of the write up during our meeting tomorrow. Many thanks, Hi , I just wanted to quickly confirm something with you. I have almost finished my plan and believe it will come to about 3,500 words with the reflective statement and the plan. Is this too many words as I know usually the limit is plus or minus 10% from the recommended amount of words (3000)? Many thanks Hi , Thank you again for your time today to go through my introduction and my structure for the essay. I just have one final question: would it be possible for you to provide us with a source or some points for the 'criticisms of Trompenaars' as you have done with Hofsted during the lectures?

Also, do you know anything about a grant that the university offers to placement students (approx. \u00a31,000)?

{"id": "aug_177", "anchor": "Both the biological and psychoanalytic approaches seek to explain human behaviour. The biological approach proposes the idea that all psychological problems are rooted in physiological causes, whereas the psychoanalytic approach suggests that behaviour is due to unconscious forces and childhood experiences. The key features of these approaches are distinct from each other and have their uses and limitations, yet, both are still widely used in psychology. The biological approach prevails over other psychological approaches due to the fact that its explanations encompass anatomy, physiology and the role of neurological function. This approach accepts the idea of materialism as it assumes that all behaviour has a physical basis. This opposes the previously accepted idea of dualism, in which it was believed that the body and the mind are separate but interacting entities. The shift from dualism to materialism was supported with work by Paul Broca (1861). In studying a patient called \u2018Tan\u2019, Broca discovered that there was a direct link between the articulation of speech and damage to a particular cortical region. This area was later named \u2018Broca\u2019s area\u2019 and pioneered the idea that particular cognitive functions can be localised to areas in the cerebral cortex (Grodzinsky &amp; Amunts, 2006). Localisation of brain function is a central concept to the biological approach. Broca (1861) and Wernicke\u2019s (1874) findings were some of the first to show that damage to cortical areas produces a change in language. A significant drawback of these findings was that they were concluded from limited post-mortem evidence, which makes it difficult to show the specificity of location. The mechanism of speech may be something that is controlled by multiple areas, so damage to any one of these areas may produce the same effect (Myers, 2007). Recent research by Delgado and Hamlin (1956) demonstrated how stimulation of the motor cortex using electrodes led to specific physical reactions. In one individual the left motor cortex was stimulated, and it was found that the right fist would clench. This provided support for the latter idea that the cerebral cortex is split into four lobes, each relating to a different function (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). Another feature of the biological perspective is the idea of brain communication through the use of neurotransmitters. These chemicals are involved in regulating processes in the body such as emotion. If there is a biochemical imbalance in these systems, this may in turn affect human behaviour. A review by Seo and Patrick (2008) demonstrated how a deficiency in serotonin combined with high levels of dopamine interact together in the prefrontal cortex and may predispose individuals to aggressive behaviour. This follows the diathesis-stress model in stating how irregularities in biological systems may predispose individuals to certain conditions which manifest after being triggered. This shows that contrary to general assumption, the biological approach does not entirely ignore the role of nature in human behaviour. It acknowledges that biology may be just the precursor to abnormal behaviour. Empiricism is an essential component in understanding the functioning behind biological systems. Experiments such as Delgado and Hamlin, (1956) and Seo and Patrick, (2008) show that being deeply embedded in the observational methods of science provides an advantage of the biological approach over others. This level of empiricism means that studies can be easily replicated. Likewise, the possibility of direct manipulation of a variable and the observation of the response means that valid conclusions can be drawn. From this, researchers are then able to take away evidence that helps support concepts such as neurotransmitter effects. As the biological approach follows the law of parsimony, it often finds itself being criticised for being too reductionist. Complex behaviour is simplified down to individual physiological mechanisms. For example, the concept of being able to produce language is reduced to the interactions between neurones in the frontal lobe when the explanation behind this may be far more intricate. This approach is also deterministic as biological processes are exempt from our free will. If aggression is due to neurotransmitter abnormality, this suggests that there is no control over the behaviour exhibited. However, evidence by Van Lier, Vitaro and Eisner (2007) has shown how peer rejection in children can lead to maladaptive behaviours, including aggression. This demonstrates how an environmental rather than a biological factor can lead to an individual choosing to express their aggressive behaviour. An alternative to this is the psychoanalytic approach which was developed by Sigmund Freud in 1896. One of the concepts Freud introduced was that personality development is moulded by childhood experiences and fixations, namely the psychosexual stages of development. He theorised that all children go through the oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stages in which the individual is focused on obtaining pleasure through the specific areas. In each of these stages, there is the possibility for fixation to occur. If this occurs at any stage, personality development into adulthood may be affected (Fennald, 1997). A second concept is that personality is split into the id, ego and superego which are unconscious forces that influence our decisions and motives. The id contains sexual instincts (libido) and aggressive instincts (Eysenck, 1988). The superego reflects the moral standards of society, restricting the id from making decisions which would not be allowed and the ego is the decision maker, mediating between the two (Jarvis, 2000). There is substantial contemporary evidence to suggest that Freud was correct in some of his propositions, like his idea of unconscious cognitive processes. Research by Westen (1999) looks to explain how the activation of particular unconscious associative networks influences ongoing thoughts, feelings and behaviour outside our awareness. Westen theorised that when networks associated with a particular situation are activated, this spreads to other neural networks and increases the likelihood of interpreting a situation in a certain way. This supports Freud\u2019s idea by showing how a previous experience, stored in the unconscious, is able to influence future interactions. The psychoanalytic approach has advantages over the biological approach by taking a multifaceted view and acknowledging both sides of the nature-nurture debate. The role of nature is considered in how innate drives influence our thoughts, and the role of nurture in how childhood experiences elicit behaviour. Consequently, this approach has similarities with the biological in assuming determinism. Behaviour in adult life is affected by the fixation of libido which suggests that we are shaped by irrepressible forces that are exempt from free will. The scientific status of the psychoanalytic approach is called into question on multiple occasions which puts it at a disadvantage to the biological approach. Variables are not manipulated, which makes it difficult to produce causal conclusions, and therefore leads to issues with the falsifiability. Freud\u2019s theories were based upon untested observations in a purely therapeutic situation. Qualitative research derived from case studies are a less reliable source of information and Freud only used 12 over the lifespan of his published work (Eysenck, 2000). However, more contemporary research by Fonagy and Bateman (1999) has shown how the psychoanalytic approach has evolved over time to incorporate more controlled data-gathering methods. In order to test the effectiveness of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalisation as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), Fonagy and Bateman (1999) conducted a randomised control trial and assessed outcome measures such as number of admissions, frequency of suicide attempts and symptom distress. There was a well-structured methodological approach to this study, including the use of DSM-III-R criteria to assess for BPD before participants were randomly assigned to the two groups. This study is an example of how the psychoanalytic approach should not be completely disregarded as non-scientific as current research looks to improve the legitimacy of methods that are used. In conclusion, the biological and the psychoanalytic approach parallel each other in terms of their determinism and their perspective on nature. However, the biological approach has an advantage over the psychoanalytic approach as it is empirical and has a strong scientific basis which supports its credibility. The early concepts of the psychoanalytic approach are difficult to falsify but on the other hand, contemporary psychoanalytic research has since developed to include more rigorous scientific procedures. Despite issues with both approaches, key features have their place in psychology today with localisation of brain function, the action of neurotransmitters and unconscious cognitive processes still being widely accepted.", "positive": "will be fine like you\u2019ve said and doesn\u2019t look so bad in photos or anything so idm just looking after it until I can get it fixed I\u2019ll come to your hairdresser in a few weeks I think x so I think it\u2019ll do for now yeah will see in a few weeks and get it sorted Had a really good time it was so nice to see and The meal was so nice!

I've just had a chat with one of my mentee's who is quite stressed and I just wanted to raise a few concerns regarding placements following my conversation with her. There were a few things that I noted from the conversation including: She felt that she hasn't been given enough sufficient guidance and support from the placements team and correspondence about what placements she should be looking for and when she did try to make an appointment with the placements team, she said that she was told the wrong things. She said that she was told that she could apply for non-international placements so had been looking for placements only based on these criteria to then be told that she must complete an international placement. Furthermore, in the initial appointment she had been told that she would have some placement suggestions to be sent to her which never happened. She said that she feels that she is in the dark about the whole year abroad experienceprocess of application and this has made her really stressed about it. I have told her to make another appointment with the placements team which she has done and to raise all of this in the appointment and how she feels and then to let me know how she gets on. I just felt that it was important for you to know and to also help improve the assistance given by the placements team as this was really worrying to hear as a mentor.

Best wishes, Hello , I received my mark for the presentation assessment over Christmas and I must admit, I was quite disappointed! Apologies for the delay in bringing this up, thought it was best to wait until I was back at university. After looking through the feedback provided I'm left quite confused on how my grade was decided. There seems to be lots of feedback on each slide which would usually be great, but I was under the impression that we were being marked solely on our response to the feedback i.e. critical reflection? Or were we also meant to change the rest of the slides following the presentation? I found the task very difficult as we were given such positive feedback on our presentation, I didn't feel like I had very much to work with for this task! I understand all of your negative points raised about our main slides, but as we did not receive that feedback at the time, I'm unsure of how I was meant to make any changes to that for my submission. Following this, you made comments about me not changing the text-heavy slides for my submission. I understand its a bit of an eye-sore but I saw no other way of getting all the information we spoke about in our presentation onto the limited number of slides. Were we meant to have left them as bullet points without the key info when submitting? Sorry for all of the questions - just hoping to better understand the rationale behind the marking. Many thanks, Hi , Yes this is correct, I have been offered a position with . However, I would like to hold off on the paperwork on the university's side for now if possible. I had a meeting with yesterday and we decided that that was the best course of action for now as I am still waiting to hear back from a number of other places.

Hello, Since receiving the recent TP2 update that there will actually be no changes to teaching after Christmas, I was wondering if there will now be an opportunity to cancel accommodation. When the students were booking accommodation, we were under the impression that after Christmas we would be going back to being in university physically, and therefore we had no obligation to cancel or postpone our payments - due to the recent change, are there going to be any opportunities for this, as it would be preferable not to be paying over \u00a36000 for an unneeded room? Thank you, Hi, I was writing to enquire about possible cancellation of my room due to the new updates with TP2 that there will still be no in person contact on campus. I, as many others, booked accommodation under the idea that there would be a need to be coming in every week, but since the university are having seminars and lectures online, and have confirmed that this won\u2019t change in as they first believed it would, it would be really beneficial to me to be able to not pay for a room I no longer use. Due to the continued increase of cases within , I am currently back at home, therefore the room is not being used but being paid for. I understand that there is a contract, but I would really appreciate any help that could be given within the current circumstances. I understand that no one was to know what would go on, and that is why I booked the room in the first place. Even if the full cancellation isn\u2019t possible yet, would there be any chance that this would be possible in the future? Maybe after Christmas or in the final term as was done at the end of last year?

{"id": "aug_186", "anchor": "Deductive and Inductive reasoning are examples of propositional logic to construct thoughts into a valid argument. Deductive reasoning begins from a general statement that leads to a certain conclusion (Johnson-Laird, 2000; Rips, 1999; Williams, 2000). For example, \u2018all noble gases are stable, helium is a noble gas, so helium is stable.\u2019 Inductive reasoning begins with specific observations which lead to a conclusion that is likely to explain the observation and the conclusion may be used to predict future specific occasions (Johnson-Laird, 2000). An example would be if all children in one day care like Legos, it could be assumed all children like Legos. A similarity between the reasonings are that they are both used to provide a valid argument and are used often. Another similarity is that both reasonings follow premises in which they base their argument on. A difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is that deductive reasoning begins with a hypothesis and tests the hypothesis via an observation whilst inductive reasoning begins with observations and then moves towards a theory. This is because deductive inference is based upon theory whilst inductive inference is based on observations. There is also a difference in validity between the reasonings as deductive reasoning is more precise as if all the premises are true then the conclusion is true for example, \u2018if all dolphins are mammals and all mammals have kidneys, all dolphins therefore have kidneys.\u2019 However, even if the premises are true in induction, the conclusion is still not definitely true. For example, \u2018if the first button I get out of a bag is a red button, the third button I obtain from the bag is red, therefore it is inductive logic to conclude all the buttons in a bag are red.\u2019 Therefore, deduction is more accurate and quantitative whilst induction is more general and qualitative. Due to this, induction is used more in everyday life as it is harder to obtain a sequential set of facts that are known to be true in deduction.", "positive": "o, is there any advice you could give for the assignment question?

{"id": "aug_191", "anchor": "Abstract: This experiment investigates the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) using a cued visual attention task through an electroencephalogram (EEG). The predictions for this study are that alpha activity would be higher for the left parietal lobe in the cue left (Cl) condition rather than cue right (Cr). 39 psychology students performed visual attention task and were cued to expect the stimulus on either the right or left. This study found that the left condition did have higher alpha amplitudes in comparison to the right condition when recording for P3. The findings for this study supported previous research and found that in conclusion the alpha inhibition is indicative of attention. Introduction: \u2018High alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas\u2019 (Kilesch 2007) and is also reduced in task relevant brain areas. The findings of Handel et al (2011) showed that the stimuli presented to the participants visually were processed on the opposite side of the brain to where the stimuli were, and it is contralateral to the unattended side showing significantly higher alpha power. The results show that if a stimulus was to be presented on the left-hand side, it will be processed on the right side of the brain. A study by Sauseng et al (2005) which is being partially replicated by this study, asked participants to conduct a cued visual attention task and focused on different regions of the brain. The participants responded to a stimulus on a screen after being presented with an arrow that was an indication of which side the stimulus would appear on. The results show the side of the brain in which the stimuli had been processed, will obtain less alpha. There was also a significant effect of cue 200ms prior to stimulus onset recording from P3. These studies all show that alpha activity will be higher on the ipsilateral side in which the stimuli is shown, this supports the AIH. Therefore, supporting studies suggest that the hypothesis for this study is that the alpha amplitude would be higher in the Cl than the Cr, when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe. Method: Participants: A total of 39 undergraduate psychology students volunteered to be a participant, they were split into 5 groups. Design: The study was a repeated measures design as each participant saw both Cl and Cr conditions. The independent variable is the direction of the cue consisting of 2 levels whether it was left or right, and the dependant variable is the alpha amplitudes measured in microvolts (\u03bcV). Materials: Data was collected using a Biopac MP360. EEG electrodes were used, and AC cream was applied to help with the conductivity and reduce impedance. Everi cream to reduce skin impedance. PsychoPy is used to provide the stimuli and an event marker is sent to the Biopac. A large and small bar stimulus (figure 1a and 1b) in which participants focus their attention to. And arrow cues letting the participants know which side the stimulus will appear on, symbolised by the keys &lt; and &gt;. Procedure: The Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35 Hz and channels are set up to allow the left and right cue event markers to be accessed through PsychoPy, the event markers were used to identify when the stimuli were presented. Another channel is set up to record activity from the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz), the sampling rate was 1000 Hz; 1000 observations recorded per second. The experimenter explained the objective to the participant and consent was given before proceeding, electrodes were then put into place. Following the \u20181020 system positioning\u2019 the active electrode is placed on the P3 site on the left side of the parietal lobe in the brain. The reference electrode is placed at Fz and the earth electrode is placed by the participants hairline. Impedance checks are then done and were kept below 10KOhms. Instructions were presented on the screen for the participants to follow, stating that a cue will appear indicating which side the stimulus will appear on; left or right. A fixation cross appeared in the centre then followed by a stimulus of a bar either large or small. Participants were then told to press a specific key depending on which bar was presented e.g., \"L\" for large bar and \"S\" for small bar. Practice trials were completed first to allow them to test run the experiment and understand what they are being asked to do. Participants took part in 4 different conditions with 3 repeats so a total of 12 practice trials. Once completed feedback was given to the participants. Similarly, to the practice trial, participants then took part in the real trial containing 20 blocks of 4 trials in which 50% of the trials cued left and 50% cued right all in a randomised order. In total there was 80 experimental trials. The cues were presented on the screen for 35ms. Then followed by a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) this is set for 200ms to 1200ms. An event marker is then sent at the onset of the stimulus and the stimulus was then displayed for 50ms. Participants then proceed to respond. During the study the experimenters explained to the participant what the task was, they put the electrodes in place and proceeds to the impedance test, then the experimenter begins the experiment for the participant to complete. The experimenter recorded the data which was then followed by debriefing the participant about the aims of the study. The experimenter helped to clean up the participant then proceeded to analyse the data that was recorded. Participants had to read the instructions that appeared before starting the experiment and follow these instructions by pressing certain keys and focusing on what appears on the screen. Data treatment: When the experiment is running, event markers were sent to the computer, then to the biopac. This records exactly when the stimuli were presented, this allows the period 200ms before stimulus onset to be analysed for the Cl and Cr condition. The raw alpha data were then rectified regardless of it being either excitatory or inhibitory. This meant that any negative values were converted to positive values and an average deviation from 0\u03bcV was produced. The data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce extreme values. These data then become rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA). Results: Table 1 shows the results for 38 participants as one participant withdrew from the experiment, so no data is provided. A Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to test whether the data was parametric or non-parametric. As the p value was less than .05, a non-parametric test was carried out. The median RAAA indicates that the Cl condition had higher alpha amplitude compared to the CR condition at the P3 site. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T= 566, n= 38, p= .002). Discussion: The findings support the hypothesis that there is greater alpha amplitude when the stimuli are Cl then when the stimuli are Cr. Our results are consistent with the AIH and Sauseng et al as alpha activity is contralateral to the side it is processed, and our results showed there was less alpha activity contralateral to the stimuli where the visual stimuli had been processed. This suggest that the side of the brain that is not involved with attention has less alpha activity. A methodological problem of this study is that attention could have been redirected due to being in a distracting environment in which multiple other students were talking. Evidence from previous research (Garrison &amp; Williams 2013) shows that participants do not perform as well when distracted and are more likely to make common mistakes when taking part in a task. To gain more accurate results these limitations will need to be controlled such as being in an environment with minimal noises, therefore helping the participant to focus better.", "positive": "r Sir or Madam, I am currently a second year student at university and I wish to be doing placement next academic year that will enable me to learn a lot and gain some additional knowledge.

{"id": "aug_193", "anchor": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that captures the obligation of a business to the environment, its stakeholders and the broader society (Blowfield, 2005). Over the years, the concept has evolved from corporate philanthropy (Bowen, 1953) to incorporate broader concerns such as environment and human rights, driven by social rights and legislative change (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). In recent years, CSR has been viewed as a link between business strategy and sustainable development, causing companies to utilise industry standards such as the United Nations Development Goals and Global Compact. This pressure from stakeholders to go beyond the minimal requirements allows companies to address broader goals and objectives, and by doing so, a positive brand image is created (Carroll, 2016). Political influence can be defined as a \"social influence process in which behaviour is strategically designed to maximise short-term or long-term self-interest, which is either consistent with, or at the expense of other\u2019s interests\" (Ferris, Russ and Fandt, 1989). Political CSR is described as activities where \"CSR has an intended or unintended political impact, or where intended or unintended political impacts on CSR exist\". Therefore, political CSR can be used in three ways, which will be analysed further; these include being used as a substitute for non-conventional forms of political activity or directly supporting conventional political activities such as lobbying and constituency building. Additionally, CSR can be used in a novel or innovative way which does not directly correspond to political activity (Frynas and Stephens, 2014). This assignment will evaluate research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political activity, analysing the three ways CSR has been utilised to advance corporations political standing concerning real-life cases. The reasons in which CSR can be strategically used generally concerns initiatives to build corporate brand image or reputation, constituency building, building relationships and even agenda setting whereby donations can reinforce key industry messages to shift perceptions (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). In order to analyse the relationship between CSR and political influence, this report will be focusing heavily on the research surrounding Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and oil and gas companies. However, it must be noted that there is a limitation of the research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political influence, as it primarily focuses on these industries. Industries surrounding public health and the environment has been seen to invest heavily in CSR operations to \"offset\" their negative brand image and gain political support due to operations that are seen as working directly against society\u2019s benefit (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). For-profit corporations have been increasingly promoting that they act as partners with government and communities to address social problems. These partnerships are what Coca-Cola\u2019s former CEO refers to as \"connected capitalism\", in which collaborations help maximise shareholder value (Foster, 2014). In turn, by utilising constituency building, corporations can facilitate access to policy elites and build relationships with them. This relates to a global triangle, an approach to sustainability in which business, government, and civil society join. Coca-Cola\u2019s CEO claims the partnership system Coca-Cola has developed is \"the most beautiful example\" of the golden triangle where each party can come together and make a difference to big societal problems (Radtke, 2013). Although CSR sees an increasingly political role for business firms, corporations are analysed to \"step in\" using \"a global triangle\" to fill governance gaps which they present as governments failing to do so alone. This positioning to take on political responsibilities is seen as a way to present themselves as pursuing public interests whilst pursuing their own political interests whilst building relationships (Eberlein, 2019). CSR as a means of Constituency Building and Facilitating Access to Policy Elites Ha and Hoang (2020) discovered a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and political risk, suggesting that firms are more likely to invest in CSR as an \"insurance mechanism\" against adverse political events. Corporations can utilise CSR to support conventional political activities through constituency-building strategies to establish relationships with key opinion leaders, policymakers, media, and community involvement. In turn, this attempts to influence public policy by gaining the support of voters and citizens, who in turn express their preferences to political decision-makers (Mialon et al., 2016) (Hillman and Hitt, 1999). Although constituency building is a relatively robust strategy, Rehbein and Schuler (2013) argue that it is hard for companies to implement effectively. This is due to the difficulties convincing societal groups to politically participate, showing the support of a corporation. Even if stakeholders were to participate, it is hard to guarantee their effectiveness (Mialon et al., 2016). Neu et al. (1998) discussed that firms expanding their efforts to manage their legitimacy forestalls regulatory activities by the state that might occur without these efforts. Therefore, utilising CSR as a method of constituency building can minimise the political, legislative changes that can broadly impact businesses due to the legitimisation effect. For example, Mialon et al. discovered that Coca-Cola in Australia heavily used constituency building strategies by using CSR to have relationships with health organisations, community groups and policymakers. More specifically, Coca-Cola developed an initiative to encourage physical activity for kids called \"The Happiness Cycle\", partnering with an Australian charity. This was also interpreted as an agenda-settingframing activity as the company promoted the initiative to \"curb obesity\" and emphasised that they wished to be \"part of the solution\" (Mialon et al., 2016). By using their reputation and influence in a region gained by their CSR initiatives, companies such as Coca-Cola can wield power in governmental organisations. This was present in India, where two members of FSSAI (Food Safety Standards Authority India) are affiliated with an organisation funded by Coca-Cola. This organisation has undermined public health policies by networking with nutrition sciences to nudge \"government policy into alignment with the company\u2019s corporate interests\" (Greenhalgh, 2019). By employing CSR through community campaigns, corporations can gain a sense of \"legitimacy\" that forms a sense of trust, increasing the likelihood that constituency building will be effective and increase their political influence. Furthermore, enhancing legitimacy enables corporations to conduct business activities more effectively than firms that do not engage in community CSR activities and may help minimise risks such as shareholder activism, boycotts of products and negative media coverage (Mirvis, Googins and Rochlin, 2007). However, Mialon et al.\u2019s research surrounding the food industry's corporate political activity can be criticised because it could only incorporate publicly available information. This means that the research is unlikely to give a complete picture of the practices adopted by the food industry, as there is a lack of public documentation surrounding political activity, such as lobbying policymakers and private interactions. Therefore, this questions the validity of their findings, and the specific details of how CSR industry practices influence political activity needs to have further investigation. Exploiting CSR politically to work with other influential groups creates the perception that the message a corporation wishes to convey is balanced and credible, adding to the benefits of using CSR as a means of constituency building (Friedman et al., 1994). Using statistical analysis, Navarro (1998) concluded that although a company\u2019s philanthropic activities can enhance brand image, increasing the effectiveness of lobbying activities, there was no direct relationship found between CSR activities and policy outcomes. As suggested previously, only firms working against public welfare will be using CSR to gain political influence, such as those within public health and energy industries. Therefore, as Navarro\u2019s study incorporated a range of firms from different industries, it was unlikely to find a correlation between CSR and political outcomes. CSR can be strategically utilised to meet stakeholder needs and improve a company\u2019s competitiveness and profitability (Porter and Kramer, 2006). CSR can be used to gain a positive brand image to attract more customers with the increasing demand from stakeholders for companies to adopt socially responsible practices to create a more sustainable and equitable world. Not all CSR initiatives are used to gain political influence, but the benefits of a positive brand image indirectly can help firms gain political power through Constituency and Relationship Building. CSR as a means of Agenda Setting As mentioned previously, CSR is also used as an Agenda Setting method to produce political effects. Fooks discovered a close connection between agenda-setting and constituency building where donations were allocated by BAT to groups \"based on their potential to shape policy agenda through their influence on government thinking and news reporting\" (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of death, illness and impoverishment, killing more than 8 million people each year (WHO, 2020). However, despite this significant public health crisis, tobacco companies and other unhealthy commodities utilise CSR as a PR initiative to create the illusion that they are a \"changed\" company and operate with health interests (WHO, 2009). Research by Fooks et al. analyses that Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco (BAT) engages in CSR primarily due to the potential to promote policy outcomes that work against public welfare. Specifically to prevent the introduction of effective government regulation, which has a record of effectiveness in reducing tobacco consumption (Fooks et al., 2012). Utilising CSR as an Agenda Setting method has allowed BAT to make donations towards reinforcing industry messages designed to alter the discussion of tobacco control away from public health and more towards the economic impacts and employment opportunities the industry gives. Agenda setting aims to manipulate public awareness surrounding issues prevalent in an industry that directly correlates to Coca-Cola. Hamilton (2015) discovered that Coca-Cola\u2019s press releases surrounding CSR have a language that exhibits a paternalistic mentality with words like \"serve,\" \"help,\" and \"provide\". This paternalistic activism contends that outsiders are not best equipped to solve social and environmental issues, therefore boosting the image of their importance. The corporation exhibits a \"power-over\" approach that analysed as robbing communities of the \"decision-making process that affect their lives\" (Ledwith and Springett, 2010). It is hard for the general population to gain back their political influence from corporations acting in a CSR positive way when considering the substantial disparity between communities and Coca-Cola\u2019s access to resources, political decision-makers, and media outlets (Hamilton, 2015). Additionally, in Georgia, USA, the Coca-Cola foundation pledged $3.8m to tackle obesity with the public health agency, the CDC (Radtke, 2013). The Times reported that the money given to the CDC contributed towards a strategy of funding scientists \"who encouraged the public to focus on exercise and worry less about how calories contribute to obesity\" (Kaplan, 2017). Utilising this charitable CSR initiative can take the narrative away from their unhealthy sugar-filled drinks contributing to obesity. By presenting themselves alongside their CSR projects using paternalistic vocabulary to the media, Coca Cola can shape the public agenda and shift perceptions of the underlying adverse effects of their operations and impact on public health. G\u00f3mez (2019) found that three primary factors can limit Coca-Cola\u2019s agenda-setting influence, which is likely to impact other corporations. First, the ability of industry lobbyists to meet with legislative members; second, the pre-existing ties a government has with a corporation and the interests they have in benefiting from the companies\u2019 operations and finally; the corporation supported researchers and activist\u2019s vs the public health advocates, which are divided on opinions. All three of these limiting factors can have risk reduced by CSR initiatives surrounding constituency building, building relationships, agenda-setting and improving brand image. CSR as a means to support lobbying activities Regarding lobbying to change the narrative, it is a practice whereby a company or organisation aims to influence government leaders to create legislation that will benefit their industry somehow. The oil and gas industry has been reported as the 6th highest lobbying spender in the United States in 2020 (Duffin, 2021). It is common practice for oil and gas companies to engage in \"greenwashing\" to appear more environmentally responsible (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). Nasiritousi (2017) wrote about oil and gas companies and how their input and attendance at climate change conventions is controversial as one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. However, they portray themselves as lobbyists against climate change and fund organisations which discredit climate science. These corporations spend countless amounts of money to change the narrative, such as campaigns that convince consumers that their lifestyles must change, as also seen with Coca Cola previously. Campaigns promote that humans are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases- prevaricating the possibility that they are the largest polluters. Showing that they are \"reactive\" to these issues and rebranding themselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis helps to minimise the chances of a significant policy change being implemented that will further impact their business (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). The oil and gas industry can be analysed using Goffman\u2019s (1959) self-presentation theory whereby activities are analysed by a \"front-stage\" of how companies present themselves sustainably and the \"back-stage\" which relates to their corporate political activities. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) bill has been a considerable controversy for the oil industry. It was designed to allow oil investigations to occur in sensitive environmental areas (Cho et al., 2016). Environmentalists and Indigenous communities disputed the ANWR bill due to the irreparable impact oil companies would have on their land. Cho et al. (2016) analysed how oil firms sustainability and CSR practices pressed on the importance of environmental care, ensuring that their CSR practices were visible. However, they kept their proactive political actions targeted towards their interests of passing the bill \"back-stage\". This is a form of impression management whereby firms push CSR practices to an audience to be perceived favourably, and these elements are what the firms are getting more attention for. This method of emphasising positives and underplaying the negatives of their intentions is a common component of sustainability reports whereby corporations will seek to demonstrate how their activities are aligned with social expectations (Goffman 1959; Collinson 1999; Cho et al., 2016). Corporate Reputation and Image In addition, Chen et al. (2007) discuss how US companies with worse product and safety infringements were more likely to give to charity than those with better records. They analyse how CSR can be used as a \"distracting technique\" which is an innovative method of gaining political influence without directly operating politically. Their findings suggest that corporate philanthropy is used more for legitimisation than a measure of CSR performance. Companies can legitimise operations by utilising creative philanthropic activities by rebranding their image to reshape public imagination or ideology (Chen et al., 2007). For example, trans-national corporations (TNC) are known for exploiting the environment in emerging market economies more commonly than developed economies. This is because TNC\u2019s are likely to utilise the cheap labour and abundance of resources available in emerging market economies and exploit these for profit-maximisation purposes (Khanna, Palepu and Sinha, 2005). In order to minimise political changes such as increased taxes, emission permits and caps on natural resource use, companies can employ CSR initiatives to regions to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure and social programmes, presenting themselves as a positive contributor to the region (Hohnen and Potts, 2007) In 2000, Coca-Cola established a plant in Kerala, India, where their bottling plant drew around 510,000 litres of water from open wells and boreholes. Non-governmental organisations (NGO\u2019s) discovered that water table levels have decreased from 12m to 35m below the groundwater level. Local women and children had to walk nearly 5km twice a day to fetch water, although it was often unsuitable for drinking and bathing as the water burned their eyes and led to numerous skin conditions (Raj and Shaji, 2017). Additionally, harvest dropped by 40% due to the lack of irrigation, and Coca-Cola allowed toxic wastewater to flow into farmers\u2019 fields near the bottling plants (Foy and Senker, 2012). Coca Cola has been documented to have numerous unethical violations worldwide, such as human rights violations in Columbia and environmental violations in India. However, The Coca-Cola Foundation has donated over $1 billion in contributions to enhance local communities\u2019 sustainability, focusing on areas such as water conservation and recycling, economic empowerment for women, providing education, youth development, and other community and civic initiatives (Coca-Cola, n.d.). These donations are vital to governments that do not have the financial means to provide these services themselves, therefore relying on TNC\u2019s heavily, which increases the power corporations hold in these regions (Willem te Velde, 2002). By positioning themselves as intensely involved in water conservation and community products, unethical behaviour is more likely to be overlooked, and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So, by engaging in CSR practices, incorporating business initiatives that benefit society, Coca Cola can uphold its positive image as a family-focused brand whilst minimising chances of political penalties on operations. Although the theory of using CSR as a method of distraction which Chen et al. (2007) discusses, was a strongly developed argument that companies with worse environmental and product safety history were more likely to give to charity than those with better operational history had some limitations to consider. The research focused on the pattern of charitable donations as purely a distraction technique, ignoring the discussion on the other reasons and effects of the patterns of charitable giving such as political CSR. Despite this, the research mentioned above shows a pattern of CSR encouraging bad behaviour to more likely be overlooked and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So even though CSR can be used as a distracting technique per se, the charitable contributions produce a legitimisation effect, which can help with political activities such as lobbying, access to policy elites, and constituency building due to the increased positive brand image. Final Analysis to Conclude It is without a doubt that there is a strong relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence from the research provided above. However, as expressed previously, different industries are likely to use political CSR in vastly alternative ways, leading this topic to be challenging to analyse. Most research surrounds public health and environmental corporations that produce negative externalities to society. Therefore, even though the research utilised shows the strengths in the relationship, it cannot be entirely reliable and applied to all industries. The research provided in this paper suggests that there is a relationship whereby CSR is used as an insurance mechanism against political risks, insinuating that corporations are likely to increase CSR activities when the political environment is uncertain. Without a doubt, industries working against the public\u2019s welfare have benefitted from using CSR as a means to gain political influence, as seen with the oil and gas industries \"greenwashing\" activities, Coca-Cola\u2019s constituency building and BAT\u2019s donations to shape policy agenda. Additionally, improving brand image has been seen to help corporations legitimise operations to shape the views of the public and policy setters by forming a sense of trust. In order to identify the true relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence, it would be necessary to expand research in a broader range of industries. The available research displays a pattern between increasing CSR practises when operational activities are not in the public interests. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong relationship between CSR and political activities, at least in the industries concerning public health and energy, or involving questionable product safety. If this were applied to industries that do not primarily work against public welfare, there would be a weaker relationship between CSR and political influence.", "positive": ", Very sorry, I joined the webinar but my computer has died because of a power cut :( hopefully I\u2019ll be able to join again soon but I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll miss the break out rooms?

Many thanks, Hi , Many thanks for your help and your reply. Enjoy the rest of your week, Dear , If i leave my modules for now but then decided to just swap one after the deadline do you think this would be a major issue? If it was say just swapping one module from a tp1 to a tp2 module? Many thanks Dear , Thank you for getting back to me and I hope you enjoyed your break. did indeed respond to my email thank you. However, I do have one final question having just selected my modules as shown below. There are a lot of modules in P1, will they balance this out because I'm not sure doing 67 modules in one teaching period would be very manageable? I have placed also in Cc as she also had a similar concern about the module imbalances. Many thanks in advance for your reply, Hi , I really hope you can help me. Would it be possible to change one of my module selections from a first term module to second? (E.g to ). I am just becoming so overwhelmed having to do 7 modules in one term. I have already had a couple of breakdowns over the workload and am finding that I haven't had any time this week to take a break to switch off from my work. I also feel that I will be working all weekend every weekend if I continue with the 7 and I feel this could become even more stressful and too much to cope with \ud83d\ude41 I would like to take the decision sooner rather than later so that I am also not messing the university and module leaders about.

{"id": "aug_201", "anchor": "Alpha waves are brain waves which are active during ones resting period. The alpha inhibition hypothesis states that \"high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas\" (Klimesch et el. 2007) therefore when paying attention to a certain stimuli alpha will reduce in task relevant brain areas as it can be modulated by attention. This experiment will be a slight replication of Sauseng at al\u2019s (2005) study stating, \"A shift of visually spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\". Whereby he found high alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield from -200ms to 600ms. Which means that, because we process information on the opposite hemisphere from where a stimulus is attended, alpha amplitude is higher in that opposite region at -200ms. Although Seusgen looked at 5 regions of interest within the brain with 4 experimental conditions, we will place our electrode at P3; left hand side of the parietal lobe, this is because Sauseng et al. (2005) found that parietal sides were good indicators of alpha in relation to attention. We will also, only look at 2 conditions (left and right valid). The hypothesis for this study is \"\"Measuring from P3, there will be greater alpha amplitude on the left cue condition compared to the right cue condition\". Which is consistent with previous studies that have been done on this such as Sauseng et al, (2005) and Mazahari et al. (2014). Therefore, based on which side the cue is presented, will affect how much alpha amplitude is present on the contralateral side of the brain. Method: Participants: This study consisted of 38 undergraduate students who volunteered to take part. After one being removed due to only having data for one condition. Design: The design of this study was repeated measures whereby each person went through 2 conditions. The independent variables for this study were the levels of state they were in which include the left and the right cue which were both valid. The dependent variable was the units the data was measured in which were microvolts. Materials: Materials used for this experiment include a Biopac MP36 to collect the data, EEG electrodes, AC cream, Everi cream, Psychopy to send event markers to Biopac through a Slimtracker device and the large and small bar stimuli that was used for the actual experiment. Procedure: To carry out this experiment out, consent was taken from participants. Following on to Biopac, it was started by selecting \u2018EEG\u2019 from the analogue section and then, the channels being set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. This was done so that that event markers could be received from Psychopy and the Slimtracker. D6 received event markers on channel EC0 and D7 received them on EC1. Which continued onto, setting up a calculation channel that recorded activity in the alpha frequency range (8-13Hz) whereby the sampling rate was 1000Hz. After setting up the Biopac and computer systems, it was time to prepare the participant from whom the data was going to be recorded. To do so, electrode sites were abraded with Everi cream and white AC cream was put onto the electrode to get rid of any dead skin cells. Once the electrodes were all ready to set up, they were attached onto the scalp, making sure all the hair was moved out of the way to get much accurate results. As electrodes were applied following the 1020 system, the active electrode was attached on P3, reference electrode was attached to the Fz region and the earth electrode was attached on the forehead, near the hairline, to improve conductivity and reduce the need for abrasion. Next, is the impendence check, to check how much resistant there is to electric flow throughout the scalp, which should below 10Kohms. Once everything is at level, the experiment starts whereby the cue is present for 34ms followed by a 600-800ms random interstimulus interval. The small and large bars appear for 50ms whereby the participants had to press \u2018s\u2019 if they see a small bar and a \u2018l\u2019 if they see a large bar. Participant were given 12 practice trials and 80 experiment trials for validity. To complete this experiment, participants were debriefed from the experiment. Results: Data treatment: In order to get from the raw 9-13Hz Alpha EEG to the averaged data, event markets were used to send from psychopy to identify when stimuli were presented. During this, the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown was looked at. Then the raw alpha data was rectified to show alpha activity regardless of if it was excitatory or inhibitory. The over sampled were averaged to reduce the impact of extreme values. Data was then given a name. Table 1 shows that the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed rank test showed this difference was significant (T=566, n= 38, p= .002). The results support the hypothesis as there was more alpha in the left side of the brain when the cue was present on the right. A t-test and the standard deviations were not calculated for this experiment due to the data being normally distributed. Similarly, due to data not being normally distributed, the mean was not used at it would be distorted by the skew of the distribution. Discussion Results for this study, supported the hypothesis as they show high alpha amplitudes on the left cue, as stated in the hypothesis. These results not only support my hypothesis but are also consistent with Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) and the most recent study done by Mazahari et al. (2014), making it reliable. However, factors such as distractions in the environment could have influenced validity as attention could have diverted elsewhere as eyes were open. Similarly, variables such as chewing gum, swallowing and other mouth movements could have had a negative impact on the results.", "positive": ", I hope you are back in office safely, today.

{"id": "aug_203", "anchor": "Hi Ms (name), After reviewing the local area in Helsinki, I have planned an itinerary for you to view. Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging \u00c2\u00a3163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros.

{"id": "aug_205", "anchor": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs \u00a3157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a caf\u00e9. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a caf\u00e9 to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Caf\u00e9 Kluuvikatu 3, caf\u00e9 which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too. Furthermore, i found a live music bar for my CEO to visit, called Storyville, Helsinki. this offers food, alongside live music band, piano room and dance floor which seems very entertaining.", "positive": "guy might have them First I said my books are irrelevant lol and then he replied they probs are so he\u2019ll think about it xxx seminar took 10 minutes to do But what the hell is a fixture?

Unfortunately, due to family problems and other personal circumstances, I am in a situation where I will be moving out without the support of my family and I will be on my own. I am currently in the process of applying for a maintenance loan to support me additionally. My father died when I was young, so I was only in contact with my mother. However, in my mother kicked me out of the house and culturally I have been \"disowned\" by my family. I have been since living temporarily at a relative' house. However, they do not want me to do life with them because of family issues. I am capable to move out and I am looking at student accommodation. I am currently employed part-time and will be when I intend to move into accommodation but the only difficulty I am facing is; every suitable agency requires me to provide a guarantor but this is a problem because I have no one that will allow me to put them down as my guarantor.

{"id": "aug_221", "anchor": "Middle managers have four main roles within an organization that they are tasked with in order to bring the firm success. Good middle managers should be sense makers of strategy and so explain and simplify what the strategic goals of the firm are, adaptors of strategy and so react to changes in the industry environment. They should also be local leaders meaning that they lead and direct those on lower levels to them while also being champions of strategic issues, going around the firm resolving and communicating the relevant issues to top management. A critical role of middle managers in strategy is sense making, as detailed in a report by Burgelman (1983) they shape the strategy of internal development and give form to the directives given from above, the Top Managers. Middle managers are the ones most directly involved with the people, products &amp; diversified groups and are therefore the impetus with which the strategy of an organisation can be implemented and developed, giving them great importance and relevance. Middle managers are also implementors of strategy, one that has been developed and created by top managers, they allow for the testing of the possible flaws and failings of what has been handed down to them. Subsequently it is the middle managers again that have the responsibility and need to synthesize the information they receive while disseminating it to the top as well as operating level managers in order to facilitate the flow of information in the firm (Kuratko, 2005). This highlights the importance of middle level managers in the firm as they are in the perfect position to keep information going both ways and are able to connect top management to the lower levels of the firm which are normally very disconnected. As a result, at often times middle managers will need to \u2018sell\u2019 key issues to top management, persuading them to commit to resolving certain strategic issues they deem necessary to address. If middle level managers cannot attract the attention of senior management to fix and improve strategy this could lead to the ultimate demise of the company as a whole. The eventual downfall of the mobile giant Nokia can in part be attributed to the failings of the middle managers, and the obstacles put in their way that prohibited them from completing their role as communicators and implementors of strategy. The middle managers were technological experts, the managers and their teams had a deep understanding of Symbian, the software Nokia used, it\u2019s faults and flaws. This best placed them to give advice on what was and what wasn\u2019t working, however the Nokia case study provides a perfect example of when communication isn\u2019t open and positive and the aftereffects. Due to the atmosphere of fear and lack of openness, most middle managers were hesitant to mention their true feelings and communicate the problems to the top (Vuori &amp; Huy, 2016). This meant that the middle managers weren\u2019t able to fulfil their roles, and Nokia\u2019s fall illustrated that without them the business could not function cohesively as a unit. One of the evident issues within Nokia was that there was a great lack of trust from the Top management to the lower levels, and this trust needed to be tangible for middle managers to keep an open dialogue with senior management. In order for information to flow from the lower levels to the upper levels of an organisation trust and a sense of ontological security is necessary, middle managers need to feel like they can openly disclose failures and mistakes with top management, however this wasn\u2019t the case in Nokia. In addition, this trust was to be harboured by top management and it was their responsibility to reduce the fear that failure would lead to punishment (Mantere, S. 2008), instead instigating and encouraging a culture of openness with a sense of security. This culture of fear of failure was not something that could be amended by middle managers but needed action from top management. Since the early 1990\u2019s this high-pressured culture was reinforced with social and economic sanctions, which, as time moved on, further demotivated middle managers to present the real problems that were occurring within the organisation, leading to skewed information flows between the lower and higher levels. The literature indicates that the motivation to sell issues to top management is based on the organisational context of the firm, the theory of Issue-selling intention as explained by Yan Ling et al. (2005) clearly highlights the underlying issues within Nokia\u2019s management. The theory details three contextual cues that motivate middle managers to sell issues to top management: Perceived organisational support, top management\u2019s open mindedness and relationship quality. Albeit none of these were present in Nokia. The first factor, perceived organisational support, is when employees feel safe selling issues to senior management either formally or informally. However, some at the top in Nokia were described as \u2018extremely temperamental\u2019 and seen at often times as intimidating, threatening to fire those that made mistakes, creating a hostile environment in the firm disincentivizing middle managers to sell issues. This exacerbated the other contextual cue of relationship quality, given the perceived aggression from top management the relationship between the different levels could not be trusting nor friendly and resultantly gave middle managers no reason to say things that the top would not want to hear. This would not lead to imminent problems, as seen by Nokia\u2019s continued growth during this period, although it did lead to a sense of conformity overtime disallowing middle managers to have a positive impact on Nokia\u2019s strategic decision making. The theory of Issue-selling intention clearly defines that it should be top management facilitating an ease of communication and instigating a sense of security with bringing forward problems present in the firm. The key underlying issue was the oppressive and domineering culture present at Nokia which created a chasm between top and middle level management. Given that this culture had been present for more than a decade top management should have taken action, slowly opening more channels of communication between the middle and top levels while assuring support for those that did come forward. To anyone working for Nokia it was clear that what top management said could not be refuted, being critical was not a part of the corporate culture and there were fierce repercussions threatened for those that spoke out of line. Within this context, middle managers needed to thread the needle and influence strategic direction in a way that wouldn\u2019t cause friction with top management. One of these ways could have been issue bundling, where the middle managers would try to tie their issues with already agreed-upon goals so as to highlight the importance of their issue to top management in a way that could not be overlooked (Dutton et al., 2001). Middle management could for example try tying their issues to valued goals such as profitability and in this way increase the likelihood of having their issue addressed. This would have been a potent way for middle managers to get senior management to take action on issues that were very evident but not brought up for fear of being reprimanded. In addition to this bundling of issues, another way in which middle level management could influence strategy and implement change would be through the collaboration and wider involvement of employees in selling the issues. Communication did not flow upwards within Nokia, but it did flow horizontally within those at the same level and middle level managers discussed openly the choices they made and reports they gave top management. As a result of collaboration with likeminded individuals, the middle managers would be able to win internal allies and accumulate internal influence (Wickert, C. et al., 2018). In turn managers would feel more empowered and confident to critique the top management\u2019s instructions, which overtime would change the corporate culture and create a more open dialogue within the business. Therefore, middle level managers could have brought their issues to the top easier if they turned to each other for support as they knew of the problems plaguing the business but were too intimidated to bring them forward. On the contrary, whatever change to come about would take time to implement, as shown on the theory of \u2018The transition curve\u2019. The first two phases of this theory capture the difficulty of individuals letting go of the past and coming to terms with the need for change (Balogun et al., 2016). As depicted on the theory, it would take a lot of courage to go against the corporate culture and begin to criticise top management knowing the risks that this would entail and would then lead to lower self-confidence of the managers. A caveat however would be that this theory solely focuses on the individual, and forgets the effect of the collective, which in this case would be great given the change undertaken to influence strategy would be done by all the middle managers, cohesively. The Nokia case study illustrates the rise and fall of a global market leader and highlights the difficulties of maintaining success in the face of an ever-changing external environment. Firms need to be able to move with the times so as to not be left behind. If there are parts of the firm, especially core competencies, that aren\u2019t working as well as they once did then the firm needs to put it behind them and move on. Incumbents are often \u2018overthrown\u2019 when they cannot recognise the threat posed by disruptive innovation and instead continue with the converse of sustaining innovation (Schmidt, G.M., 2008). This was most certainly the case with Nokia, it had invested so much in its own software Symbian that there could be no doubts about its longevity and top management continually asked to incrementally update and change it. This was a key mistake, however, as not only was the software old fashioned as compared to the newer and improved IOS systems, but it was also very difficult to work with. The fact that Nokia tried to force Symbian to work for so long is in part what led it to its eventual demise. Instead, the firm should have cut out Symbian as soon as it stopped producing results and moved on with radical OS innovation that the firm so sorely needed in order to face the increasing competition. This in turn would have reduced pressure on the software organisation and given them the time necessary to produce a quality product instead of rushing results just to meet deadlines. Overtime this lack of transformational change will cause a business to become less and less in touch with the ever-changing demands of consumers. The phenomenon of Strategic Drift will resultantly occur when a firm becomes less in line with the environment within which the organization operates (Johnson, G., 1992), this was the case with Nokia and can lead to a firms eventual demise. Incumbent firms use incremental change, continuing with the practices that have made them so successful in the past, until the reach a flux. At this point managers are unsure of what to do as they have fallen so far behind market trends and resultantly if they do not start transformational change then they may die. This theory can be useful for incumbent firms to recognise the faults that they can make but should be wary that the theory is not as simple as it seems. As in the Nokia case, it took a few years before the firm really started seeing the negative results from not adapting to the times and as a result the theory may be seen as too simplistic in truly addressing the heart of the issue. A final key point that incumbent firms could learn from Nokia is that they cannot become arrogant and must keep managers humble so as to mitigate the overestimation of one\u2019s capabilities. There was a lack of concern from the top, consistent within the middle levels of management that the iPhone was no threat to them. This sentiment arose from the feelings that the firm was invincible due to its market leadership and R&amp;D strength where it had invested over $50 billion over two decades. The overzealousness of the managers would lead to an incorrect assessment of the threat of competition, and lead to an eventual decline of the firm. Incumbent firms should take this example and remain sober minded with regards to competition and learn from Nokia the effects that disruptive innovation can have.", "positive": "lo , My name is , and it is really exciting to have been allocated as your mentee.

{"id": "aug_224", "anchor": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that is widely identified as having impairments on communication and behaviour. The DSM-V refers to social-emotional reciprocity deficits, difficulties in maintaining relationships and deficits in non-verbal communication as diagnostic criteria for Autism (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Memory functions are another aspect of autism that are talked about frequently, in particular, with executive functions (EF). Studies have shown that autistic individuals (AI) struggle with EF. For example, Bennetto et al. (1996) compared AI to individuals that suffer from frontal lobe brain lesions (extensively known for memory impairments) and found that they scored similarly on standardised EF tasks, showing an impairment on their executive functioning. It is important to note that this study was conducted with high-functioning AI so may not speak for all on the spectrum, nevertheless it has been a prominent study in the field of memory and AI. Regarding gathering evidence from autistic witnesses (AW), a few studies have looked at their performance on line-ups, but a lot of the research has focused on formal interviews. The Cognitive interview (CI) is an interview method that significantly improves the detail and accuracy of witness reports across various witness groups and is used highly in the US and UK (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). However, research by Maras and Bowler (2010) found that when conducting the CI on AI, they were less accurate on all sections of the CI compared to the control of typically developing (TD) matched adults. Further study results also suggest that it isn\u2019t an efficient method of interviewing AW, therefore I will list out a few recommendations that may improve evidence gathering from AW in an interview setting. One key aspect in conducting the CI or other enhanced interviews is the \u2018context reinstatement\u2019. Fisher and Geiselman (1992) stated that context reinstatement requires witnesses to mentally return to the incidentcrime for access to the cues that are representative of the incident context. However, for AW and AI this does not seem boost accuracy or recall but in fact reduce their accuracy and lead to reporting more incorrect details (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). One explanation for this is that AI struggle with episodic memory and the relational binding of events. Bowler et al. (2014) presented this as they conducted a study with autistic participants and TD participants where they viewed coloured drawings in a grid. In one condition, they were asked to recall either the item, colour, or location of the drawing and in the other condition, they were asked to recall the item and colour or the item and location. Results showed that participants with autism did significantly worse in the second condition on both trials. The findings suggest that AI show diminished relational binding compared to TD individuals. However, Solomon et al. (2016) suggested it may not be a relational binding problem but rather the excess use of cognitive functions. Solomon\u2019s study into memory involved autistic adolescents compared to Bowler\u2019s adults which could suggest age-specific differences regarding relational binding. Maras et al (2014) argued that the self-administered interview (SAI) combated the caveats for context reinstatement and the social aspect of the CI. The SAI was developed by Gabbert et al. (2009) to initially preserve the memory of the incidentcrime soon after it occurs. Maras et al. used the SAI with AW and despite the perceived benefits, it did not increase the rate of correct details recalled. However, one aspect of the SAI that they found to be useful was the Sketch component as autistic participants found it easier to recall more details with drawing in relation to the event. Maras et al. suggested that this aspect of the SAI may reduce the cognitive demands on AI. To further support this, Mattison et al. (2015) conducted studies with the sketch reinstatement of context (Sketch-RC) and mental context reinstatement (MCR) on autistic children and TD children and found that autistic children in the Sketch-RC condition (which consisted of drawing everything they could remember from the earlier video they watched) did significantly better than the autistic children in the MRC condition. In this study by Mattison et al. the results only supported free recall so a further study (Mattison et al., 2018) assessed the same conditions also in a probed setting (cued recall) but found that autistic children still did not have higher accuracy or detail but they did make significantly fewer errors than autistic children in the MRC condition. Therefore, to aid AI and AW in investigative interviews, the results from these studies suggest that it may be worth adding a sketch element to interviews, especially with children, as though it may not make the largest difference in detailed recall, it can reduce the amount of errors made, leading to better information gathered for the police. One recent recommendation that is also based off improving the recall of AW is the Witness-aimed First Account (WAFA). The WAFA (Maras et al., 2020) is another method of alternate interviewing where AW self-direct their recall. They stated that while Sketch-RC and the CI use unbounded narrative recall, the WAFA uses segmentation.. During the WAFA study, both autistic and TD participants watched an intact narrative version and narratively scrambled version of a crime video in a WAFA and control interview condition. WAFA condition participants were asked to segment aspects of their recall through questions such as, what the most important part of the video was, or what else had happened. The interviewer then returned to the noted segments and asked the participant to recall what had happened for each segment mentioned, in the same order they mentioned them in. Maras et al. found that autistic participants recalled around 15% more correct information as well as TD participants compared to the control condition. However, autistic participants still recalled less than TD participants with the WAFA which leads to more uncertainty of why AW still can\u2019t do as well as TD individuals. Also, in the present study, the time between watching the two videos and conducting the interview was 30 minutes which is unrealistic in a real-life setting. A longer wait may reduce the \u2018effects\u2019 of the WAFA, as memory worsens over time or it could also surprisingly prove beneficial. Nevertheless, there is supporting evidence for the segmentation method that the WAFA uses. Zacks and Swallow (2007) talked about segmentation and suggest that the way in which individuals segment events can aid to remembering more and learning better, especially if their events have boundaries. Interestingly, a study into AI and perceiving actions by Zalla et al. (2013) found that among individuals that had to detect boundary transitions in events at \u2018fine and coarse\u2019 levels, autistic participants showed reduced accuracy compared to TD participants. These findings support the notion that AI struggle with detecting event boundaries in a traditional sense, which makes it more difficult to provide detail and accuracy in standard or CI. The WAFA appears as a good recommendation as though it requires further research (one of the first studies), it uses framework like Zacks et al. to try and use segmentation for aiding better recall in AI. A further component mentioned earlier, is the social aspect of interviews with AW. Again, it is explicit knowledge that AI have many social communicative deficits (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and one qualitative study conducted by Benford and Standen (2009) looked into how high-functioning AI and individuals with Asperger\u2019s preferred internet communication (IC). Participants in the study spoke about the idea of control with IC, such as control over time and how much time they spent on thinking. One participant mentioned that IC allowed her to not have to deal with the \u2018incomprehension and frustration\u2019 of a social encounter. The study does specifically involve high-functioning AI which again, may not be applicable to a wider autistic population, however the study acquired a large amount of detailed information as participants sent from 22-82 email postings back and the researchers were able to spend a while developing their conclusions. Although this study doesn\u2019t directly relate to witness interviews, the premises of it and other research into remote interviewing (see Nash et al., 2014) suggest that the use of technology in gathering evidence may add an element of comfortability for interviews, which can strengthen rapport and lead to a better investigation as a whole. This is shown as Collins et al. (2002) found among conditions of \u2018rapport\u2019, \u2018neutral\u2019 and \u2018abrupt\u2019 interviews, participants recalled more correct information in the \u2018rapport\u2019 condition without an increase of incorrect information but were also more willing to co-operate and \u2018try harder\u2019 for the interview. One very important factor in these recommendations is that individually, they may not seem to produce extremely yielding results but with more research, it can become clearer which aspects provide better information (such as the sketch aspect in the SAI) or even whether some techniques will work cohesively or not. To conclude, the first two recommendations aim to improve the recall provided by AW and both draw on the Task Hypothesis (Bowler et al., 2004) which suggests that AI have better recall when they are provided with more support on what they want to remember. However, autism is a spectrum disorder, indicating that individuals can be extremely diverse, much research into autism even shows the difference as majority of it looks in to high-functioning AI. Even so, the studies allow for base recommendations that can improve with more research. The last recommendation of using technology to better conduct interviews also requires more research in the field but can no doubt offer a more suitable approach for AW that struggle with the social component of interviews.", "positive": "s kind of explains the withdrawals But not the stopping Maybe?

{"id": "aug_234", "anchor": "An unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for chronic health problems, such as obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that personality traits may make an individual more susceptible to unhealthy eating habits. A personality trait reflects a person\u2019s characteristic pattern of thinking, feeling and behaving (Soto, 2018). According to the Five Factor Model of personality, there are five major trait dimensions: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (OCEAN), also known as the Big Five (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992). Of the five traits, high neuroticism and low conscientiousness have been consistently associated with unhealthy eating behaviours (UEBs). For instance, highly neurotic individuals tend to consume more sweet, savoury and convenience foods (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015) and higher intakes of sugar and fats (Tiainen, et al., 2013). Individuals low in conscientiousness struggle controlling their impulses to eat unhealthy food over a healthier alternative (Elfhag &amp; Morey, 2008). Low conscientiousness has also been found to predict the consumption of foods indicative of an unhealthy diet (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015). Based on previous findings, it is hypothesised that there will be a significant positive correlation between neuroticism and UEBs, a significant negative correlation between conscientiousness and UEBs, and no significant relationship between openness to experience, extraversion or agreeableness and UEBs. Simply put, individuals high in neuroticism and low in conscientiousness will demonstrate more unhealthy eating habits. Method Participants A sample of 195 participants was recruited using an opportunity sample. Participants included 135 females (69.2%) and 60 males (30.8%) aged between 15 and 73 years (M = 26.6, SD = 13.1). Design A correlational design was used. The predictor variables were Big Five personality traits (with five levels: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism). The dependent variable was food frequency questionnaire scores. Materials Big Five Inventory (BFI). Personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory (BFI; John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008). The BFI is a 44-item, self-report questionnaire that is divided into subscales for each of the Big Five factors of personality (see Appendix A. The inventory consists of 44 brief statements (e.g. \u2018I see myself as someone who is talkative\u2019) that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u2018strongly disagree\u2019) to 5 (\u2018strongly agree\u2019). A mean score for each subscale was calculated and some of the items were reverse-scored. The BFI presents an average Cronbach\u2019s alpha of .83 and average test-retest reliability of .85 (John &amp; Srivastava, 1999). Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Food consumption was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ; Hartmann, Siegrist, &amp; van der Horst, 2012). The FFQ is a self adminstered, 182-item questionnaire grouped into four different categories; sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages, meat and convenience foods (see Appendix B). The fruit and vegatable category was excluded, as the present study focused on UEBs. These food groups were chosen because their excessive consumption had been shown to cause serious health problems. Participants were asked to report how often they consumed each item. Items relating to sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages and meat consumption were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (\u2018never\u2019) to 14 (\u2018several times per day\u2019). Items relating to convenience food consumption were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (\u2018never\u2019) to 7 (\u2018daily\u2019). Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.71 for sweets and savouries, 0.69 for sugar-sweetened drinks, 0.69 for meat and 0.71 for convenience foods. Items falling into each food group were summed to reflect consumption frequency of these foods per week. Procedure An online questionnaire was created using 44 items from the BFI and 182 items from the FFQ. After providing informed consent, participants were sent an email containing the link to a Google Forms survey. The survey consisted of three separate sections: demographics (gender, age), BFI and FFQ. Upon completion, participants were presented with a debrief page. The raw data set was retrieved from Google Forms as an Excel file. Then, the raw scores were converted into mean scores for the BFI and total scores for the FFQ. For the BFI, negatively keyed items were reverse scored to ensure respondents were providing consistent answers. Items were then coded to the appropriate subscales. A mean score between 1 and 5 was calculated for each BFI trait, by adding up the scores and dividing them by the number of items within that trait. The final data set of demographics, personality traits and eating behaviours was exported to Jamovi (The Jamovi Project, 2021) for analysis. Statistical analysis Pearson correlation was used to test the relationship between the Big Five traits and UEBs. Then, a multiple linear regression was performed to explore which personality traits were the best predictors for UEBs. The predictor variables that were hypothesised to be significant predictors were entered into the regression, i.e. conscientiousness and neuroticism. Results Table 1 shows that agreeableness had the highest mean score, while neuroticism had the lowest mean score as well as the highest variation. As the highest possible FFQ score was 182, the mean FFQ score suggests that overall, the sample was health conscious. Inferential statistics As shown in Table 2, there was a weak negative and statistically significant correlation between conscientiousness and FFQ score. No significant correlation was observed between neuroticism and FFQ score. Low conscientiousness and agreeableness, as well as high neuroticism, were more prominent in younger participants. Higher FFQ scores were also more common in younger participants. A multiple linear regression was performed to test whether conscientiousness and neuroticism signficantly predicted UEBs. The results of the regression indicated that the model explained 2.88% of the variance and that the model was not significant. It was found that conscientiousness was a signifcant predictor of UEBs, while neuroticism was not. Discussion The results of the present study support the hypothesis that conscientiousness is a signficiant predictor of UEBs. However, neuroticism is not a significant predictor of UEBs and therefore does not support the hypothesis. The results regarding conscientiousness are consistent with previous research, as they found that low concientiousness predicted the consumption of unhealthy food (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015). A few limitations could be addressed in future research. Firstly, the present study used self-reported measures of personality traits and eating habits. This presents the possibility of measurement errors and response biases, particularly social desirability. This may also explain why neuroticism was not found to be a significant predictor of UEBs, as the trait is perceived as socially undesirable. Another limitation is that participants were predominantly female. This creates a gender disparity and may limit the finding\u2019s generalisability to females only. Research has found gender differences in the relationship between personality traits and UEBs. For example, Conner, et al. (2017) found that high neuroticism led to UEBs in males only. Despite these limitations, understanding the influence of personality traits on eating habits is of paramount importance in developing effective interventions against unhealthy food intake that are tailored to each individual\u2019s characteristic traits. To conclude, the present study confirms the importance of the conscientiousness trait in eating behaviours. However, further research is required to assess whether health behaviour predictions based on personality are affected by gender and social desirability bias.", "positive": ", My name is ; I'm emailing to introduce myself and say hello.

{"id": "aug_237", "anchor": "Introduction In order to analyse to what extent English law\u2019s approach to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith is satisfactory, it important to understand that the fundamental attitude towards good faith and the recent developments in good faith, that lead to a paradox within the law. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd , Lord Bingham defined what good faith is synonymic to, which was \"playing fair\", \"coming clean\" or \"putting one\u2019s card face upwards on the table\". This approach has been embodied by most countries outside the common law world, whereby, there is an overriding principle of good faith. However, English law, tends to abide by a piecemeal technique, which means good faith is applied as and when it is needed, rather than a general law. Nonetheless, the courts have more recently signalled a departure from such approach, as it has become increasingly more common for courts to uphold the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, and in doing so, have caused a level of uncertainty within the law. This essay will argue that the approach Courts have taken to enforce promises to negotiate in good faith is in fact unsatisfactory. This essay develops, first, by explaining the general obligations of good faith and the traditional hostility towards it. Secondly, it will focus specifically on the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith and, whether, in fact, this has been enforceable. Finally, it will be explained that, despite the attempts to define what the Courts will uphold in relation to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate, it inevitably leads to courts being too involved in commercial business and therefore, undermines the commercial stability that England places on high importance. Traditional Views Towards Good Faith Historically, hostility towards the doctrine of good faith has been prevalent in English law. Traditionally, English law develops piecemeal solution in response to the specific problems they are faced with, rather than an imposing an overriding principle of good faith. The reasoning, for this, is it creates too much uncertainty and subjectivity, but arguably, more importantly, it allows for freedom of contract and party of autonomy. As put by, Sir Roy Goode \"in what we like to think \u2013 perhaps wrongly \u2013 is the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice. It is necessary in a commercial setting that businessmen at least should know where they stand.\" Thus, indicating, why the original approach to good faith, is satisfactory because it leads to commercial certainty, which is ingrained into English law. This is fundamental to the core, further evidenced, by the fact \"the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice.\" Conversely, this certainty that is placed on such high importance in English law, is being undermined by the exceptions where English law does recognise good faith, one of them being express promises to negotiate in good faith. Thus, meaning it is enforceable in courts. Many of these express terms to negotiate are based on the perception that both parties will be entering a joint venture, as there would be an intention to create a long term relation and parties may set out commitments for a specific time. The declarations made in the House of Lords decisions of HIH Casualty v Chase Manhattan Bank , Lord Hoffman observes that it goes without saying that underlying the contractual arrangement of the parties there will be a common assumption that the parties involved will behave honestly. Although, there may be express terms to negotiate in good faith, the nature of these relationships alone, should call for honest, open and fair dealing. This is considered to be a relational contract. Leggatt LJ explains that communication and co-operation is based on trust and loyalty might be crucial and impliedly expected by the parties, even if not expressly stated in contract. However, there is an issue with this definition as it has been criticised for a lack of explanation, as put by Severine Saintier, Leggatt J does not elaborate as to what relational contracts are precisely, why they require such enhanced good faithloyalty or what this would entail, which is regrettable. Such criticism simply strengthens the Court\u2019s previously hostile approach to the doctrine; due to the ambiguity in interpretation of the doctrine as there are no guidelines as to how the Court is to identify \"good faith\", and so is often done so subjectively. Express Promises To Negotiate In Good Faith Nevertheless, express terms to promise to negotiate in good faith, has been favoured and welcomed; due to the flexibility and adaptability it allows for within the contract. The freedom of inserting an article that mandates a negotiation, means that parties are able to prepare themselves for future, as the future is uncertain, they are unable to dictate what the commercial environment may look like in 20 years. For instance, events, such as a recession or a plummet in the market by including a term that opens the door for renegotiations in relation to the specific term. Cases, such as Petromec , the clause was 12.4 , where it states that \u2018 Brasoil agrees to negotiate in good faith with Petromc the extra costs..\u2019 This term emphasises why parties may include an express term in the contract for future insulation against potential risks that may occur. Enforceability of Promises to Negotiate through Development of Law. Case law paves the way for the enforceability of contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, by refining the scope of good faith. Walford v Miles, the case was as follows, the business owner promised the plaintiffs that it would terminate negotiations to sell business to third party, however, the business owner then sold the business to a third party. The plaintiffs argued that the business owner had a duty to negotiate in good faith. However, it was held that the promise to negotiate was unenforceable. Lord Ackner to be \"unworkable\" and \"inherently repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in negotiations.\" It is imperative for distinctions to be made between a good faith duty which governs pre \u2013 contractual relations and of those that concern a contractual performance, as well as the contrast between terms that are expressly codified for the intrusion of a duty of good faith. In light of this intricacy, Longmore LJ took on the role of understanding the criticisms that the courts have had with upholding a promise to negotiate, he pointed out three main arguments; one of them being that the obligation is an agreement to agree and this is too uncertain to enforce.. However, he dismissed this argument by stating that is carries little weight because the obligation on the facts was an express obligation in a contract that was otherwise enforceable. By arguing, these main points Longmore LJ has narrowed the vagueness, and this is best shown in the comparison of Walford v Miles and Petromec Inc v Petroleo, in the Walford case the contract was still to come into the effect of the good faith arrangement as it was still in the pre \u2013 negotiation stage, the contract was never concluded. However, in Petromec, it was clear that it was not just a bare agreement to negotiation, as it was a complex contract drafted by their lawyers. This case, is a crucial turning point in relation to promises to negotiate in good faith, as it maintains party autonomy and freedom of contract, which as mentioned is fundamental to Englands commercial environment, therefore, allows for a consistent and coherent standard of how express terms are upheld by the courts. The Quota To Satisfy Shaker v Visajet, was yet another case that was consistent with the way the Courts uphold express promises to negotiate in good faith. In this case, there was a promise to \u2018proceed in good faith\u2019 as well as \u2018use reasonable endeavours\u2019 to agree a documentation pursuant to the purchase of an aircraft. Teare J stated that there was no binding legal obligation based on the promise. The reason for this was because there was \u2018no objective criteria\u2019, that the court was able to decide whether the party acted unreasonably. This further enhances the distinction using Petromec , because in the case, there was sufficient objective criteria to make the promise enforceable. However, Shaker, meant that the courts devised a test in order to see if the express promises to negotiate is enforceable; the test requires two questions to be satisfied. The first criteria to meet is, \u2018is there a certainty of object?\u2019, this relates to clarity in what the negotiation was set out to achieve e.g. responding to a change in the circumstances. The second is \u2018 are there sufficient objective criteria to determine what a good faith negotiation looks like in the context of this particular contract?\u2019 This criteria relates to the idea that the Courts should be able to look at the contract and have the exact information to uncover, what the negotiation should look like in good faith. These cases all draw to the same conclusion that promises to negotiate in good faith should be upheld and is attempted to be done so by the Courts by using precedence, the courts should not avoid enforceability due to some vagueness, on how the term is to be upheld in practical contexts. Upholding the contract leading too much involvement Parties requiring terms to be upheld and enforced necessitates a court to work out what a good faith negotiation looks like in that contract, in fact it is vital to do so, because it is the only way to conclude if there has been a breach or not. There is too much vagueness surrounding the good faith negotiation, which inevitably leads to the Courts having to fill in the blanks, in essence leading them to \u2018make\u2019 the contracts for the parties. In fact, this interpretation is considered to take up more judicial time than all other areas of the law of contract put together. Although, Lord Hoffman came up with five principles governing how the courts should interpret written contracts, there was a lot of backlash for this as it was \u2018It was said to generate uncertainty because it appeared to widen the circumstances in which the judges could depart from the \u2018natural and ordinary meaning\u2019 of the words used by the parties.\u2019 The underlying issue is that, regardless, of how precise the terms are, it will inevitably lead to courts getting too involved in interpreting the contract and assuming what the parties meant instead of what they actually wrote. This in turn generates too much uncertainty and threatens the stability of the commercial environment. Alternatives to solve uncertainty Although, a common option for both parties is to include an arbitration, which is an alternate way of settling a dispute outside of courts, however, this has been criticised because the existence of the arbitration obligation specifically incorporated into clause itself indicates strongly that the parties were not intending to retain their freedom to agree or disagree according to their perceived interests. More importantly, as highlighted in the Emirates Trading and Associated British Ports, it leads to satellite litigation, meaning the parties go to Court arguing about not the specific breach of the contract but a separate matter arising from this, in the Emirates Trading case, it was about whether the good faith negotiation term was in fact enforceable. Satellite litigation is undesirable and in fact takes up the Courts resources and arguably, \"tends not to help with either expedition or the saving of expense and perhaps more than anything leads to disproportionality.\" Ironically, the very reason why the express promise to negotiate was avoid long-drawn-out dispute and going to court by resolving them through friendly discussions of good faith. Thus, indicating that going to court may lead to better solutions for the parties, simultaneously, altering the position and standpoint of the traditional view held by the English courts. Conclusion To conclude, express promises to negotiate in good faith is upholding, although it has been consistent and the requirements have been made unambiguous through case law and the enforceability by the Courts have also been constant, aiding the reliability and validity. However, the issue with the Court enforcing the express terms is that, they have to work out the good faith in the negotiation, but by doing this it means that the courts are at high risk of making the parties contracts for them. This creates the worry that the commercial stability in England would be threatened because it means party autonomy is not at the priority, as well, as freedom of contract. Both of these element are considered to be central to the English law, in relation to commercial law.", "positive": "lo, Do I have to state all of the placement start dates now?

{"id": "aug_241", "anchor": "Thank you for visiting. Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders? To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee\u2019s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work. Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders? To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant\u2019s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC. Procedural requirements Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline. If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is \u00a352,000, any award exceeding \u00a325,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal. I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed. Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute. If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim? You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects, as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder\u2019s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. WDC Prospect It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee\u2019s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover. In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks\u2019 notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks\u2019 notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks\u2019 worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. UDC Prospect It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal\u2019s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. Applying this, WW may use \u2018other substantial reason,\u2019 ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be \u2018misconduct,\u2019 regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years. Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option? Please find below a list of options available to you. Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder\u2019s behaviour. Advantages: \u2022 You continue to have a regular job and income. \u2022 No stress about finding alternative work. \u2022 Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. Disadvantage: \u2022 Narinder\u2019s disrespectful behaviour may not change. \u2022 The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder\u2019s behaviour. Advantages: \u2022 Same as Option 1. \u2022 WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder\u2019s behaviour. \u2022 WW may assign you a new line manager. Disadvantage: \u2022 Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. Advantages: \u2022 Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. Disadvantage: \u2022 Same as Options 1-2. Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. Advantages: \u2022 You will be free from Narinder\u2019s treatment. \u2022 You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them. \u2022 You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. Disadvantages: \u2022 You will be unemployed after your notice period. \u2022 Stressful finding another job. Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC. Advantages: \u2022 You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. \u2022 You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour. \u2022 Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity. Disadvantages: \u2022 Same as Option 4. \u2022 There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim? WDC The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks\u2019 worth salary (\u00a310,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately \u00a34,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (\u00a31,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your \u2018Christmas [bonus]\u2019 regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual \u2018right[s] to receive.\u2019 Currently, you have taken two days\u2019 leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days\u2019 worth salary (\u00a33,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. Your compensation totals \u00a319,263.96. This includes notice salary (\u00a310,000), Pension (\u00a34,000), untaken leave (\u00a33,703.96) and Christmas bonus (\u00a31,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals \u00a317,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals \u00a311,763.96 or \u00a310,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal\u2019s maximum award of \u00a325,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. UDC The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. Basic Award Tribunal will award you \u00a36,300 based on your weekly gross salary (\u00a3525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. Compensatory Award The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (\u00a378,000), as it is below \u00a386,444 cap. This may be lower (\u00a325,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job. If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (\u00a384,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this. The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. Additional information Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract. Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. Yours Sincerely,", "positive": "y loves YouTube.

{"id": "aug_246", "anchor": "An unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for chronic health problems, such as obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that personality traits may make an individual more susceptible to unhealthy eating habits. A personality trait reflects a person\u2019s characteristic pattern of thinking, feeling and behaving (Soto, 2018). According to the Five Factor Model of personality, there are five major trait dimensions: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (OCEAN), also known as the Big Five (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992). Of the five traits, high neuroticism and low conscientiousness have been consistently associated with unhealthy eating behaviours (UEBs). For instance, highly neurotic individuals tend to consume more sweet, savoury and convenience foods (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015) and higher intakes of sugar and fats (Tiainen, et al., 2013). Individuals low in conscientiousness struggle controlling their impulses to eat unhealthy food over a healthier alternative (Elfhag &amp; Morey, 2008). Low conscientiousness has also been found to predict the consumption of foods indicative of an unhealthy diet (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015). Based on previous findings, it is hypothesised that there will be a significant positive correlation between neuroticism and UEBs, a significant negative correlation between conscientiousness and UEBs, and no significant relationship between openness to experience, extraversion or agreeableness and UEBs. Simply put, individuals high in neuroticism and low in conscientiousness will demonstrate more unhealthy eating habits. Method Participants A sample of 195 participants was recruited using an opportunity sample. Participants included 135 females (69.2%) and 60 males (30.8%) aged between 15 and 73 years (M = 26.6, SD = 13.1). Design A correlational design was used. The predictor variables were Big Five personality traits (with five levels: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism). The dependent variable was food frequency questionnaire scores. Materials Big Five Inventory (BFI). Personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory (BFI; John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008). The BFI is a 44-item, self-report questionnaire that is divided into subscales for each of the Big Five factors of personality (see Appendix A. The inventory consists of 44 brief statements (e.g. \u2018I see myself as someone who is talkative\u2019) that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u2018strongly disagree\u2019) to 5 (\u2018strongly agree\u2019). A mean score for each subscale was calculated and some of the items were reverse-scored. The BFI presents an average Cronbach\u2019s alpha of .83 and average test-retest reliability of .85 (John &amp; Srivastava, 1999). Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Food consumption was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ; Hartmann, Siegrist, &amp; van der Horst, 2012). The FFQ is a self adminstered, 182-item questionnaire grouped into four different categories; sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages, meat and convenience foods (see Appendix B). The fruit and vegatable category was excluded, as the present study focused on UEBs. These food groups were chosen because their excessive consumption had been shown to cause serious health problems. Participants were asked to report how often they consumed each item. Items relating to sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages and meat consumption were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (\u2018never\u2019) to 14 (\u2018several times per day\u2019). Items relating to convenience food consumption were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (\u2018never\u2019) to 7 (\u2018daily\u2019). Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.71 for sweets and savouries, 0.69 for sugar-sweetened drinks, 0.69 for meat and 0.71 for convenience foods. Items falling into each food group were summed to reflect consumption frequency of these foods per week. Procedure An online questionnaire was created using 44 items from the BFI and 182 items from the FFQ. After providing informed consent, participants were sent an email containing the link to a Google Forms survey. The survey consisted of three separate sections: demographics (gender, age), BFI and FFQ. Upon completion, participants were presented with a debrief page. The raw data set was retrieved from Google Forms as an Excel file. Then, the raw scores were converted into mean scores for the BFI and total scores for the FFQ. For the BFI, negatively keyed items were reverse scored to ensure respondents were providing consistent answers. Items were then coded to the appropriate subscales. A mean score between 1 and 5 was calculated for each BFI trait, by adding up the scores and dividing them by the number of items within that trait. The final data set of demographics, personality traits and eating behaviours was exported to Jamovi (The Jamovi Project, 2021) for analysis. Statistical analysis Pearson correlation was used to test the relationship between the Big Five traits and UEBs. Then, a multiple linear regression was performed to explore which personality traits were the best predictors for UEBs. The predictor variables that were hypothesised to be significant predictors were entered into the regression, i.e. conscientiousness and neuroticism. Results Table 1 shows that agreeableness had the highest mean score, while neuroticism had the lowest mean score as well as the highest variation. As the highest possible FFQ score was 182, the mean FFQ score suggests that overall, the sample was health conscious. Inferential statistics As shown in Table 2, there was a weak negative and statistically significant correlation between conscientiousness and FFQ score. No significant correlation was observed between neuroticism and FFQ score. Low conscientiousness and agreeableness, as well as high neuroticism, were more prominent in younger participants. Higher FFQ scores were also more common in younger participants. A multiple linear regression was performed to test whether conscientiousness and neuroticism signficantly predicted UEBs. The results of the regression indicated that the model explained 2.88% of the variance and that the model was not significant. It was found that conscientiousness was a signifcant predictor of UEBs, while neuroticism was not. Discussion The results of the present study support the hypothesis that conscientiousness is a signficiant predictor of UEBs. However, neuroticism is not a significant predictor of UEBs and therefore does not support the hypothesis. The results regarding conscientiousness are consistent with previous research, as they found that low concientiousness predicted the consumption of unhealthy food (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015). A few limitations could be addressed in future research. Firstly, the present study used self-reported measures of personality traits and eating habits. This presents the possibility of measurement errors and response biases, particularly social desirability. This may also explain why neuroticism was not found to be a significant predictor of UEBs, as the trait is perceived as socially undesirable. Another limitation is that participants were predominantly female. This creates a gender disparity and may limit the finding\u2019s generalisability to females only. Research has found gender differences in the relationship between personality traits and UEBs. For example, Conner, et al. (2017) found that high neuroticism led to UEBs in males only. Despite these limitations, understanding the influence of personality traits on eating habits is of paramount importance in developing effective interventions against unhealthy food intake that are tailored to each individual\u2019s characteristic traits. To conclude, the present study confirms the importance of the conscientiousness trait in eating behaviours. However, further research is required to assess whether health behaviour predictions based on personality are affected by gender and social desirability bias.", "positive": "ave sent evidence in my previous email to show I couldn't log into the telephony ( ) system, as I did not have my login.

{"id": "aug_254", "anchor": ", Honestly, it's scary at first but just so amazing especially because (as silly as this sounds) I don't think we are exposed enough to different cultures here. Yes! To be honest, I never considered it either until contacted me asking me to consider as my grammar was quite bad in second year. Maybe you could look into a study placement for the language you feel weaker with? Answering your questions: I just found that I was benefitting a lot from the course I was doing and was noticing that my was genuinely improving. I was also just thinking about what was more beneficial for me in the future (as in for final year) and genuinely I was just really enjoying being in a very multicultural environment so didn't want to leave. Also my second placement that I was supposed to be on was an English speaking placement in so again didn't feel like I wouldn't benefit as much from it. So I did have a second placement lined up for my second semester as a for a company called in (also, don't listen to everything the placement team tells you because they just want you to get any placement not necessarily a good one). When I was on my study placement, I decided quite early on that I didn't want to do the work placement (it was also because I wouldnt have been able to afford to live in so make sure you look at that when looking for placements because the placements team don't think about finance) so I just emailed them and told them for personal reasons I couldn't continue and they were fine about it. I'm going to be honest with you....I didn't apply until for placements because I was too scared to and also had some mental health issues in second year but don't leave it this late!! I would say start looking in (that's when all the big ones like etc open) and don't just apply for anything, make sure you apply for what YOU want to do or are interested in as the placements team don't really take this into consideration. I made both but for a study placement application you don't need one you just have to write a short essay about why you would be a good candidate for that University and then for the other one I only had to send my English CV but i would recommend doing both as it's good practice for the future and there are modules in second year to help you do this so make sure you use the language assistants as much as possible.

{"id": "aug_256", "anchor": "Thank you for having visited Thrills and Spills LLP this morning. Can you make a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders? Wrongful dismissals arise when an employer unjustifiably breaches one or more fundamental terms in an employment contract, resulting in an employee suffering a loss of benefits. To be eligible to claim, three requirements must be met. As a \u2018Wildlife Cameraman\u2019 for Wildlife Wonders Limited, you meet the first element of being an employee. The second is that you must have been dismissed. An employer can constructively dismiss an employee by placing them in a position where they can no longer be expected to tolerate such treatment and as a result, they resign. To successfully argue this, you must demonstrate that Wildlife Wonders committed a fundamental breach and you resigned, at least partly, in response to it. Your job title and duties as a Wildlife Cameraman were reassigned by Narinder, without a consultation - this variation usually requires a mutual decision. Despite remaining in accounting for 6 months, your reluctance will demonstrate that you have not affirmed or accepted this change and that Wildlife Wonders have subsequently breached your contract. There is also a duty of mutual trust and confidence implied into every contract. A mere dispute cannot seriously damage the relationship between both parties. However, statements, such as Narinder\u2019s disrespectful and humiliating comments at the award ceremony, can. By resigning effective immediately the morning after the final incident, you can emphasise that your working environment was intolerable. The final requirement is that you must have suffered a loss by not receiving all of the benefits you were entitled to, as a consequence of Wildlife Wonders breaching your contract. If your contract has a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) clause, you would no longer be suffering a loss. This is important as it would invalidate a wrongful dismissal claim. Provided there is not one, and all other criteria is met, you can claim wrongful dismissal. Can you make an unfair dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders? As an employee for Wildlife Wonders, you have the right not to be unfairly dismissed. Unfair dismissals occur when employers fail to provide a fair reason, or fail to follow a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. You will satisfy the initial eligibility criteria for this claim, as you have been continuously employed for 10 years and are not part of an excluded class of employees. Next, you must show that you were constructively dismissed, which I have already covered. It is likely Wildlife Wonders would rely on your capabilities as their fair reason for dismissal. Poor performance and financial difficulty could also be argued as some other substantial reason. Capability references skill and aptitude, and you mentioned that you have failed to capture any decent footage for several years. Wildlife Wonders could subsequently argue that you are no longer competent in your position and are incapable of doing your job. Narinder has set you increasingly challenging projects, but this is irrelevant. Lastly, it must be determined if Wildlife Wonders acted fair and reasonably in treating the reason they provided as sufficient to warrant a dismissal. Tribunals will look at a range of responses that a reasonable employer might take; your personal attributes, such as your previous work record and excellent reputation, will be considered favourably. As a reasonable employer, Wildlife Wonders is expected to have inquired into a problem and considered alternative options before dismissing you. Narinder did not provide you with a consultation when she reassigned you, nor was she required to, but it is a factor that will weigh negatively when determining the reasonableness of her actions. What are the procedural requirements for wrongful dismissal? There are two venues in which you can bring a wrongful dismissal claim \u2013 A court or an employment tribunal. In an ordinary court, a part 6 form must be presented within 6 years of the dismissal taking place. The last day you can initiate a claim in this court is Wednesday 25th November 2026. An employment tribunal will require the completion of an ET1 form, that outlines the details of the claim along with the remedy you seek. I would encourage you to take this route. Unless not reasonably practical, three calendar months is the time limit placed on initiating proceedings. This is calculated from the day you terminated your employment and is known as the effective date of termination. This date cannot be fixed regardless of any prior agreement. In your case, it is Thursday 26th November 2020, meaning the last day you can submit a claim is Wednesday 25th February 2021. It is my recommendation that you act as soon as possible and do not wait until the time-limit has elapsed. What are the procedural requirements for unfair dismissal? An unfair dismissal claim must also be presented at an employment tribunal. Accordingly, the same claim form and time limits mentioned for employment tribunals under wrongful dismissal, apply. Prior to commencing unfair dismissal proceedings, you are required to contact the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), and attempt early conciliation. An additional month is added to the time limit in order to allow for this. A conciliation officer will seek to promote reemployment or a settlement between you and Wildlife Wonders, where it is just and equitable to do so. However, if they are unable to resolve the issue, a conciliation certificate will be issued, allowing you to proceed with your claim in a tribunal. What are your prospects of success? The burden is on you to prove you are eligible to claim wrongful dismissal. There is no defence that Wildlife Wonders can depend on, other than disproving your eligibility. Constructive dismissal can be difficult to prove and they are likely to challenge this element. The legal test applied is whether someone in the same position as yourself, would view Narinder\u2019s actions as an intention to abandon the contract. Considering she disregarded your job title and duties when transferring you to the accounting department, and followed it with no discussion or explanation, it would be fair to assume this intention was sufficiently clear. A court or tribunal is interested in what triggered your resignation. The \u2018final straw\u2019 you mentioned in our meeting, Narinder disrespecting and publically humiliating you, will be the focus here. Alone, it is unlikely to be sufficient to justify your resignation. However, you\u2019re entitled to rely on the totality of her actions. Therefore, this in conjunction to her variating your contract terms, will allow you to succeed in a wrongful dismissal claim. Your prospects with an unfair dismissal claim will depend on whether Wildlife Wonders can prove the reason and procedure they undertook for dismissal was fair and reasonable. As I mentioned previously, your inability to capture decent footage over the last 2-3 years, could be accepted as a fair reason. The size and administrative resources of the company will be relevant to the outcome, as their loss of confidence in your abilities could be consequently seen as a fair response. Despite this, small companies are not excused from following proper procedures. Moreover, If Narinder was dissatisfied with your capabilities, then she should have followed ACAS guidelines on how to address the problem. Instead, she repeatedly avoided and ignored your requests for explanations. As such, it is likely that Wildlife Wonders will successfully argue their reason for dismissal as being fair, however, they will struggle to convince a tribunal that their procedure was reasonable. What are your options and what are the advantagesdisadvantages of pursing each one? Option 1: Apply to ACAS and seek a settlement The advantages include saving the time, aggravation and cost of claiming. You will also, hopefully, be listened to by Wildlife Wonders and have an opportunity to negotiate on the matters most important to you, for instance the company car. The disadvantages are that a settlement might not be reached and you will have to endure the process of claiming on top of adhering to the early conciliation process. Furthermore, you may inadvertently reveal your deep interest in the company car to your hindrance. Option 2: Claim wrongful dismissal The advantages include receiving - without having to earn them - all benefits you\u2019d have received had you worked your notice period. The disadvantages are the cost and aggravation of claiming and being out of work with no regular salary, coupled with the stress of seeking alternative employment. Option 3: Claim unfair dismissal The advantages are the same as for option 2, but you may also be offered reemployment, which would save the loss of salary and stress of seeking alternative employment during a pandemic. The disadvantages are the same as for option 2. My considered advice re the best option I feel option 3 would be the most beneficial to you, as this is where you\u2019ll be best compensated for your current circumstances. However, it is crucial that you reflect and make this decision yourself. What remedies are available to you for wrongful dismissal? Three types of remedies are available to a successful wrongful dismissal claimant \u2013 I believe the one most relevant to you is financial compensation. You will be restored to the position you would have been in, had Wildlife Wonders performed their contractual obligations. Only the losses that are reasonably foreseeable can be recovered. A tribunal\u2019s award for wrongful dismissal is capped at \u00a325,000. This is something to keep in mind when deciding which venue to initiate a claim in. You will be compensated for all of the benefits you would have been entitled to, had you worked their notice period. Your contract offers you only 8 weeks\u2019 notice, however, you are legally entitled to 10. For loss of salary, Wildlife Wonders will be ordered to pay 10-weeks\u2019 worth of your net pay - \u00a310,000. For your untaken holiday, you will be paid in lieu \u00a34,000. I will be consulting a pension specialist to estimate the value of your pension entitlement. As you have access to a final salary pension scheme, you will be compensated generously. This is because it is almost impossible to find new employment offering this comprehensive package. You won\u2019t be compensated for benefits that your employer is not contractually obliged to provide. Yet, you may still be entitled to your Christmas bonus, despite the word \u2018discretionary\u2019 being used in the clause. I understand you would like to retain possession of the company Land Rover. Were the weekend trips you described for personal or work purposes? If you can prove you used the vehicle in your private life, then you might be able to keep it. I would advise you not to reveal to Wildlife Wonders your strong desire to keep the car, or this will be used against you during negotiations. Unfortunately, no award is issued for injury to feelings or for the manner in which you were dismissed, even though Narinder shaming you in front of industry professionals might make it harder for you to get another job. What remedies are available to you for unfair dismissal? A tribunal could make you an order for reengagement. I am aware that you are adamant you will never work for them again and a tribunal would not recommend this remedy if it is likely to promote further issues. However, there is no harm in knowing all of the options available to you. Under this order, you would be offered suitable or comparable employment to what you had prior to your dismissal. Should you wish, you could resume your previous position as \u2018Wildlife Cameraman\u2019. Non-compliance by Wildlife Wonders, allows the tribunal to increase your award by up to 25%. Financial compensation for unfair dismissal consists of a basic and a compensatory award that are summed together. The basic award is a precise figure and compensates you for the loss of job security. In your case, the total amount a tribunal will offer you here is \u00a36,456. For the compensatory award, tribunals determine what would be fair to award a successful claimant by assessing any loss deriving from the employer\u2019s actions in the dismissal. You cannot receive an amount higher than your gross salary, thus, the maximum amount available to you for this compensation element is \u00a378,000. You will be compensated for the immediate loss of benefits you are entitled to receive, between the dismissal and the date of the hearing. The current wait time is roughly 38-weeks, and it\u2019ll likely rise due to the Covid-19 crisis. This will subsequently increase the value of your award. Your future loss is also calculated for the period between the end of your notice period and the time it takes you to find new employment. A tribunal will likely compensate you for a considerable amount of time, as the current pandemic will make it more difficult to find new employment. The same calculations as wrongful dismissal applies here, for your bonus and other fringe benefits. Although, your pension value will additionally encompass both the loss of your current position, and the loss of future pension opportunity. As such, you\u2019ll receive a higher pension amount for unfair dismissal. Furthermore, should your employer fail to follow ACAS, an increase of up to 25% could be made to the value of your award. Similarly, if you fail to do so, then up to 25% can be deducted. In addition, if Wildlife Wonders fail to make payment within 42 days of an order being issued, interest be payable on all tribunal awards, further increasing your total compensation amount. You have an obligation to take steps to lessen and reduce the loss you accumulate as a result of your dismissal from Wildlife Wonders. I therefore encourage you to make a real effort in seeking alternative employment and keep a record of all job applications and responses. You\u2019re not expected to accept less favourable terms, unless you\u2019re unemployed for a considerable amount of time, in which case it reasonable to accept an inferior position. You can recover any expenses reasonably incurred in mitigating your loss; this includes the cost of newspapers to search for jobs, and even the cost of relocating. Needless to say, please keep your receipts. If Wildlife Wonders can convince a tribunal that the dismissal was to any extent caused by you, then a deduction will be made. Tribunals will take a broad, common sense view when assessing this deduction, and your poor performance is unlikely to be sufficient to satisfy the necessary culpable or blameworthy element. Other information I feel is relevant It would be helpful if you could email me a copy of your contract, so that I can check any further benefits you may be entitled to. I will also need to confirm whether or not there is a PILON clause, which would prevent you from claiming wrongful dismissal. In the meantime, you need to check with Wildlife Wonders\u2019 HR department to see if you have opted out of the working time regulations. If you have, you\u2019ll forfeit your entitlement to untaken holiday and your compensation amount will be reduced. Please email or write to Wildlife Wonders confirming your resignation and the reasons for it. I stress that no further action can be embarked on until you have taken this step. Failure to do so will invalidate any claim available to you, as you will not have been properly constructively dismissed. If you wish to discuss any questions, please do not hesitate to telephone me. I will contact you at the end of next week, on Friday, to discuss further instructions after you have had time to reflect.

Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging \u00c2\u00a3163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros.

I therefore effectively communicated with the programme director by asking her if the can have a slot at the induction lecture.

{"id": "aug_264", "anchor": "Both the biological and psychoanalytic approaches seek to explain human behaviour. The biological approach proposes the idea that all psychological problems are rooted in physiological causes, whereas the psychoanalytic approach suggests that behaviour is due to unconscious forces and childhood experiences. The key features of these approaches are distinct from each other and have their uses and limitations, yet, both are still widely used in psychology. The biological approach prevails over other psychological approaches due to the fact that its explanations encompass anatomy, physiology and the role of neurological function. This approach accepts the idea of materialism as it assumes that all behaviour has a physical basis. This opposes the previously accepted idea of dualism, in which it was believed that the body and the mind are separate but interacting entities. The shift from dualism to materialism was supported with work by Paul Broca (1861). In studying a patient called \u2018Tan\u2019, Broca discovered that there was a direct link between the articulation of speech and damage to a particular cortical region. This area was later named \u2018Broca\u2019s area\u2019 and pioneered the idea that particular cognitive functions can be localised to areas in the cerebral cortex (Grodzinsky &amp; Amunts, 2006). Localisation of brain function is a central concept to the biological approach. Broca (1861) and Wernicke\u2019s (1874) findings were some of the first to show that damage to cortical areas produces a change in language. A significant drawback of these findings was that they were concluded from limited post-mortem evidence, which makes it difficult to show the specificity of location. The mechanism of speech may be something that is controlled by multiple areas, so damage to any one of these areas may produce the same effect (Myers, 2007). Recent research by Delgado and Hamlin (1956) demonstrated how stimulation of the motor cortex using electrodes led to specific physical reactions. In one individual the left motor cortex was stimulated, and it was found that the right fist would clench. This provided support for the latter idea that the cerebral cortex is split into four lobes, each relating to a different function (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). Another feature of the biological perspective is the idea of brain communication through the use of neurotransmitters. These chemicals are involved in regulating processes in the body such as emotion. If there is a biochemical imbalance in these systems, this may in turn affect human behaviour. A review by Seo and Patrick (2008) demonstrated how a deficiency in serotonin combined with high levels of dopamine interact together in the prefrontal cortex and may predispose individuals to aggressive behaviour. This follows the diathesis-stress model in stating how irregularities in biological systems may predispose individuals to certain conditions which manifest after being triggered. This shows that contrary to general assumption, the biological approach does not entirely ignore the role of nature in human behaviour. It acknowledges that biology may be just the precursor to abnormal behaviour. Empiricism is an essential component in understanding the functioning behind biological systems. Experiments such as Delgado and Hamlin, (1956) and Seo and Patrick, (2008) show that being deeply embedded in the observational methods of science provides an advantage of the biological approach over others. This level of empiricism means that studies can be easily replicated. Likewise, the possibility of direct manipulation of a variable and the observation of the response means that valid conclusions can be drawn. From this, researchers are then able to take away evidence that helps support concepts such as neurotransmitter effects. As the biological approach follows the law of parsimony, it often finds itself being criticised for being too reductionist. Complex behaviour is simplified down to individual physiological mechanisms. For example, the concept of being able to produce language is reduced to the interactions between neurones in the frontal lobe when the explanation behind this may be far more intricate. This approach is also deterministic as biological processes are exempt from our free will. If aggression is due to neurotransmitter abnormality, this suggests that there is no control over the behaviour exhibited. However, evidence by Van Lier, Vitaro and Eisner (2007) has shown how peer rejection in children can lead to maladaptive behaviours, including aggression. This demonstrates how an environmental rather than a biological factor can lead to an individual choosing to express their aggressive behaviour. An alternative to this is the psychoanalytic approach which was developed by Sigmund Freud in 1896. One of the concepts Freud introduced was that personality development is moulded by childhood experiences and fixations, namely the psychosexual stages of development. He theorised that all children go through the oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stages in which the individual is focused on obtaining pleasure through the specific areas. In each of these stages, there is the possibility for fixation to occur. If this occurs at any stage, personality development into adulthood may be affected (Fennald, 1997). A second concept is that personality is split into the id, ego and superego which are unconscious forces that influence our decisions and motives. The id contains sexual instincts (libido) and aggressive instincts (Eysenck, 1988). The superego reflects the moral standards of society, restricting the id from making decisions which would not be allowed and the ego is the decision maker, mediating between the two (Jarvis, 2000). There is substantial contemporary evidence to suggest that Freud was correct in some of his propositions, like his idea of unconscious cognitive processes. Research by Westen (1999) looks to explain how the activation of particular unconscious associative networks influences ongoing thoughts, feelings and behaviour outside our awareness. Westen theorised that when networks associated with a particular situation are activated, this spreads to other neural networks and increases the likelihood of interpreting a situation in a certain way. This supports Freud\u2019s idea by showing how a previous experience, stored in the unconscious, is able to influence future interactions. The psychoanalytic approach has advantages over the biological approach by taking a multifaceted view and acknowledging both sides of the nature-nurture debate. The role of nature is considered in how innate drives influence our thoughts, and the role of nurture in how childhood experiences elicit behaviour. Consequently, this approach has similarities with the biological in assuming determinism. Behaviour in adult life is affected by the fixation of libido which suggests that we are shaped by irrepressible forces that are exempt from free will. The scientific status of the psychoanalytic approach is called into question on multiple occasions which puts it at a disadvantage to the biological approach. Variables are not manipulated, which makes it difficult to produce causal conclusions, and therefore leads to issues with the falsifiability. Freud\u2019s theories were based upon untested observations in a purely therapeutic situation. Qualitative research derived from case studies are a less reliable source of information and Freud only used 12 over the lifespan of his published work (Eysenck, 2000). However, more contemporary research by Fonagy and Bateman (1999) has shown how the psychoanalytic approach has evolved over time to incorporate more controlled data-gathering methods. In order to test the effectiveness of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalisation as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), Fonagy and Bateman (1999) conducted a randomised control trial and assessed outcome measures such as number of admissions, frequency of suicide attempts and symptom distress. There was a well-structured methodological approach to this study, including the use of DSM-III-R criteria to assess for BPD before participants were randomly assigned to the two groups. This study is an example of how the psychoanalytic approach should not be completely disregarded as non-scientific as current research looks to improve the legitimacy of methods that are used. In conclusion, the biological and the psychoanalytic approach parallel each other in terms of their determinism and their perspective on nature. However, the biological approach has an advantage over the psychoanalytic approach as it is empirical and has a strong scientific basis which supports its credibility. The early concepts of the psychoanalytic approach are difficult to falsify but on the other hand, contemporary psychoanalytic research has since developed to include more rigorous scientific procedures. Despite issues with both approaches, key features have their place in psychology today with localisation of brain function, the action of neurotransmitters and unconscious cognitive processes still being widely accepted.", "positive": "team, Thankyou very much that has cleared things up.

{"id": "aug_270", "anchor": "ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition, characterised by the co-occurrence of impairments in social interaction, communication development and restrictedrepetitive behaviours (RRBs) (Bakhtiari et al (2012). Advances in brain scanning techniques seen in the past two decades (such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), has provided a unique opportunity to assess brain connectivity and how differences relative to the neurotypical brain, may contribute to the profile of behaviours seen in ASD. Underconnectivity theory hypothesises that ASD and its characteristic deficits is caused as a direct result of under functioning in integrative circuitry, that results in an impairment of information integration at neuralcognitive levels (Just et al., 2004). Just et al (2004) tested this hypothesis, using 17 high functioning ASD individuals compared with typically developing (TD) matched controls, paired on the basis of verbal IQ. All participants completed a sentence comprehension task whilst in an fMRI scanner, assessing functional connectivity between the language areas of the brain. It was found that ASD individuals showed a large systematic difference in distribution of brain activity relative to TD controls, with posterior left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke\u2019s area) activation being greater in ASD and left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca\u2019s area) activation greater in control participants. Furthermore, it was seen that functional connectivity between the language areas in ASD was lower throughout the cortical language systems in comparison to controls. Just et al (2004) suggests these findings have implications for the behaviours seen in ASD, namely atypical strengths in processing single words but deficits in interpreting complex sentences and stories. This may in turn account for the difficulties seen in ASD when interpreting homographs (Happ\u00e9, 2011). It is speculated that this underconnectivity between cortical regions applies to other higher-level functions. Research assessing theory of mind (ToM), specifically mentalising, in ASD individuals supports this (Castelli et al., 2002). Castelli et al (2002) found that individuals with ASD were less accurate and offered less interpretations during a mental state attribution task relative to controls and that this correlated with reduced activation in the brain\u2019s mentalising network. Despite support from other literature, caution should be taken when interpreting Just et al\u2019s (2004) findings because of its low external validity. Only a small sample size was used, including only high functioning Caucasian individuals, meaning it cannot capture and account for the broad spectrum of ASD and the wider population. White matter (WM) is key for efficient and synchronised communication between brain regions, underpinning the foundation of brain connectivity (Dean et al., 2016). Research suggests atypical WM microstructure may account for the deficits seen in ASD. Bakhtiari et al (2012) assessed this in ASD participants compared to neurotypical (NT) individuals using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). It was found that ASD participants showed decreased fractional anisotropy values (FA), bilaterally spanning over a large brain region relative to controls, telling of maldevelopment in WM. These decreased FA values in ASD individuals correlated with social and communication difficulties, assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Regions displaying decreased FA in WM tracts included those implicated in emotional face processing (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus), language (inferior longitudinal fasciculus) and executive function (inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, which is linked to attention). A limitation of Bakhtiari et al\u2019s (2012) study is that participants were not screened for other neurological conditions i.e. schizophrenia and ADHD which have also been identified as showing abnormalities in WM, namely low FA relative to controls (Davenport et al., 2010). Furthermore, Bakhtiari et al\u2019s findings do not account for RRBs seen in ASD, with research suggesting an association between high FA values and RRBs (Cheung et al., 2009). This shows that the picture surrounding WM and the ASD behaviours is not completely clear yet and future research should seek to address this. To conclude abnormal brain connectivity appears to play an integral role in the profile of behaviours and differences in cognitive function seen in those with ASD. Underconnectivity theory arguably provides a robust account of language as well as ToM deficits seen in ASD (Just et al., 2004; Castelli et al., 2002). Meanwhile low FA values, indicative of WM disruption in ASD, can account for impairments in social and communication domains (Just et al., 2004). As mentioned above, DTI literature has also shown increased FA values corelating with RRBs seen in ASD (Cheung et al.,2009). Some researchers suggest atypical brain connectivity underpins the differences seen in ASD, going as far as to suggest it is the first firm finding in ASD research (see Hughes, 2007). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogenous neurological disorder, defined and diagnosed by the co-occurrence of impairments in communication, social interaction and the existence of restrictedrepetitive behaviours and interests in an individual (Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015). Some researchers suggest that ASD is a fractionable disorder (Happ\u00e9 et al., 2006). Those in support of fractionation argue that there is no single cause for the symptomology seen in ASD and it may be speculated that this is contributing to the \u2018lost generation\u2019 of ASD individuals (see Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015) whose needs may not be being met (Happ\u00e9, 2006). Evidence in support of fractionation theory, largely comes from research into the broader autism phenotype (BAP), defined as subclinical level of ASD symptoms within the general population, that exist outside of the threshold for an ASD diagnosis (Sasson et al., 2013). ASD is as a highly heritable disorder with estimates as high as 90% (Losh et al., 2009). This genetic liability has been shown by family research to translate in unaffected relatives of ASD individuals as milder, subclinical expressions of the triad, identifiable as the BAP (Losh et al., 2009). Losh et al\u2019s (2009) assessed the BAP in the parents of ASD diagnosed individuals (n=83) using a battery of well-established tasks, measuring ASD symptoms across the triad. Losh et al (2009) found that of the ASD parents, 22 were identified as positive for social BAP characteristics and 34 identified as positive for rigidperfectionist BAP characteristics. Parents demonstrating social BAP performed significantly less accurately relative to controls on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and similar results were observed across all 6 social cognition measures. However, this was not seen as plainly for tasks assessing executive function and central coherence. This demonstrates the validity of the BAP in parents of ASD individuals and suggest its componential nature, supporting the fractionation of the triad of impairments. However, Losh et al\u2019s research did not control for other disorders such as schizophrenia, which has been proven to have phenotypic similarities to ASD, that also impair social cognition (Sasson et al., 2007). Research seeking to replicate this study should pre-screen for such disorders that could affect ability in tasks, to confirm finding specificity to ASD. Low to moderate inter-corelations between the triad domains of impairment in ASD individuals has been outlined by researchers as evidence in favour of the fractionation theory (Happ\u00e9 et al., 2006). Conversely, Murray et al (2014) suggests this may be a product of range restriction, underestimating the inter-corelation between traits in those diagnosed. It is argued that studies use of clinical samples represents only the extremes of ASD symptoms because of simultaneous selection in diagnosis, therefore attenuating trait variance and its corelation with other variables. Testing this Murray et al (2014) used a simulation study of 10,000,000 cases showing impairments in all 3 domains, to replicate diagnosis and compared this with real population data from 236 non ASD participants and 148 participants diagnosed with high functioning ASD or Asperger\u2019s. Results showed significantly low inter-corelations between triad domains in the simulation study compared to the population study corelation. It was argued that this demonstrates the attenuation of inter-correlations between traits when simultaneous selection occurs. Murray suggest that investigations of ASD symptom inter-corelations should use both clinical samples and non-diagnosed participants, if we are to assume the characteristic of ASD exist on a continuum within the general population. This conversely suggests that using the general population can serve to facilitate the argument that ASD is a coherent, non-fractionable disorder. With this being said, the use of a simulation to reflect the ASD diagnosis process lacks ecological validity and cannot fully capture the character of the selection process in diagnosis, meaning cautions should be taken when drawing conclusions. Furthermore, this study is not reflective of the broad spectrum of ASD as only high-functioning individuals were sampled meaning it cannot account for low-functioning individuals. To conclude the BAP has been influential in identifying the genetic basis of ASD with a wealth of family-based research supporting this claim (Losh et al., 2009; Constantino &amp; Todd, 2005). However, it remains the case that no single gene can account for all aspects of triad, implying that they may be instead be symptom specific (Happ\u00e9 et al., 2006). Research with the general population and those displaying the BAP can also be used in support of ASD being a coherent disorder as suggested by Murray et al (2014). Future research should aim to control for simultaneous, clarifying triad symptom correlations.", "positive": ", Thank you for letting me know.

{"id": "aug_274", "anchor": "\"Hands up. Don\u2019t Shoot!\" \"End SARS!\" \"Go Green!!\" are just a few of the chant slogans many protesters all over the world use. The ample number of protests traversing disparate time zones has caught the attention of academics, critics and communities worldwide. In today\u2019s society, we are witnessing and experiencing is an upsurge of protest. Whether that is in America, Asia, Europe or Sub-Saharan Africa, each continent is living in an \u2018Age of Mass Protest\u2019. It is right to suggest that there have been recurring themes of inequality, repression and unrest partnered with many failed governments and politics that contribute to this increase. The frequency, scope and size of these protests are considered \u2018mass protests\u2019 that have essentially captured media attention, such as those in Britain, Nigeria and North America. Although each protest has a unique context and cause, the common grievances overwhelmingly draw on the opinions and viewpoints of feeble and ineffectual governance, nepotism and malfeasance. Thus, the essay will delve into the claim that indeed, we are living in an \u2018Age of Mass Protest\u2019 by analysing the root causes of the increase in global protests. These include inequality, corruption and environmental degradation. Social media will also be used to show how fast news spread which potentially could be the reason for a rise in mass protests. In addition, the essay will assess whether grievance theories may play a role in explaining a rise in mass protests by exploring the views of erudite scholars and academics of International Relations, who examine the impact of grievances on protest behaviours. Firstly, for us to understand and analyse the claim, the term \u2018mass protest\u2019 needs to be defined. According to Karl-Dieter Opp (2009), protest defines as a \"joint (i.e. collective) action of individuals aimed at achieving their goal or goals by influencing decisions of a target.\" The motive behind the collective action is \"to draw attention to the grievances; the action is further meant to provoke ameliorative steps by some target group\" (Turner, 1969). Although both definitions are coherent, they fail to deeply define large-scale protests. Ergo, the word \u2018mass\u2019 has been added to disclose that the action is carried out by an extensive caucus of citizens. With its causes ranging from basic human rights to economic social injustice to impoverished government and corruption, the term \u2018protest\u2019 is an \u2018umbrella\u2019 term for many various forms of expression. Whether a protest takes the form of a petition (passive protest) or a boycott (direct protest), the sea of protests the world has witnessed leads us to question why mass protests are increasing in frequency. We must understand the catalyst behind mass protests in order to mitigate their effects on the rest of the world. The most evident and plausible explanation for the increase in mass protests would be economic and social inequality. The World Bank (2012) believes that \"Inequality and inequity remain the global genesis of poverty and relative deprivation,\" which further addresses that \"they are the reasons why social movements commence to rebel against unresolved generational disparities and societal injustices\" (Pridemore, 2008). Pridemore\u2019s perspective can be exemplified in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Many within the movement have protested because of the scarcity or denied quality of life aspects (i.e., education, employment, healthcare, housing etc.). In addition, they have been vocal at raising awareness for the social injustice and systemic racism they face when seeing the devaluation of African American lives. The creation of the movement was influenced after George Zimmerman\u2019s acquittal in the shooting death of African American teen, Trayvon Martin in February 2012. Since its founding, the movement has flourished and gained attention from many around the world who have started social justice protests of their own. This is due to social media\u2019s input which has \"engaged global audiences at unprecedented speed\" (Foer, 2017). The highly publicised murders by police enforcement of Eric Garner (2014), Philando Castile (2016), Sandra Bland (2015) etc. and more recently, George Floyd (2020) stand testament to this. Since the death of Floyd in May 2020, ACLED have recorded over 7,750 demonstrations and protests linked to the BLM movement, across all 50 states in America, as well as other countries, such as the UK. From this statistic, it is right to suggest that we are living in an \u2018Age of Mass Protest\u2019 as in this case, the lives of African Americans are being deprived of social justice and racial equality. Hence why deprived individuals within this movement will be more likely to lead to certain protest behaviours. Many theorists such as Klandermans (1997) and Useem (1998) have conflicting definitions of deprivation, but Gurney and Tierney\u2019s (1982) definition is apt in this discussion of social movements. They define it as \"the combination of emotional frustrations and social inequality perceptions that prevent an individual, group or community to thrive within the mainstream societal context\". Their definition puts particular focus on the difference between experienced reality and what is to be expected. In the same way, BLM protesters want economic and social equality but have received the opposite. Many researchers and theorists have invoked the grievance theory, Relative Deprivation (RD) to explain the phenomena of participating in mass protests and how they interact with deprivation to enhance the protest potential of grievances. For example, Eversley et al. (2017) applies the theoretical framework of the RD theory to explain why inequality and RD incites the BLM movement to protest. In her article, she provides commentary on the four stages of social movements-emergence, coalescence, bureaucratization and decline to highlight BLM\u2019s social movement life cycle. Paying close attention to Eversley\u2019s perception of coalescence (second) stage, in particular, she asserts that BLM use communal and collective action to broadly promote the social injustices endured and establish other coalitions to further protest the movement\u2019s concerns and demands. Her assertion supports the claim as she uses the concept of coalescence to highlight how BLM\u2019s tactics are strategically used which has broadened the movement \u2018far beyond its core support\u2019. More importantly what is evident in her argument is that RD plays a role in explaining collective action and thus spurs mass protest. The application to relative deprivation theory further highlights that \"for many Blacks, poverty and relative deprivation are the impetuses why Blacks mobilize to collectively protest against the societal injustices targeted against them\" (Adler, 2015). Correspondingly, Nigeria\u2019s deprivation of social justice, which is caused by their corrupt governance of state, is another important factor to assess when analysing whether we are living in an \u2018Age of Mass Protest\u2019. Runciman\u2019s development of RD (1966) can be employed to explain Nigeria\u2019s cause of mass protests. Runciman uses the concept of social justice centered around RD, to argue that there is a sense of dissatisfaction people feel when they observe other people having something they desire, which is within their grasp but insurmountable. His theory focuses on four criteria for RD. Nonetheless, his first condition promotes that Person A does not have X \u2013 hence why Person A may feel deprived and feel the need to protest. This viewpoint is highly fitting and relatable to the #EndSars movement, as Nigerians feel a disconnect to social justice. Nigeria\u2019s lack of capacity in terms of the attainment of effective governance that addresses the issues of corruption and human rights for example is generally traced to leadership failure (Achebe, 1988). In light of this, the feeble governance that is portrayed in many developing countries is at large and thrives in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the Economist report, data displays that mass protests have increased annually by an average of 11.5 percent from 2009 to 2019 across all regions of the world, with the fastest growth in sub-Saharan Africa (23.8% global average per year increase). This data is significant as it suggests that the number and intensity of African mass protests have inflated, which reflects \"pre-existing frustrations with social and political conditions that have now been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 restrictions\" (Ramdeen, 2020). For Nigeria, as of recently, their frustrations lie within the government\u2019s incompetence and lack of accountability. As of October 2020, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) caused an outbreak of mass protests. Established in 1992, the purpose of the squad was to combat against armed robbers becoming rampant. However, SARS became controversial after abusing their power by unlawfully killing, harassing, kidnapping, and extorting money from young individuals, leaving them deprived of good governance. In application to Runciman\u2019s first condition, he exemplifies that deprived individuals, in times of crisis, are likely to demonstrate specific protest behaviours. Despite Runciman\u2019s insight, it could be argued that his theory fails to analyse why some people who are also affected by the cause, fail to act and join social movements in active engagement. From a different viewpoint, deprivation can reduce protest engagement. This is supported by Thomas Kurer (2019), who believes that the decline of citizens\u2019 economic grievances can affect their inclination to protest, however those who experience more deterioration than others may want to mobilise more politically. To some extent, relative deprivation can spur mass engagement in protest activism, however this depends on how much an individual has endured. This can be supported by the idea that there are more youth igniting these mass protests. It is therefore right to suggest that mass protests are thriving in a country where humanity is still relatively youthful and social media is used as an outlet to express their grievances. Social media\u2019s contribution has encouraged countries, such as the UK, to create their own mass protests, shedding their grievances on the issue as well. Their impact accentuates that \"Social media is a way of the voiceless and those that cannot help physically express themselves\" (Wilding et. al, 2018). The inference to be drawn from this is the Nigerian government\u2019s abuse of power coupled with how social media has been used to transmit news across the world, resulting in an uproar of protests. By the same token, the need for reform in climate change is a motivation behind a rise in mass protests. The Extinction Rebellion (XR) movement in the UK attempt to pursue their goal of compelling action to tackle environmental issues and sought to address the problems of unresponsive government. Arguably, they are deprived of receptive government and thus use direct action tactics (such as collectively blockading bridges and chaining themselves to buildings) to disseminate their views. This is supported by XR\u2019s co- founder, Roger Hallam who argues that \"mass civil disobedience is our only option.\" In a globalized society, the global problem of climate change will not be solved by individual states or even international organizations (Doolen, 2020), hence the need for collective action. Thus, using the theoretical scaffold of Collective Action (CA) Theory (Olson, 1965) can provide reasons as to why there are mass XR protests. Evidently, CA is a powerful motivational push to protest as it encourages participation. This is reinforced by Hayes* (2020) who says that \"Extinction Rebellion seems to have succeeded in mobilising new people.\" \u2018Collective identification intensifies feelings of efficacy\u2019 (Simon et. al, 1998). Simon\u2019s notion adds value to the argument as it justifies how effective XR\u2019s active participation has become at garnering media attention. Additionally, the proliferation of social media, despite its offline participation, corresponds with the Habermasian criteria of high accessibility and relatively unrestricted ability to confer (Habermas, 1989). It has generated a \u2018global diffusion\u2019 (Della Porta, 2017). This is exemplified in the copious number of environmental protests occurring worldwide - Spain, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden- where the nation\u2019s sensation, Greta Thunberg campaigns for ecological change. To summarise, the XR protests have resulted in an uproar of protests due to their collective action and deprivation of responsive governments. The grievances felt from XR protesters portray how the principles and values they place highly are being violated. Recently, mass protests have become numerous and geographically widespread. Protests have become an escalated global trend and continue to play a role in shaping the political landscape and determining the next cultural, economic, and social decisions. With many notable frustrations around the world currently, effective social media platforms have proven to increase the spread of mass protests. This essay has attempted to critically assess the common causes and themes that arise which garners a reaction and then essentially a protest. The grievance theory discussed has provided valid reason as to why BLM, #EndSars and XR are protesting in masses.", "positive": "se I only remember buying some yellow trousers that to this day I STILL haven\u2019t worn That\u2019s the thing I\u2019m not saving it for any thing It\u2019s just not in right now \ud83d\ude02 Plus I got Uber all the way to to avoid that It\u2019s too bright- It gives me like weddings and summer formal vibes Hey , I\u2019m doing well thanks, hope you are too When are you guys planning to go back to uni?

{"id": "aug_279", "anchor": "Deductive reasoning is a top-down way of logical thinking which allows us to draw conclusions with certainty from facts we know or assume to be true by testing an existing theory. It is an argument including 2 premises and one conclusion without increasing semantic knowledge. An example for this would be \"All cats have fur. Fur is soft. Therefore, cats are soft\". The 2 premises here, are confirming the conclusion. Deductive reasoning holds strength (certainty and validity) whilst inductive reasoning depends on the certainty or strength of evidence. However, deductive reasoning can only be true is all premises are true and term are clear. In contrast, Inductive reasoning is an inferential process that expands knowledge on the face of uncertainty (Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett &amp; Thagard, 1986: p. 1). Inductive reasoning increases semantic knowledge which is used in 2 ways. Specific induction is a type of induction which generates explanations based on their background knowledge and therefore, create hypothesis. For example, if the kettle were shut, one would turn the switch on to start the kettle, from its worldly knowledge. However, general induction Is descriptive, it searches for an explanation via testing the hypothesis. For example, \"All kettles I have come across are electrical\" in which one would have to do research about to falsify it. In both examples, the conclusion can be proved wrong, as automatic kettles also exist. However, inductive reasoning can never be fully proven, it can only be invalidated. Regardless of all the differences between the two, they both happen work together in experimental projects. Scientists tend to start of their studies by inductive reasoning whereby they first develop a theory. Following up, deductive reasoning is combined into the project in order to confirm or invalidate the conclusion.", "positive": "Hotel Indigo; Based in Bulevardi (26), Helsinki Finland.

{"id": "aug_281", "anchor": "This strategy paper will focus on suggesting realistic solutions to the problem of educational gender inequality in India. This inequality is a clear problem; unequal access to education is an infringement of human rights. If this gender disparity was lessened, the well-being and development of children would be positively impacted, as well as the economy of the country itself (Fuller, 2019). To tackle this issue, proposed strategies could take the form of implementing new legislative reforms that aid families in the struggles they face, as well as reforming teaching throughout India in order to help eradicate damaging cultural and social norms. The paper will begin by firstly explaining the main problems within the education sector in India and will then highlight the importance of achieving gender equality in education. The main body of the paper will entail a detailed analysis of the current strategies and legislation in place as well as non-governmental reforms made by different organisations. The paper will then move towards a focus on the suggested strategies that could be incorporated into the current education system to alleviate gender inequalities and will be compared to the successes of educational reform in Sweden. This will include a description of the targets for the reforms, instruments to aid reform, and the target groups at which reforms are aimed at. The paper will conclude with a summary of the findings from this research and ways to ensure the successful implementation of new strategies. Why is this a problem? There are two primary factors that can limit the education of girls in India: cultural traditions and poverty. In terms of cultural traditions, there are several reasons that this issue can play a significant role in the educational disparity between genders. Firstly, the miseducation of parents about the importance of schools for girls and the costings of education itself thus leads to families becoming reluctant to educate girls within the household. Research shows that parents are more willing to send their girls to school if they had access to more information about school (Maertens, 2011). Furthermore, it is said that gender discrimination within household expenditure and education has resulted in the inadequate progress of educating of women in many countries across the world, and thus ingrains this issue into the societal framework of such countries (Saha, 2013). This is also reinforced by the low literacy rates in India. The correlation between low literacy rates among men and women indicates that the miseducation of parents can affect the education of girls because they themselves have had inadequate education, and it is difficult for them to understand the importance of it, further highlighting the gender inequalities between men and women through previous social norms. For example, the 2011 literacy rates of women were 57.93% compared to men which were 77.15% (Pathania, 2020) demonstrating gender disparities and how poverty can be a factor in gender inequalities within education. Poverty plays an important role in the lack of education for girls. Daughters from families that face social pressures to get married are more likely to only complete minimum education, as shown in a study of three rural villages in India, where only 39% of girls were allowed by their parents to pursue higher education, compared to the 71% of boys who would go into further education (Maertens, 2013). Furthermore, educating women is not prioritised in the household as it stops the income that would otherwise be earned from girls going straight into work rather than staying in school. Therefore, working and earning can be seen to be put on a pedestal instead for the many families facing financial difficulties (Hebert, 2020). Why is this an important issue for gender equality? As UNICEF has stated, the educational advancement of girls is the most effective way of combatting challenges to human development, so it is important to expand educational access and overcome cultural norms to achieve this (Ross, Shah &amp; Wang, 2011). Inequalities within education are important to the issue of gender equality, as even though India emerges as one of the top three countries for higher education (Bazaz &amp; Akram, 2020), in certain states such as Uttar Pradesh, only 33.20% of women are educated compared to the 73.40% of men who are educated, highlighting that there are severe problems within the education system that disadvantage women. Furthermore, this can lead to other problems such as a gender gap in the labour market, as if employers value a woman\u2019s education less than that of a man\u2019s, and therefore there are fewer economic incentives to educate women, which subsequently affects the economy and the wellbeing of women (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Another factor that makes this issue important is that the education of girls further reduces the risks they face, such as abuse and child marriage, as currently, a third of child brides worldwide are in India (Sahni, 2018). Moreover, better education for girls reduces the risks of child labour in poorer families to ensure the survival of their households, as the hourly wages of a child with higher school education are 8.97% higher compared to a child with no schooling, leading to less exploitation (Chamarbagwala, 2008). Attempted strategies to achieve gender equality in education There have been many attempts in India to close the gender gaps in education, through both legal and social means. The main legislative reform introduced was the Right to Education Act in 2009, in which, all children between 6 and 14 years of age are required to complete primary school education. This reform has proven successful as enrolment between 2013-14 increased from 43.8% to 48.2% (Sahni, 2018). However, its success still proves limited on the gender equality front as a UNESCO report detailed that of the 95% of children who attended primary school, only 40% continued onto secondary education, in which, a small fraction of the 40% were girls (Modi, 2017). Attempts have also been made to reform the curriculum. However, this failed due to the response of disadvantaged schools towards the issue of gender equality: an attempt was made to create a new system where boys of different abilities were paired with girls, but this meant the educational interests of girls were sacrificed, therefore showing little to no development in changing gender inequalities in schools (Charlton, 2007). Secondly, a non-legislative reform that was made to combat gender inequality in education was the KGBV programme introduced in 2004. The goal of the programme was to increase children\u2019s, and in particular girls, access to the curriculum and to improve teaching standards. This began successfully as two Indian states partnered with CARE India (a non-governmental organisation) to introduce KGBV schools that were single-sex and employ a non-traditional curriculum. The KGBV school initiative was shown to be successful as they were more inclusive than state schools, as children of all castes could attend, which also allowed the new schools challenged harmful social norms. However, the success was limited as the KGBV programme did not focus on education above seventh grade where school dropout rates for girls are the highest (Shah, 2015). Finally, the most successful attempt at improving gender inequality in education was by ANK, a non-profit organisation with an aim to empower girls. ANK set up in 10 rural villages and introduced several initiatives for girls including: bicycle banks in 2002 to improve access to schools for girls, a life skills education programme out of school hours, a scholarship programme, and a karate programme. The implementation of these programmes showed great promise as 1,100 girls achieved a scholarship and 1,000 girls were given access to bikes. It was found that the combination of the bicycle bank and the life skills education programme led to the best education outcomes for girls. However, the bicycle bank programme was discontinued and this programme only reached a small number of girls, so, nationally, gender disparities remained high (Modi, 2017). Proposed Strategies My first proposed strategy is to subsidise costs for school by 50% for low-income families; as mentioned above, many parents selectively choose their male children to attend school rather than their female children, because of financial difficulties. Therefore, subsidising the costs of schooling can enable equal opportunities for girls. This has proved successful in countries such as Sweden, where pre-schooling costs have been subsidised for lower-income families, in order to equalise opportunities for all and ensure substantial educational attainment for both males and females (Bjorklund, Clark, Edin, Fredricksson &amp; Krueger, 2006). Success can be seen clearly when compared to India, a large 79% of the students go on to secondary school in Sweden (European Commission, 2017) against a mere 40% in India, in which, the ratio of boys to girls is equal in Sweden unlike in India (Modi, 2017). Additionally, another legislative reform that could be introduced is to improve families\u2019 access to daycare and after school care, so that parents can work, alleviating any stresses on children providing additional household income. A similar policy proved successful in Sweden (Sweden, 2020), in which a right to daycare was introduced in the 1990s for working parents to alleviate financial pressure (Fritzell, Hvinden, Kautto, Kvist &amp; Uusitalo, 2001). Furthermore, there has been evidence to suggest that altering the way teachers are trained helps to promote gender equality and eradicate bias in the classroom. In a proposed system called REFLECT, teachers are given criteria that they must meet, including creating a suitable learning environment for female and male children - this could prove beneficial in India (Kollmayer, 2020). The next proposed strategy is an extension of the work of ANK with the bicycle banks and life skills education programme (Modi, 2017) as it proved successful but stopped due to a lack of funding. This would enable a focus on the education of girls and give them access to adequate teaching, which in turn reaps enormous benefits economically, socially, and mentally, especially in terms of the wellbeing of girls in India. It would also help to elevate the goal of India to become more gender-inclusive, as currently, their progress for gender equality remains slow and they stand at a ranking of 132 out of 187 countries (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Sequentially, to enable parents of girls to realise the importance of education, it is vital to recruit them as allies in the movement against gender inequalities in education. To do this, parents\u2019 evenings could be introduced for teachers to educate parents in schooling and other matters that put girls at risk such as child marriage. Research shows that parents evenings are important in the development of a child and important for the parents themselves as they are responsible for making key decisions that impact the future of their children (Fefer, 2020), highlighting how this can also be a way to communicate the positive prospects for girls with the aid of education. To conclude, it is prevalent that actions must be taken within education legislation and within the households of girls to combat the problem of gender inequality within education. The government must take steps to support families of lower incomes so as to ensure no one is denied equal opportunity to education. This will reduce child labour rates, increase literacy rates, and improve India\u2019s ranking on the gender equality index, as well as increasing the economic status of many civilians in India. With the increased education of girls, it will help to combat harmful social norms in the future, preventing young girls from the fate of child marriage, abuse, and exploitation. With reforms in teaching, they could allow for long-lasting changes within education, as it means they can be the main drivers for change within schools. This, combined with the added aid of regular parents\u2019 evenings, allows for teachers to become catalysts in changing negative social attitudes towards gender equality concerns that strategies like these will remain only partially effective. For example, India was one of 52 countries that refused to comply with Article 5 of the UN sustainable development goals which states that \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" (United Nations, 2020). Without the support of the government, gender equality may not be valued. However, this can be counteracted by the implementation and enforcement of new laws, starting within the education sector, to allow women and young girls to become more independent and assert themselves within society.", "positive": "h im really excited for it!!

Kind RegardsBeste Gr\u00fc\u00dfe Hi , I went to and I was supposed to do 1 semester but loved it so much that I ended up doing 2! Accommodation in was cheap. If you live in the student accommodation there, which has been newly renovated i think I paid 275 euros a month including bills. You also get a free trainbus pass when you enrol at which saves a lot of costs when travelling around (if you want more info about this let me know). Food was expensive but I just budgeted myself and managed okay so don't worry too much about that. I saw a lot of benefits when I did my placement at - my language skills improved so much (english and ), I became way more confident socially and in my academic skills, I became even more independent and now literally feel like I can do anything. Drawbacks I would say are it can be quite hard at first being away from home but just throw yourself into it and you'll be fine, as mostly everyone speaks english. There aren't as much of a variety of English courses at the University. However, I took a few modules in English that I really enjoyed, so just try anything. The workload was okay. , in general, are a lot more intense with workload but don't feel overwhelmed as you only had to get a pass to get the credits for that course. The assessments were all okay too - if you speak to the lecturers they generally are willing to make the assessments easier for you. I didn't actually know anyone from who was going to .

{"id": "aug_287", "anchor": "Assess the performance of any President of the United States in the context of the respective period in which they held the office. Unlike many American presidents, the significance of his time in office; his character, values, convictions, and affinities combined with the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the period of his presidency, made his term of significant importance to historians and not his personality and they all agree he had a huge input in the tensions leading up to the Civil War, but historians continue to debate whether the Civil War that occurred right after his administration was inevitable or not (Smith, 2002). This essay is divided into several parts: The first part will explain Buchanan early life, the second part was his congressional and diplomatic career, the third part covers the \u2018Bleeding Kansas\u2019 and Dred case, the fourth part will assess the North and South slavery divide and then the last part will conclude assessing the performance of any President of the United States in the context of the respective period in which they held the office. Early life: James Buchanan was born to James and Elizabeth Speer Buchanan Sr., immigrants from Ireland. Buchanan was born two years into George Washington\u2019s presidency in 1791 and born in a log cabin, unlike many log cabins births, Buchannan\u2019s father was a successful merchant and could provide for 11 children. As the first-born eldest son, he was especially favoured and had the privilege of attending Dickenson college, in a time when very few American men went to college, putting him in a favourable platform for success and was able to then apprentice at a law office (Baker, 2004). He studied law at a time where there were only three law schools in the U.S and after being admitted to the bar in 1812, opened his law practice. Soon afterward he enlisted in the military due to a War occurring in 1812 between the U.S and the UK, Ireland, and its dependent colonies and allies in North America (Baker, 2004). Congressional and diplomatic career: Buchanan used to be a lawyer until he switched to politics and was successful due to his oratory skills. Buchanan successfully ran for the U.S. Place of Representatives in 1820 and turned into an ardent ally for Andrew Jackson the seventh leader of America and even coordinated volunteer supporters for Andrew Jackson who founded the new Democratic party (Smith, 1975). Moreover, in Washington, he was close with numerous Southern Congressmen and saw some New England Congressmen as concerning revolutionaries (Baker, 2004). He was delegated to the Committee of Agriculture in his first year, and he in the end became Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary and declined nomination again to a 6th term, and momentarily got back to private life (Baker, 2004). After Jackson was reappointed in 1832, he offered Buchanan the situation of United States Ambassador to Russia. Buchanan was hesitant to leave the nation at the end of the day originally agreed. He filled in as ambassador for a year and a half, during which time he learned French, which is the lingua franca of trade during the 19th century and later went on to arrange business and oceanic settlements with the Russian Empire (Baker, 2004). Kansas bleeding: \u2018The Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 reopened the stipulated query over state-wide slavery (Mometrix, 2021). \u2018The Act drafted these new territories to expedite transcontinental railroad, the connection would bring up tension over the legality of transcontinental slavery and tension between pro-and anti-slavery activists both seeking to pass a constitution\u2019 (Khan Academy, 2020). The faith of Kansas located in the mid-west becoming either a freed state or a slave state has reached boiling point (Mometrix, 2021). Border ruffians helped to secure a proslavery legislature in Kansas, which drafted a proslavery constitution known as the Lecompton Constitution. Meanwhile, anti-slavery activists established an extra-legal regime of their own based in Topeka. The political and ideological disputes over the Kansas- Nebraska Act opened bloodshed for 5 year and polluted the endorsers' Pierce and Douglas Democratic candidate campaign, allowing a perfect campaign run for Buchanan\u2019 (Khan Academy, 2020). \u2018Buchanan took a conventional presidential campaigning approach: making no public appearances and very few press statements, choosing to leave his campaign to his supporters named \u2018Buchaneers\u2019; Fremont did the same whereas budding Republican Lincoln campaigned heavily\u2019 (Cooper, 2020). Nevertheless, after coming into office, Buchanan directed Kansas to be a slave state to try put an end to bleeding Kansas\u2019 infighting (Khan Academy, 2020). Subsequently, Buchanan was given the nickname \"doughface\" by critics because he was a staunch conservative similar to Southern politicians; whilst himself being from the North. Buchanan saw that the Democratic Party's survival depended on the continuation of the slave-driven economy of the South and learned from William R. King the political importance of enabling the' peculiar institution' to continue unchecked and both were against abolitionists\u2019 (Balcerski, 2019). After being reluctant to overrule the Southern secession in 1860 \u2013 1861, this nickname was popularised in the country especially in the North\u2019 (Balcerski, 2019). Unlike Fremont who wanted to outlaw slavery, Buchanan assured Americans slavery laws now and, in the future, will be determined by states independently; this catering allowed him to gain support from both South and passive North supporters (Cooper, 2020). Moreover, Buchanan became more and more dogmatic and failed to interpret the nation\u2019, in all of his actions, Buchanan was Pro Southern and supported the Southern side, doing the same in Kansas by supporting Kansas constitute written by Southern pro settlers and not the constitution Northern pro settlers government; shocking the Northern states and politicians and constantly called Northerner's extremists and made outlandish remarks that Northerners were supporting black rapists (Cooper, 2020). Dred case: Another event we could use to assess Buchanan's performance as a president was the Dred Scott Case. Buchanan supported the supreme court ruling for the \u20181857 Dred Scott case\u2019, where an African American man tried to sue his owners on behalf of himself, his wife, and two daughters freedom; arguing that after their owners took them to \"free\" U.S territory where slavery was illegal, that they were no longer slaves, even when they went back to states where slavery was legal (Baker, 2004). Buchanan encouraged a Northerner in the supreme court to side with the South in the \u2018Dred Scott case\u2019, which essentially nationalised slavery across states where slavery was legal or illegal (Baker, 2004). The Supreme Court ruled that the US constitution is not a constitution made to rule over African Americans and they are not citizens with rights and dismissed the case; the decision for this comes out just days after Buchanan is inaugurated (Baker, 2004). This ruling was celebrated in the South, but infuriated the North, further marginalising and alienating the North from Buchanan and Southern leaning government institutions (WH GOV, 2006). A few days later the \u2018Dred case \u2018 Chief clarified his ruling stating, \"Congress had no constitutional power to deprive persons of their property rights in slaves in the territories\" (Russel, 1966). Buchanan Campaign: Finally, after 40 years of public service, the democratic party agrees to throw its full weight behind the 65-year-old Buchanan. Buchanan took advantage of the fact that he had been out of the country, as an ambassador in London, and so had not been involved politically in the slavery debate, meaning he did not have any strong opposition or negative public sentiment (WH GOV, 2006). Alas after 4 centuries, James Buchanan was elected to the American presidential office as the 15th president during the years 1857 \u2013 1861, with much significance as the first native-born Pennsylvanian to serve as president and would remain the only native-born Pennsylvanian to be elected president until Joe Biden (WH GOV, 2006). Howbeit to assumptions, the Electoral College seems to show Buchanan seemingly having won with comfort; however, the truth was far from this, although Buchanan is a North native, he won in only four of fourteen Northern states and narrowly avoided loss in his native Pennsylvania. Moreover, his election run was littered with widespread suspicions, one of the most popular rumours being that the Democratic party was able to pass the narrow winning margin with fraudulent payoffs however, this is all allegations and contented (Cooper, 2020). Furthermore, as it was a three-way race, Buchanan was able to win with less than half the popular vote mandate (Cooper, 2020). In a nation sharply divided over slavery and rising sectionalism, his base support was from the South, though Buchanan could not claim anything close to a popular mandate (Cooper, 2020). Although Buchanan sought presidential office for years, he had profound concerns over this potential responsibility, stating: \"I had hoped for the nomination in 1844, again in 1848, and even in 1852, but now I would hesitate to take it. Before many years, the abolitionists will bring war upon this land. It may come during the next presidential term\" (Cooper, 2020). Foreign affairs: To extend on assessing Buchanan's presidential office term, this time on his foreign relations. Buchanan was reluctant to pursue an active foreign policy because of the sectional crisis and danger of civil war in the United States (Cooper, 2020). Virtually all of his foreign policy was focused on strengthening the U.S. presence in countries to the South. \"In 1858, he told Congress, \"It is, without doubt, our race's fate to extend across the continent of North America\" (Cooper, 2020). His foreign policy remained focused on the Caribbean, an area he had dealt with while serving under Franklin Pierce as ambassador to England; as president, he did not give up on his dreams of annexing Cuba, but these ambitions were doomed by continuing Republican resistance (Cooper, 2020). Buchanan deployed naval forces on many occasions to intimidate Britain and to curb their presence and authority in Central America and to impose American sovereignty over Central America; after a few passive threats, the British succumbed to the pressure put on them by Buchannan (Cooper, 2020). I believe as Birkner stated that Buchanan should be credited with strengthening relations with the UK, this feat was significant as Buchanan pulled this off during a period of frosty relations after the War of 1812 (National Constitution Center, 2017). Furthermore, Buchanan was seeking to create a military protectorate in Mexico to threaten and bully Latin America however, a further potential confrontation was avoided by congressional outrage and preoccupation over mainland conflict and Congressman did not approve any funding or support for any of Buchannan\u2019s central American military wishes (Cooper, 2020). He did however get reparations from several Central and South American states over the damage they caused to American property and though the requested Mexican transit rights were denied, he did win Nicaraguans (Cooper, 2020). North and South economic slave divide: Most in the North were willing to accept slavery where it already existed, typically occurring in states that practiced extreme forms of racial oppression but would not accept the risk that slavery would expand into new areas where slavery was illegal or not present; the normalisation of slavery would gain moral public approval and might led to legal recognition into these new areas (Seidule, 2020). A lot of Southern politicians, whether or not any practical gain was involved, would not settle to give into Northern demands and indeed craved to have their demands over slavery heard; the denial of equal rights was, on the other hand, a moral rejection and a challenge to the self-esteem of a proud and sensitive person to Northerners (Seidule, 2020). Following this, many Northerners feared that the South was seeking not only to extend slavery to the west, but also to the Northern states and many Southerners feared that the first step towards complete abolition was the restriction of slavery in such remote places as Oregon and New Mexico; but both views were wrong, and an quick thinking president capable of recognising the situation and the emotions of each parties could have significantly contributed to sectional peace, instead of leaving this different in morals to brew (Smith, 2002). Buchanan's main objective was peace, but his predilections to Southern politicians whilst neglecting fellow Northerners make his dream unlikely (Seidule, 2020). The North and South had very different moral and economic model systems adopted, the South kept an agrarian economy which was strictly \u2018traditional American\u2019, 23rds of the South livelihood was on farms and plantation sites, thought the vast majority did not own slaves, whereas the North emulated Europe\u2019s industrial revolution and was driven by employing cheap immigrant workers (Baker, 2004). Consequently, the North's main business interest was to increase tax % on European products imports, so that the other states, including the South, would buy more of their domestic products and grow the new economic system (Baker, 2004). This a huge faultline point of tension, the North thus had much more \u2018Capital\u2019 than the South, in terms of factories and infrastructure, however, the South believed their slaves to be property as a form of \u2018Capital\u2019 and not \u2018Labour\u2019; they wanted their capital to be mobile and wanted to take their slaves (wealth) across the Americas to be able to: carry their wealth across states, expand their market to trade or sell their slaves to slaveholding states and most importantly they would have more of a political constituency for the types of economic policies that would be Pro-Southern (Quist and Birkner, 2013: (American Battlefield Trust, 2020). The Southern economy was starting to stagnant and some areas were going through recessions despite this, the Northern economy was booming (American Battlefield Trust, 2020). Furthermore, in the first year of Buchannan\u2019s presidency, there is an economic recession due to a monopoly insurance company failing, masses of business\u2019 file for bankrupt, the economy was left volatile and would take U.S. several years to recover (Quist and Birkner, 2013). The economy was left volatile during the 1800s, as unlike today there was no federal reserve to help stabilise the economy back then and it was unrealistic to expect the federal government in the 1800s to buy its way out of a demand shortfall (Quist and Birkner, 2013). By the time Buchannan leaves office, the population in America was just over 30 million, growing 25% during the period between 1850-1860 because of German and Irish immigrants going to work in the industrial and economic booming North (Khan Academy, 2016). Initially, due to differing political and business model interests, the North invested in railroad and roads connecting states that are at all navigable, whilst the South did not (Quist and Birkner, 2013). There were more men per capita in the South signing up to fight, but due to the huge wave of immigration in the North, they had more men who could fight, more wealth, and more resources available by the end of Buchannan\u2019s term, which left the North with a huge advantage to win the Civil war (Smith, 1975). It is clear to see how Buchannan\u2019s Southern close relationship escalated the sectional rivalry between the North and South after analysing the significant events in the presidency of Buchanan and the North was always expected to yield to South requests (Quist and Birkner, 2013). Presiding the Civil war, I believe Buchanan gaslighting and giving platform and legitimacy to these Southern requests to rule over the whole country, whilst blaming regional tensions solely on Northern abolitionists (Quist and Birkner, 2013). Evidently, Buchanan was given to lead over an increasingly fractured country and could not adequately grapple with the contemporised political reality of the United States; Buchanan continuance to yield to Southern demands and pleasing his Southern citizens, but Buchanan failed to contemplate that the North would not yield to these same demands and constitutions favouring Southern interests (WH GOV, 2006). He inadequately failed to also identify the rise of sectionalism and divide in American political parties, alas leading to Republicans winning every free state in the North by 1860, shunning abolitionists in society, the Whigs party collapsed, and also fragmented Democrats in the North into two parties (Smith, 1975). This lack of interest was proven during Buchannan\u2019s inauguration where he was asked about the rising regional tensions, he said it was \"happily, a matter of but little practical importance\" since the Supreme Court could \"speedily and finally\" settle it (Histclo, 2016). Contrastingly to assumptions, Buchanan was not for any state succession and wrote a message to Congress in 1860, stating that he believes that succession is illegal, but that the federal government should not be legally allowed to stop succession if it occurs (McNamara, 2019). This ambiguous message by an influential figure was noticeably unpopular with both sides, Southerners were displeased to find out Buchanan believed secession to be illegal and Northerners were bewildered by his belief the federal government should not stop illegal succession and for the rest of his term, Buchanan retreated to his silence on any policy (McNamara, 2019). Following this, when the states, later on, made succession documents where every state voted overwhelmingly to succeed in every Southern state (Seidule, 2020); right before Buchanan officially leaves the presidency, he said to Lincoln, \u2018If you are as happy my dear Sir as entering this house as I am leaving it and returning home, you are the happiest man in the country\" (Balcerski, 2019) For this case, the single most crucial reason for the War by both parties, all classes and both North and South by a long mile was slavery, a South Carolina newspaper cautioned well before the 1860 presidential election that, \"the potential abolition of slavery was a most important issue and individuals who didn\u2019t want to \"surrender the slavery institution\" needed to take measure to defend it (Seidule, 2020). Due to \u2018Bleeding Kansas\u2019, \u2018Dred Scott\u2019, \u2018Economic Recession\u2019 and political party sectionalism by the end of his first term in 1860, it becomes increasingly evident Buchanan was not going to be a candidate for re-election (National Constitution Center, 2020). A poll in 1948 garnered interest after polling 55 reputable historians on their subjective opinion to rank the presidential performance, in addition to several newer polls such as Siena Poll 2010 and Buchanan was consistently ranked in the bottom three; historians referred to him as weak and Finkelman suggested that his lack of interest to draft policies to unite the country, showed his lack of preparedness to tackle the forecasted war (National Constitution Center, 2020). Conclusion: To conclude, I believe Buchanan did try to as a president seek to preserve harmony within the government by trying to keep the country in the past, but tensions only increased after his plan to solve sectionalism and balance sides was to keep society the same (WH GOV, 2006). This however would not be interpreted as a balance and Buchannan had already been rendered irrepressible and unresponsive to resolution by his pro-Southern behaviours (Smith, 1975). Furthermore, South Carolina seceded in 1860 after Lincoln was elected to replace Buchanan, and the Confederacy was soon formed. The American Civil War (1861-1865) began a month after Buchanan left office (Cooper, 2020). Despite \u2018historians and commentators of the 21st century criticising Buchanan for not addressing slavery disputes head on or critiquing him for the several states that succeed during his presidential reign and considering him as the worst American president\u2019 (House et al., 1990). Many scholars such as Ken Stampp and Robert Johannsen say the Buchannan\u2019s North and South segregation calamity is Buchannan\u2019s best moment and suggested that he approached the situation in the same way that Lincoln did, but due to environmental difficulties, there was a limit to his influence (Quist and Birkner, 2013). Buchanan seems to have been a president thrown into an already fractured country, where existing issues between the free North and the slave South escalated into non-manageable levels; there were two uncompromising regions acting as two countries with two distinct cultures leaving modern-day cultural remnants.", "positive": "d afternoon, could you help me with any internship opportunities for me related to any foreign office, government, local council, or anything related to the government and I had a talk with someone from the university who told me that there are some opportunities that can be done online, because I can only have opportunities located in .

{"id": "aug_297", "anchor": "Employment relations is a process of socio-economic exchange, and involves a individual performing service or duty in exchange for payment. Employment relations looks at the different aspects of a relationship between an employee and its employer. Employment relations have a major impact on the UK labour market, this statement is supported by ONS report on the UK labour market which shows from November 2017, there are approximately 32 million people at work with more than half being employed. The UK government is crucial with regards to employment relations to ensure they are able to meet the key goals of the country. The government acts as the economic manager, this consist of setting the level of wages, tax rate and managing the cost of living. The government are also classed as regulators of labour markets, this involves initiating new laws and regulations that have an impact upon the relationship between employer and employee. In addition, they play act as the welfare state, ensuring they are able to aid those who have been made redundant or struggling with financial difficulties. Being the largest employer with 5.39 million workers employed, the government sees itself as a eloquent employer and wants to show private sectors how to do this. This report will look the role the government plays with regards to gender equality in the UK. There has been an improvement in the amount of females in the labour market. Since the beginning, there has always been more men employed them women. The office of national statistics shows during the third quarter of 2020, 78.6% of men were employed opposed to the 71.9% of women who have been employed, a difference of just under 7%, this is near enough the lowest the difference has ever been and is a huge improvement considering the gap was 11.5% ten years ago. These numbers have however been affected heavily by the covid-19 pandemic. The employment rates of males has remained around 70%, however females have increased immensely. Since the great recession in 2008 in which women employment was roughly 67%, women employment has increased by around 5%. ONS suggests that women employment was at an all time high in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic of 72.6%, showing a positive change from 52.8% in 1971. The changes in state pension age for women has had a slight impact on this increase meaning less females retiring between the ages of 60-65. This increase in the number of women in the labour market has initiated a positive attitude towards the support of gender equality. There are several reasons for the growth in numbers of females in the workforce, one huge reason is the government acting as regulators of labour markets and initiating laws, these laws include the lone parent income support and equality act 2010, equality and human right commission, employment act 2008 and equality act 2006. From the start of 2008 to 2010, male employment rate went down by 4%, whereas for females just under 2% due to so many being made redundant. The years following the UK recession saw a loss in numbers of female full time workers, but an improvement in the number of part time employees. Fortunately, since the end of 2012 the full time employment has grown. During recession, many organisations recruited part time workers and full time workers were made redundant to help with labour costs and still have the same productivity from employees. This process is referred to as labour market flexibility, (Bell and Blanchflower, 2010). And is a process that the state were supportive of to help get the labour market back to the equilibrium, and was beneficial for part time employees. To have a greater effect, the UK government should have implemented a different strategy in order to support all those affected with the great recession. Despite many efforts for many years, gender equality is still a major and worldwide issue within the workplace. The global gender gap report 2020 stated there are \"massive inequalities in almost all of the UK\u2019s fasted-growing job clusters of the future\", this is a worrying stat as in order to sustain an effective workforce in the future, it is crucial that women are able to access resources that would aid the upbringing of children, inevitably the future labour market. Improvement in gender equality in the workplace with regards to the opportunities available, would allow women to contribute and support the UK economy. A study conducted by PwC (2020), suggests \"steps have been made towards advancing gender equality, however progress is slow\". This statement comes from results showing that the UK\u2019s position remaining at 16th however still doing better than OECD average. Another major and insightful fact from this study reports that if the UK were able to achieve the same level of female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by a staggering $252 billion. This supports the importance of allowing women the same opportunities and resources as men and pushing the gender equality agenda, because of the great impact it could have on the UK economy. An article written by the guardian states, \"the UK has fallen from 15th to 21st\" with regards to being the most equal nation. Although there has been progress in the number of women in the labour market, the UK are still far below its European neighbours with the gender equality rankings and shows that gender inequality is still of a major concern. Another major dilemma within the workforce is gender pay gap which supports the gender inequality regime. 8,424 private sector employers reported their data, with 3,746 employers noticing their pay gap improve whilst 3,387 seeing pay gap worsen, and 645 employers seeing no change. This supports that the statement that gender equality is still an issue. However, with regards to part-time employees women on average earn more, a possible reason for females earning more in part time field is it gives them flexibility to complete other commitments meaning more women doing part-time and higher earnings. The state of UK has played its role with the improvement in the gender pay gap with the policies and laws that have been legislated. Companies with more than 50 employees are now required to execute an equal pay audit, this identifies any differences in pay between men and women doing equal work. As an employer, doing an audit shows your dedication to remove any unfair pay. This comes as a part of the equal pay act 2010, which came into force to give both men and women a right to equal pay for equal work and has been implemented to protect people from discrimination. In 2017, it was compulsory for any company with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gap report, this comes as change as originally companies could publish this voluntarily. A negative to this law is that it is only compulsory for companies to report, however not actually make amendments to the pay gap. Since the beginning of gender pay gap being analysed, this issue has still not been resolved and could still be a problem for the foreseeable future, this comes as a result of the lack of determination from the UK government to resolve this issue. To help minimise gender pay gap and to resolve the issue of pay inequality, national minimum wage was enacted as a plan. This is significant as this was the UK governments\u2019 first national and cross-sectural attempt to regulate low pay. Dube (2017) found that in America for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, over the long run, the poverty rate is expected to decline by 5.3 percent, this emphasises the importance of minimum wage. In 2016, national living wage was implemented to help and support females in the workforce, however with the increase of the minimum national living wage by 4.9% in 2019, nearly 3 million children are still in poverty with parents who are at work. This proves that it is still of a major concern. Women make up 60% of workers on the national living wage, meaning at least one third of females are not on a wage that they could live on. The Fawcett society also mentioned that increasing the minimum wage to the real living wage, would help in resolving the gender pay gap issue. With regards to public sector, the government are doing there best to set an example to private sector companies, this is evident as an article from the public finance states that based on the number of employees in the senior government roles, UK is top in the EU and only fourth in the G20 nations. Presently, the gender pay gap amongst all employees in the public sector is 15.5%, which is a slight improvement, as in the last decade the gap has increased by roughly 4%. The most recent data conducted by ONS was in 2018, and suggests there has been an increase of 10.9 percentage points from 31 march 2008 to 31 march 2018 which at that point was 42.7% of female employees working at senior civil service level. This is a positive sign and shows gradual improvement year by year. In the executive officer and administrate responsibility levels, there are more females then male employees. Females still dominate with the number of civil service employees, however decreased by 0.1% from 2018 to 2019 which is not a positive sign. To prevent gender inequality occurring within the public sector, the government have enacted public sector equality duty. PSED \"requires public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity\" (Fredman, 2011).and ensure good relations between employees. This act requires public authorities to published quality objectives every four years as a minimum, also information to show they are cooperating with the public sector equality duty. PSED has yet to accomplish the goals it was set out to perform, as gender inequality is still present within the public sector. ONS shows that gender pay gap still exists amongst all of the professions within the public sector, showing more still needs to be done to resolve gender inequality. This affects the government\u2019s stance as aiming to be a role model, and portrays a negative image for the private sector employers. The UK government has attempted to find the perfect solution for gender inequality and has done this through various techniques including creating new laws to tackle the issues. There are still many issues occurring presently such as , gender pay gap, the number of females in the higher positions in contrast to males, the significant amount of women who are not on a wage that they could live on. One major law that was implemented by the government which was crucial was the Equality act 2010, this was a good intervention is helping with equality, however both males and females being represented equally still seems to be on concern. Equal pay has gradually been improving, however still seems a long way from the end goal, a solution to this could be a stricter approach towards companies like setting deadlines, ensuring equal pay becomes a priority for companies. To help with the millions of females who struggle to earn a wage to live on, the government should make this a priority by encouraging organisations to pay the real living wage and to make it mandatory. The national minimum wage is a positive for low pay workers (which is dominated by females), however there are still millions who earn less than the real living wage. Therefore the government need to implement new strategies to tackle this. The positions of more authority within organisations still have majority of men as the employees, the government should encourage females to apply for these higher positions by showing other women who have been able to become employees of these top positions, this could be used as motivation for females to feel that they are also able to achieve these roles. It is vital that the skills and potential of women in the UK are used to a maximum, as mentioned previously if the UK were able to reach the same female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by $252 billion, which would help decrease the gender pay gap and boost the economy significantly. This shows if the UK government are able to fulfil their roles efficiently as the biggest employers, and regulators of labour market, they could definitely help with gender inequality in the UK", "positive": "In brief, I have mentioned how the celebrities used are popular and have good reputation with being nominated for awards in their own fields, also how the campaign consists of celebrities enjoying the Christmas atmosphere together whilst wearing products, sharing positivity fulfilling the psychological needs of belongingness and esteem needs.

{"id": "aug_300", "anchor": "The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport\u2019s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA\u2019s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims. Corruption is defined as \u2018dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority\u2019. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the \u2018spirit of sport\u2019 which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example. Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so. It is very possible that chalking Armstrong\u2019s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA? Clean athletes often lose out The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures \u2018clean athletes don\u2019t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments\u2019. Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping. Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete\u2019s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA\u2019s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete\u2019s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS\u2019 shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was \u2018\u2026 the most detrimental aspect of the Code\u2019. One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies. There is not a \u2018level playing field\u2019 It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in \u2018sophisticated doping\u2019 in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are \u2018unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated\u2019. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists. Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya\u2019s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success. It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean. WADA cannot enforce consequences 'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that \u2018at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach\u2019. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country. The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was \u2018a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.\u2019 For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies\u2019 ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to. Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being \u2018neutral athletes\u2019 provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. Legalising doping is flawed It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations. While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious. It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change. Conclusion It has been argued that WADA\u2019s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", "positive": "lo , I will update my today to show I am doing a placement.

{"id": "aug_303", "anchor": "\"Intro The Alpha Inhibition Hypothesis (AIH) is when high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas. the current experiment tested the alpha inhibition hypothesis using a cued visual attention task and predicted that; if recording from the left parietal lobe participants' alpha range activities would be higher in the cue left than cue right condition. Method A partial replication of an experiment was conducted, and it included recording alpha amplitudes from the left parietal lobe (P3), analysing the activity 200ms before stimulus onset in the cue left and cue right conditions. Results The results were significant and were consistent with the hypothesis. It can be concluded that the results supported the theory that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. Experiment write up, 1200 +- 10% (min1080, max1320) words, titles, title page tables, figures &amp; reference list not included in count Introduction The AIH, states that more alpha activity in one hemisphere leads to loss of attention and the disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (the other hemisphere), this indicates inhibition. Whereas less activity in one hemisphere leads to the opposite; an increase in attention and engagement (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha activity or waves are a type of brain wave. They are produced in circumstances of rest, especially when your eyes are closed and happen before you fall asleep (Alpha Waves and How They Help You Sleep, n.d.). The AIH is supported with research such as (Handel et al., 2011) who used a MEG (magneto-encephalogram) which has better spatial resolution and similar temporal resolution to an EEG for better results. They found that alpha activity is reduced in contralateral brain areas to the stimuli presented, that alpha activity is influenced by attention. A partial replication of Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) experiment: \"A shift of visual spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\", was conducted to compare alpha amplitudes at P3 between conditions and prove the hypothesis that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. As stimuli always processes contralaterally (opposite side of activity) We wanted to find out whether if, a side of the visual field was cued, would it lead to alpha inhibition on the contralateral side where participants anticipated the stimuli would appear? And which side would show bigger alpha amplitudes? Method Participants 38 undergraduate students took part in the research via volunteer sampling, there were originally 39, but one participant\u2019s data were removed as their data were only available for one of the two conditions. Design The design of the study was a repeated measure, the independent variable was whether the arrow cues pointed left or right, it also had two levels known as cue left and cue right. The dependent variable was the alpha amplitudes measured in \u00b5V (microvolts), recorded from P3. Materials A Biopac MP36 was used to collect data and EEG Electrodes were attached to participants\u2019 scalps using AC cream, Everi cream. PsychoPy software was used to present stimuli for a specific period of time and send event markers set to end immediately to Biopac, through a Stimtracker device. The Stimuli used were two white bars on a black background, one large, one small (see figure 1). Two arrows, one pointing left and one pointing right (see figure 2). And white fixation cross (see figure 3). Procedure Firstly, the Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz, digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and Stimtracker, event markers let us know when stimuli were shown. Calculation channels were set up to record activity in the alpha frequency range from 8-13Hz before checking the impedance, with the sampling rate being 1000 Hz, alpha amplitudes were also measured. Participants had EEG electrodes with AC cream on them placed on their scalps using the 1020 positioning system (Trans-Cranial Techologies.,2012), with P3 being recorded. The active electrode was placed at P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz, an earth electrode was attached to the forehead near the hairline and everything was measured relative to Cz.The areas were scrubbed with Everi cream beforehand for better adhesion. They were then asked to complete a cued visual attention task using PsychoPy. Cued with a fixation cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms an arrow indicating whether it would be the left or right side of the visual field the target, would appear, in the centre of the screen for 34ms whilst participants were asked by the experimenter to focus their attention to that side of the visual field. There was 50% chance of being cued left or right. There were different event markers for cue left and right conditions and they were sent at stimulus onset. There were 20 blocks of 4 trial types, each block had cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) randomised within blocks with half of trials cued left and half cued right. Results The raw 9-13Hz Alpha EEG data for each condition was analysed using the event markers sent from PsychoPy to identify when the stimuli would be presented. We looked at the period of 200ms of recorded activity before stimulus presentation, after arrow cues had been shown and used Biopac by rectifying and averaging over 50 samples of raw alpha data to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. This smooths out the data (averaging over samples), reduces the impact of outlyingextreme values and converts negative values to positive, so we get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. Statistical Analysis Table 1 shows that the rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were higher in the cue left condition than the cue right condition. According to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the difference was significant, and the inferential statistics are as follows (t=566, n=38, p&lt;0.005). Discussion The results were significant, so we used a non-parametric test to find the inferential statistics from the data collected. The results fit with the hypothesis as the results are consistent with AIH as recorded activity from P3cue left were higher than cue right, which were the task irrelevant brain areas, suggesting that alpha suppression happened there. Methodological issues that could have affected the results could have been varying levels of impedance, associated with more variance in the measurements but would affect both conditions equally. Another methodological issue that could have affected results could have been artefacts, such as blinking, that would affect the waves. From the experiment overall, I conclude that the AIH is highly supported by research as it has high temporal reliability, and despite all the methodological issues, the results are still valid.\"", "positive": "Dear CEO, These are what I was able to find with the list you have given me: I found a central hotel called Radisson Blu seaside hotel, which costs \u00a391 per night and \u00a3181 for 2 nights which satisfies your budget conditions of \u00a3200 and location conditions of being close to water.

{"id": "aug_305", "anchor": "Mandler\u2019s model of the adult semantic system is an explanation of concept development that discusses three claims. Firstly, the fundamental distinction between the core categories; animals\u2019 vs non-animals, secondly; the system is organised hierarchically, and finally, the system is categorically organised from its inception. This essay will evaluate the evidence supporting and disputing Mandler\u2019s second and third claims, with emphasis on the latter in attempt to understand adult cognitive functions. Beginning with the third claim; the semantic system is categorically organised from its inception. Habituation paradigms have been used to examine this implication, using very young infants to investigate distinctions between biological and non-biological motions. Research (Bertenthal et al., 1987) (Simion, Regolin, &amp; Bulf, 2008) has demonstrated young infants\u2019 sensitivity and ability to distinguish between the two motions, therefore suggesting an innate predisposition for this ability, and have highlighted how this distinction is made before language acquisition. Therefore, supporting Mandler\u2019s third claim, whilst also providing supporting evidence for Mandler\u2019s first claim; that distinctions are made animals vs non-animals. The convergence of evidence supports the validity of the conclusions made. However, such research can be criticised in respects to the validity of the methodology. Habituation techniques rely on reengagement of attention when presented with a new stimulus. The result of the young infants\u2019 habituation and dishabituation may be caused by a perceptual difference, not a conceptual one. A view supported by Sloutsky (2003) who argued infants are good at detecting perceptual similarity but do not have conceptual understanding. When investigating the categorical organisation of the semantic system, habituation paradigms fail to answer at what point this process begins, which challenges Mandler\u2019s third claim, consequently presenting an argument that categorical organisation does not begin as early as Mandler perhaps suggests. Therefore, we can ask, at what point does this early category organisation begin. To examine this, we must look at Mandler\u2019s second claim; the system is organised hierarchically. There is much debate regarding which depiction of early category organisations is more accurate. There are two main hypothesises which debate the hierarchical organisation. Rosch (1978) argues a basic-level hypothesis, and suggests we learn concepts in a bottom-up order. The basic-level is the first conceptual level, it focuses on within-category similarity and between-category dissimilarity. Later in development, the superordinate-level emerges and following that, the subordinate-level. The basic-level occupies a privileged position in the hierarchy in semantic cognition (Rosch, 1978), (Bauer &amp; Just, 2017). Supporting experimental research (Daehler, Lonardo &amp; Bukatko 1979) has found infants made basic-level matches more easily than superordinate ones, and case study research (Clark, 1973) has found children\u2019s first words for objects are often basic-level. The triangulation of methods used across the research supporting the basic-level hypothesis suggests consistency across findings and validates their conclusions. That said, this theory cannot explain the linguistic biases children may be influenced by; when adults label stimuli for children, it is often at the basic-level i.e. adults are more likely use the label \u2018bed\u2019 rather than furniture (superordinate-level) or sofa bed (subordinate). This infers that such organisation is possibly guided through linguistic influences and not through bottom up processing as thought. On the contrary, Mandler has provided an alternative depiction of early category taxonomies; the global-conceptions hypothesis. Using a top-down approach, claims an infant\u2019s first conceptual categories are not at the basic-level, but at a global level which resemble superordinate domains, however there are no basic-level classes within them. Supported through her experimental research using object examination tasks (Mandler &amp; MacDonough 1993), it was found superordinate distinctions were made (animals vs vehicles) in young infants but basic-level contrasts were not (dog vs fish). A criticism regarding the validity of this research is made by Jones &amp; Smith (1993) who argue for the importance of perceptually rich stimuli to be used in concept developmental studies. Real dogs and real fish obtain different features to that of a toy version, i.e. smells, textures and sizes. This research lacks mundane realism. Therefore, assuming the distinctions cannot be made between the basic-level contrast is arguably invalid. It is also important to state how negative results for a basic-level hypothesis does not create positive results for the global-conceptions hypothesis. Reflecting upon the research presented, there is no clear answer to which hypothesis is correct; both present insightful explanations into early categorical organisation and adult cognitive functioning. Neither hypothesis however address the issue regarding perceptual vs conceptual organisation; do infants and children have a conceptual understanding of stimuli or can they just acknowledge their perceptual differences. Further critiquing Mandler\u2019s third claim in regard to the implication of early categorical organisation being prior to language acquisition. Asking at which point language interferes with conceptual organisation may provide an answer to when we are able to distinguish between perceptual differences and conceptual understanding. The role of perceptual similarity in categorisation has been investigated by Gelman and Coley (1990) who used typical and atypical category members and looked at the influence of linguistic support upon the judgements made by 2-year olds. They found appearance controls judgement about category membership in absence of linguistic support in young children, however when provided with labels, category membership rather than perceptual appearance guides the interferences about category properties. From this, we can assume older infants obtain a conceptual understanding regardless of perceptual inferences due to linguistic guidance. An important factor of this research is challenging prototypicality of categories, and the influences it has upon children in their conceptual development when organising. It could be argued that prototypicality of prior research into early categorisation may disguise children\u2019s distinctions between perception and conception, suggesting the ability to distinguish may be sooner than this research indicates, supporting Mandler\u2019s third claim. In conclusion, this essay suggests the research evidence into concept development has greatly contributed to understanding adults cognitive functioning. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding at which stage infants can truly distinguish between conceptual understanding and perceptual differences. One weakness of this evaluation is the research discussed only considers that of typical development and ignores atypical developmental outcomes.", "positive": "n if it\u2019s fake confidence In that scenario, are you my sister we\u2019ve spoke about this before, guys don\u2019t like anything in particular about a woman, all women are the same, it\u2019s the confidence they\u2019re attracted to so if you\u2019re confident, he\u2019ll fancy you, if you\u2019re not, you\u2019ll only attract even less confident men Which is a place we are NEVER going back to YES!!!! let\u2019s get u a shag He has an android which I feel is also your type Android and avengers have the same energy it\u2019s your type 100% Not the dweeby kind of guys you sometimes go for, they make me sick", "positive_attacked": "n if it\u2019s fake confidence In that scenario, are you my sister we\u2019ve spoke about this before, guys don\u2019t like anything in particular about a woman, all women are the same, it\u2019s the confidence they\u2019re attracted to so if you\u2019re confident, he\u2019ll fancy you, if you\u2019re not, you\u2019ll only attract even less confident men Which is a place we are NEVER going back to YES!!!! let\u2019s get u a shag He has an android which I feel is also your type Android and avengers have the same energy it\u2019s your type 100% Not the dweeby kind of guys you sometimes go for, they make me sick", "label": 1}

Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging \u00c2\u00a3163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available.

{"id": "aug_317", "anchor": "Assessing Attitudes Towards Zoos Introduction: This study\u2019s hypothesis is that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos would have a wide variation. This is because some participants may have a positive attitude due to their involvement in conserving species, and some a negative attitude due to animal captivity. Reade and Waran (1996) support this, stating that zoo visitors have positive perceptions of zoos whereas members of the general public have negative views. Method: Positive and negative statements about zoos were pooled in which 10 of each were selected for the pilot study (Appendix 1), which recruited 10 participants. Negative statement scores were then reversed, so that negative attitudes equate to low scores, and vice versa. To assess the internal validity of the pilot questionnaire, each participant\u2019s scores were totalled (see Appendix 3), and the 4 highest and lowest scored participants were selected. The 4s and 5s selected by positive and negative participants were compared to assess whether an item was discriminatory. Statements differing in scores between these participants fit into such criteria. 4 discriminatory positive and negative statements were selected for the main study (Appendix 2). The 10 original participants were recruited for this version, along with a further 10. The totals of each original participant were compared between the pilot and main study (Appendix 4) to assess the questionnaire\u2019s reliability. Total scores of all participants were then calculated (Appendix 5). Results: The internal validity test (Appendix 3) showed that 11 statements were discriminatory: 4 negative, and 7 positive. The lowest scores ranged from 41 to 45, while the highest ranged from 55 to 69. These participants reported either the most negative or positive attitudes respectively. Only two participants produced the same score when completing the pilot study and the main study (Appendix 4). A Spearman\u2019s Rho test found that there was a significantly strong correlation between the test and re-test scores (rs = .838, p &lt; .01). 90% of participants scored higher in the pilot study compared to the main study. 3 of the 4 positive statements had standard deviations (SD) over 1 (Appendix 2), meaning that there was a wider variation of responses to these, whilst negative statements had SDs less than 1. The statement with the lowest SD was positive (SD = .489), whilst the highest was negative (SD = 1.268). As the hypothesis suggested, participants had a wide variation of scores (M = 22.4, SD = 4.297), ranging from 16 to 28 (Appendix 5). This SD indicates a large spread of data across the mean. Conclusion: The results of Appendix 3 showed that there was high internal validity since the positive and negative statements differed in scores by participants, suggesting that the questionnaire measures what it was set out to measure. The Spearman\u2019s Rho test showed that the questionnaire had high test-retest reliability as results from participants were similar in the pilot compared to the main study (Appendix 4). The larger SD of the final responses of the positive statements indicate that the results are widely spread across the mean, while the smaller SDs for the negative statements suggest that there was less of a variation in responses to these. Therefore, it can be concluded that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos do not have a wide variation, as participant\u2019s responses were polarised, with a smaller variance in responses with negative statements compared to positive.", "positive": "I just wanted to get in contact as I am interested in volunteering to be a research assistant, and was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what the role would entail?

Thank you for your assistance I have now received the invitation. Kind regards, Good morning , I hope that you are well. I wanted to update you on my progress with my dissertation research for my proposal and what further steps I can take with my proposal in the meantime. I have a high number of sources and want to make a start on my proposal so I have adequate to perfect it. Do you have any examples of structure and guidance that I can use for my proposal? Furthermore, I have some questions from one of my colleagues whose supervisor has not been responding. Firstly, are case studies a part of the literature review or the research designmethodology when you are reviewing effects on the case studies? Secondly, for the literature review in the proposal are we meant to highlight key areas as the entire literature would be exceedingly long. Any assistance that you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

{"id": "aug_330", "anchor": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs \u00a3157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a caf\u00e9. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a caf\u00e9 to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Caf\u00e9 Kluuvikatu 3, caf\u00e9 which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too.

You need to have a strong interest and understanding of to understand the content! So definitely do the double credit module in second year for this. And also, If you\u2019re interested in the electives- maybe enrol on the principles of modules in second year. However, you may need a first in in first year to have the prerequisites for those modules.. Atleast that\u2019s what I had to do! It may have changed \ud83d\ude0a Everyone in my year doing the double degree enrolled onto the major, and I wouldn\u2019t say you need to focus on any specific modules in second year with that major. The wave also gives you the most flexibility- as you can choose three modules that interest you instead of having a set syllabus like the rest. set you up quite well- you\u2019ll be studying a mixture of modules across years, and they usually give you the introductory ones first to get you settled \ud83d\ude0a For the major, obviously do one or two modules in second year to give you a better foundation.

For this major I would definitely study an module if it isn\u2019t compulsory for you in second year, as the Module at looked fairly similar to what I had studied at - so it would help \ud83d\ude0a You\u2019ve still got plenty of time to choose your major, the major is the only one that I would say you don\u2019t need to think about second year modules, but the rest definitely consider what I said above!

{"id": "aug_342", "anchor": "Introduction The non-binary gender movement is seen as a relatively new phenomenon due to increased activism in the years 2015 and 2016 (Richards, Bouman, &amp; Barker, 2017). Campaigning for awareness and inclusion by organisations such as the Non-Binary Inclusion Project has brought the conversation into mainstream society, however there is a longer supressed history. Consequently, there is very limited literature regarding non-binary individuals and the social attitudes towards them. Day and Nicholls\u2019 (2019) produced a paper exploring attitudes of non-transgender students towards transgender people which induced interest in the presented research topic. As history has progressed, society has shown to become more accepting of people and ideas that lay outside the norm. However, statistics by YouGov show that 41% of trans people and 31% of non-binary people have experienced a hate crime in the last 12 months (YouGov, 2017). Therefore, research is needed to establish whether attitudes have truly changed. The research question I was looking to investigate was \"What attitudes are present towards those who identify as non-binary?\". Key discourses to uncover include; what is considered normal with gender, the challenges non-binary people face and whether society is widely accepting of these individuals. This led to the development of the semi-structured interview schedule included as appendix 1. Looking at attitudes towards non-binary individuals meant a participant who was not non-binary could be selected. This facilitated discourse analysis and Willig\u2019s 6-stage process was followed (Willig, 2008). Due to confidentiality reasons, the interviewee will be referred to as Anna. Analysis Key discourses identified refer to the construction of \"others\", identification as a choice and the fluctuating permanence of societal views. Construction of Others Anna used language in a way that constructed non-binary people as being separate others. Individuals were spoken about as if they were distinctly different to the interviewee, who identifies as a cisgender female, and to other members of society. This demonstrates the normalisation of identifying as your assigned sex at birth and the rejection of people who do not fit into the norm. The choice of wording being \"experienced something\" to describe non-binary identification almost has connotations of a religious or spiritual awakening. It seems to suggest that non-binary people have had an association with a higher power which had led them to think that they are more than male or female. As gender governs human lives, perhaps non-binary individuals are likened to being more than human. This comment is significant as it regards non-binary people in a higher respect than people who identify with just one gender. Even though they are considered to be others, this may be in a positive rather than negative light. The use of \"experience\" also assumes that non-binary individuals have not always felt this way and that something has occurred in order for this identification to proceed. This indicates a conscious choice, a discourse that will be explored further on. Despite the previous positive symbolism, Anna goes on to express the need for another category for non-binary people. She initially used the word \"definitely\", which has strong intentions, when explaining that this should be the case. This was retracted when repeating the end of the sentence suggesting that this was misspoke. This could indicate that this was her true opinion which may have then been altered in order to appear more socially acceptable and to fit in with the general consensus of a progressive society. This signifies that society as a whole may not be as complicit in \u2018othering\u2019 behaviour as Anna was herself. Again, Anna has added to the discourse of othering by the use of the phrase \"something else\" to refer to non-binary individuals. The choice of the word \"thing\" rather than person is dehumanising and creates a distance between her and non-binary individuals. Anna is no longer able to relate to the \"thing\" and an outgroup has been created. Social identity theory states that members of an ingroup believe that their ingroup is distinctive from and superior to the outgroup which then leads to discrimination against outgroups (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). In this situation, non-binary individuals are considered to be inferior which aids prejudicial treatment. In contrast to this, Anna uses the word \"we\" when saying \"we\u2019re living in a free world\". Using this discursive tool places the interviewer, participant, non-binary and gender conforming individuals into the same societal group. This assumes that the free world is for everyone and the same privileges are received by all. She considers non-binary individuals to have the freedom to express themselves how they desire without persecution, which suggests a wider belief that society is permitting of people acting how they choose to. However, this does not indicate that negative attitudes have ceased, rather that people are just choosing to suppress verbal opinions. Identification as a Choice Anna heavily drew upon discourses which presented non-binary identification as a conscious choice. Individuals were considered to have alternative experiences to those who identified with their assigned sex which led them towards their identification. This reveals how identifying with your biological sex is considered to be the default and other identifications are decision based. Anna has used the term \"believe\" once again when referring to non-binary people. Belief is an expression commonly used when declaring concepts that are intangible or that do not have a scientific basis, for example religion or mythical beings. Likening non-binary people\u2019s existence to something that is either believed in or not indicates that their presence is not acknowledged by society as being authentic. By describing non-binary individuals in this way, it is extremely damaging to their sense of identity. Findings by Johnson et al. (2019) showed that invalidation in multiple social contexts contributed to negative affective and cognitive processes for non-binary adolescents which included confusion, self-doubt and internalised shame. This demonstrates that unconscious negative biases are held in society and these have detrimental effects for non-binary people. Anna used the phrase \"that\u2019s become quite popular at the moment\" when talking about how people are identifying as non-binary. This is important as it does not denote permanence and likens this movement to a trend or a song. It suggests that people may decide to identify as non-binary while it is popular this year, but this phenomenon will be seen to disappear again as soon as it arrived. By using language in this way to create the discourse of choice, the experiences of non-binary people are invalidated. Their personal struggles with identity are minimised or even dismissed and struggles with stereotyping and bullying are disregarded. Additionally, by using the word \"recently\" she does not acknowledge the rich and diverse history of non-binary identification and the consequences that derived from identifying in this way. This is due to a lack of knowledge and reflects the lack of queer education in society. A report from GLAAD found that increased knowledge about LGBT people led to lower levels of discomfort towards this community and reduced LBGT discrimination (GLAAD, 2014). This demonstrates that ignorance may be fuelling negative social attitudes and education could lead to a change. Permanence of Societal Views Anna used language which implied varying degrees of permanence to current views. Some societal views were constructed as being temporary and some were constructed as being concrete and resistant to change. This quote was referring to the use of discrete categories for clothing in dress stores. By using the phrase \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" Anna acknowledges that there is room for improvement of societal attitudes. She suggests that if there was a large-scale change for example by a clothing company, then people would be relieved from the binary which would increase open-mindedness. This is juxtaposed by the phrase \"but it very much is\" which is contradicting to the original message. This implies that while there is the opportunity for enhancing the lives of others, there is a lack of drive. This negative outlook suggests that individuals in society are focused on keeping the superiority of their own ingroup, at the cost of the well-being of the non-binary out group. Anna used the phrase \"at the moment\" 5 times during the course of the interview. This was used when comparing non-binary activism to various social movements such as feminism, gender equality and Black Lives Matter. By using words such as \"minute\" and \"moment\", social movements are perceived to be current and short natured. This may show that years of activism go unnoticed by society if it does not benefit the majority. By constructing language in this way, Anna demonstrates how society is only able to comprehend one change at a time. Feminism is the sole focus and only when this is achieved, will non-binary issues take the forefront. Anna also uses the word \"they\" when talking about equality. This choice of word removes responsibility from herself for actioning change. This suggests that only certain people hold this power, potentially only those in authority. This stance would explain why non-binary progression in society is slow as it reflects the belief that not everyone is in the position to make a difference. People either do not recognise that they could be valuable allies in fighting for queer rights, or they do not believe it is their place. By using language like this, Anna is recognising that non-binary individuals are not considered to have achieved equality in society. To Conclude In deconstructing the language used by Anna to describe non-binary people, a main negative attitude prevailed which may be due to a lack of understanding. Discourses constructed non-binary individuals as being distinctly different to the interviewee and identifying this way by choice. Social attitudes were also constructed as having varying permanence. The inconsistencies uncovered reflect that there may be diverse social attitudes towards non-binary individuals.", "positive": "t\u2019s what I thought so was like there we go But just gonna leave it now She\u2019s knows I weren\u2019t happy she said as well \" said you wouldn\u2019t care\" and I was like yes I wouldn\u2019t have if you\u2019d have TOLD ME And I said has no loyalties to me?

It's a textbook for that doesn't have an eBook version on : This book has plenty of available copies in the library but as the library is closed and I am no longer on campus, I was wondering how I would go about trying to get this book. Do I ask if I can have the book posted? Would there be a way to get eBook access? Any help with this would be much appreciated. Kind regards, , 1st Year Student Rep Hi , Firstly I would like to apologise for spelling your name incorrectly in my first email to you. Secondly, thank you for the email back to clarify how the library is still trying to help students. I will definitely have a look around on for other books, thank you. I have another question. I have library books currently in my possession. I've read other library messages about the deadline for books being extended to around the because that would be the end of Term 3, and that students don't have to keep updating the library system each week to extend the return date as it's automatically set to in . My question is: If the University library is not open by that time, would students be recommended to post their library books through Royal Mail or hold onto them until Term 1 in ?

I just have a general question based on the discussion, so the methodological and theoretical implications on why the study did not turn out the way it did, would that be a separate section or would they be embedded when talking about each predictor from the global model ? Because I have the content on why each predictor was not significant both the theoretical and methodological explanation but not sure how to layout the discussion to not repeat myself in the limitations and application section. I am aware that there is no right answer but I am a little worried that it will look a little messy. I hope this makes sense.

{"id": "aug_348", "anchor": "r , I'm really disappointed with how has handled my recurrent noise complaints against my flatmate. I have had to contact security myself 6 times within the last 2 weeks and my flatmate has also contacted security a number of times. I cannot understand why this flatmate has not been dealt with. I have not slept in 3 weeks due to his constant loud noise. This is seriously disturbing my life at Uni and more importantly disturbing my studies and that of my other flatmates aswell. I spoke to a member of staff at the Reception at on , who was extremely unhelpful and the noise still continues from about 9pm to 8am everyday. I was told that the problem of noise complaints was only dealt with by security but since they are not getting through to this flatmate, it should be escalated to yourselves as this is becoming highly unprofessional and is not the student care I expect for the money I am paying for my accommodation and student services. I would highly appreciate having this looked into immediately and looking at solutions to resolve the recurrent noise.

{"id": "aug_354", "anchor": ", I know its late but just finished the study hopefully it will be to your liking. I did this as neautral no load, neg and then positive. Was wondering about how we would counterbalance this and the best way you want me to do this ie. If you want me to change the stimuli ie mix up stimuli ie. Happy and fun for one participant and happy and love for another participant or If you wanna mix up the slide numbers. In addition, I know you said about blocks vs trials so wondered how this would all factor as I know you said about giving half the pps a blocked version and another a randomised order. So do I give half pps the same ppt and the other half a counterbalanced one Furthermore, as the contact hours are max 30 hours for pps and our study would take 45 mins approx. This would mean we would need 40 pps instead of the planned 60 so was also wondering how this change would work Sorry for all the bother I appreciate our help so much! Thank you, Kind regards, Noted. Just wanted to see if I could play around and see if this was available on qualtrics. Will send a ppt slide by today hopefully.

{"id": "aug_355", "anchor": "Assessing Attitudes Towards Zoos Introduction: This study\u2019s hypothesis is that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos would have a wide variation. This is because some participants may have a positive attitude due to their involvement in conserving species, and some a negative attitude due to animal captivity. Reade and Waran (1996) support this, stating that zoo visitors have positive perceptions of zoos whereas members of the general public have negative views. Method: Positive and negative statements about zoos were pooled in which 10 of each were selected for the pilot study (Appendix 1), which recruited 10 participants. Negative statement scores were then reversed, so that negative attitudes equate to low scores, and vice versa. To assess the internal validity of the pilot questionnaire, each participant\u2019s scores were totalled (see Appendix 3), and the 4 highest and lowest scored participants were selected. The 4s and 5s selected by positive and negative participants were compared to assess whether an item was discriminatory. Statements differing in scores between these participants fit into such criteria. 4 discriminatory positive and negative statements were selected for the main study (Appendix 2). The 10 original participants were recruited for this version, along with a further 10. The totals of each original participant were compared between the pilot and main study (Appendix 4) to assess the questionnaire\u2019s reliability. Total scores of all participants were then calculated (Appendix 5). Results: The internal validity test (Appendix 3) showed that 11 statements were discriminatory: 4 negative, and 7 positive. The lowest scores ranged from 41 to 45, while the highest ranged from 55 to 69. These participants reported either the most negative or positive attitudes respectively. Only two participants produced the same score when completing the pilot study and the main study (Appendix 4). A Spearman\u2019s Rho test found that there was a significantly strong correlation between the test and re-test scores (rs = .838, p &lt; .01). 90% of participants scored higher in the pilot study compared to the main study. 3 of the 4 positive statements had standard deviations (SD) over 1 (Appendix 2), meaning that there was a wider variation of responses to these, whilst negative statements had SDs less than 1. The statement with the lowest SD was positive (SD = .489), whilst the highest was negative (SD = 1.268). As the hypothesis suggested, participants had a wide variation of scores (M = 22.4, SD = 4.297), ranging from 16 to 28 (Appendix 5). This SD indicates a large spread of data across the mean. Conclusion: The results of Appendix 3 showed that there was high internal validity since the positive and negative statements differed in scores by participants, suggesting that the questionnaire measures what it was set out to measure. The Spearman\u2019s Rho test showed that the questionnaire had high test-retest reliability as results from participants were similar in the pilot compared to the main study (Appendix 4). The larger SD of the final responses of the positive statements indicate that the results are widely spread across the mean, while the smaller SDs for the negative statements suggest that there was less of a variation in responses to these. Therefore, it can be concluded that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos do not have a wide variation, as participant\u2019s responses were polarised, with a smaller variance in responses with negative statements compared to positive.", "positive": ", Apologies for the late response, I just wanted to say a massive thank you for helping me out.

{"id": "aug_358", "anchor": "Hi Ms (name), After reviewing the local area in Helsinki, I have planned an itinerary for you to view. Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging \u00c2\u00a3163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros.

Will you make all the important points you say today available on or online? Sorry for any inconveniences Hi , I\u2019m currently working on my dissertation and I\u2019ve made progress. I forgot to ask you this last week because I was focused on the surveys. I had plans for the actual dissertation to carry out interviews to supplement the secondary data, seeing as there is limited explicit information on the homeland-diaspora perceptions. I know we discussed about the surveys and I\u2019ve let that go. But I would like to know your thoughts so I can submit the form on time as well as include it in my methodology section. If you think it\u2019s not worth doing so, please let me know so I can continue with the proposal. Details about the interview: To enlist 8 participants (4 who live in the U.K. and 4 who live in ) and ask specifically tailored questions to see the differing views. The plan is to have 4 older people (2 female, 2 male) and 4 younger people (2 female and 2 male) to see if there\u2019s a difference in perspectives due to age. Hope to hear from you soon, \ufeffHi &amp; , I\u2019ve decided I want to do question 1 for the questions but I\u2019m a bit uncertain as to what to narrow it down to.

Many thanks once again ! Hello , Thank you for your prompt response. I do not think I need any more information on the report, though thank you for the preview. Kind Regards, Hello , I knew I'd forget something aha ! A final question I had was on appendices, as I've never used them in formal writing however in the coursework, they were used quite a lot to further explain things that they didn't have sufficient word count to be able to explain within the report itself. Resultantly, are appendices necessary ? Or is it up to the individual to see if they need to be included or not ? Many thanks, Hi, I am a student doing a report on why a company in should internationalise and needed some data on the market. Kind regards, Hi , I hope you are well and enjoying the festive period ! I was just wondering; would you be around on the of to review my essay (on the Module) with me on a team's meeting ? I ask just as it seems on at least you have no hours on that day, and i was wondering if that was the case still. 16:00 would be ideal for me on that but if you cannot then please do tell me your availability.

{"id": "aug_375", "anchor": "Employee relations is a socio-economic exchange between employer and employee with an agreement set regarding the latter\u2019s labour power and capacity to work. (Blyton, Turnbull 2004) Employment relations examines and analyses the various dimensions of this employee-employer relationship. The impact of employee relations has a huge impact on the UK as there are approximately 32.6 million people (ONS, November 2020) employed in the country. Government as a body plays a central role in employment relations to meet the economic and social goals of the country. The Government, who help to shape and intervene with employment relations have continually formulated new regulations and laws which affect all parties of the employment relations. One of the roles Government has always held is economic manager, they are assigned to plan and manage national economic activities (Kaul, 1997) and deal with policies at both the macro and micro level, ensuring that the labour markets operates well. (Cowling, Mitchell 1997) The Government itself is an employer, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported in June 2019, there were 5.42 million people employed in the UK\u2019s public sector, accounting for 16.5% of all those in paid work. Gender equality is a worldwide issue, statistics show there have always been more men than women in the labor market. In 1971, 52.8% was the female employment rate in comparison to 92.1% of their counterpart. The gap has reduced drastically with figures from 2020 showing a female employment rate of 72.1% and a male employment rate of 78.4% (ONS), a reduction in difference of over 30%. Though the UK\u2019s statistics have improved massively, the council of foreign relations ranked the country 7th on women\u2019s economic participation around the world, ranking behind other western countries such as Australia and Canada. Though in the time since 1971, there has been massive developments in gender equality in the workplace, when comparing to the rest of the world we can see the UK has a lot of catching up to do to provide women the same economic opportunities as their male counterparts. This report will emphasize the UK Governments intervention on gender equality and the overall impact of this on the economy and employee relations. Introduction of new legislation by the UK in employment relations has been one of the interventions which has helped to improve the gender gap in the UK. The Equal Pay Act (1970) and the Sex Discrimination Act (1975) were revolutionary legislations which opened a door for women in the workplace; the two legislations helped the minority gender and stated that employers must ensure that there is no sex discrimination, direct or indirect. In 2002, Blair\u2019s Labour party introduced the right to request flexible working which would facilitate both work and caring responsibilities for women. The change continued with different Governments and in 2010 the Labour Government introduced the Equality act which focused on \u2018building a fairer Britain\u2019 and brought together previous anti-discrimination laws, into one single legislation. When addressing gender quality on International women\u2019s day, Boris Johnson stated that there is \u2018so much more to do to ensure gender equality\u2019 making us aware that the Government has and will continue to authorize different legislations to ensure that inequality is reduced from the workplace and instead, equality is made apparent. Participation of women in the UK labour market is increasing year on year; though the labour market remains dominated by men, the difference in the gap between men and women has reduced. In the first quartile of 2010, there was a female employment rate of women aged 16-64 of 65.6%, whilst the male employment rate for the same quartile was 74.9%, a difference of 9.3%. In comparison, in the first quarter of 2020, ONS reported 72.6% of women were in work whilst 79.8% of males were employed, a difference of 7.2%. The difference in the gap in between employment rates has seen over a 2% decrease in the past decade, with 2020 reporting the lowest data recorded. Women employment rate is at the highest it has ever been, despite the job loss consequences of the covid-19 pandemic which has seen many lose their job. A national survey named the Women and Employment survey, which interviewed 5588 women between the ages of 16-59 in the 1980\u2019s produced key findings including evidence that though women returned to work after having children, it modified their lifetime earnings drastically with data showing that if a women was to have two children, it would reduce her lifetime earnings by roughly half than if she had remained childless. (Martin, Roberts 2006) In the past few decades, we have seen that working mothers are able to balance both their work and home life, and having a job provides them with stimulation, and better feelings of themselves (Poduval and Poduval 2009). Few reasons why there has been an increase of mothers in the workforce is due to the forming of new legislations and regulations by the Government including but not limited to the Shared Parental Leave 2014 and the lone parent income and support and Equality act 2010. These have helped women to feel better represented and led to positive effects on women employment and bringing in women into the workplace, allowing them to juggle their career and their families. Change in state pension age has also had an impact on the rise of women in employment; older women will stay in work for longer than previous years; for them it will provide \u2018financial independence\u2019 and an \u2018opportunity to save for retirement\u2019 (Thompson, 2020) The recession in 2008 saw both men and women being made redundant leading to an overall decrease in employment; women faired better in this decrease though due to their form of employment. Although numbers of full-time women in employment decreased, there was an incline of workers in part-time positions with employment rates in the public sector areas of education and health, where women are more heavily represented seeing a growth of 300,000 jobs between 2008 and 2009 (Rubery and Raggerty, 2013) During the recession, organisations used the method of labour market flexibility; markets responded to the changing economic conditions by making their full-time employees redundant whilst recruiting additional part-time workers to decrease working costs whilst having employees still produce the same levels of work; many women took advantage of the opportunity and so we didn\u2019t see numbers of part-time female employment reduce. The Government permitted this labour market flexibility to continue to take the country\u2019s market back to steadiness (Bell and Blenchflower, 2010). To help support people get back into work; the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) introduced the Future Jobs Fund (FJF) in 2009 hoping to create jobs for those disadvantaged. By 2012, we saw the economy start to improve again but in the four years before this, in such challenging times, the Government should have looked to create interventions and ways to support all those who had been affected by the recession. Though there is the issue of more men in work then women, gender pay gap is another key problem in gender inequality. In April 2019, the Office of National Statistics reported a gender pay gap of 17.4%, stating that in higher positions, there was a much larger difference in pay between the two genders compared to lower paid positions. When women enter the Labour market in low paid jobs, they are seen to rarely progress up, instead in a \u2018sticky floor\u2019 position, for men though, these jobs are seen as \u2018springboards\u2019 for them into higher paid positions. Government intervention in the form of legislations and policies help to reduce this dichotomy; the introduction of the flexible working act in 2014 and the Children and Family act (2014) meant that women could balance their families and responsibilities they have out of work. The flexible working act however stated that employees only have the right to request a change in working times after completing 26 weeks of employment. The Hampden Alexander review, supported by the Government set a minimum 33% target for women on the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 boards and the two divisions of leadership below this who would publish annual reports on gender pay gap too. Olsen et al (2018) found that women who do part time work tend to have higher quality jobs then men who work part time but that in the Labour market history, a driver for the pay gap, there was a 56% difference in the way men and women participate, 43.6% of this accounted for by the fact that men usually have a lot more experience in working full-time than women. According to equal pay act 2010, organisations had to publish six calculations including the mean and median gender pay gap in hourly pay every year (EHRC, 2020). In 2015, this voluntary reporting was made mandatory, however till today, this report publishing is not completely affective, in 2019, the equality human rights commission wrote to 47 organisations to make them aware formal investigations will begin due to their failure of reporting. Though the Law requires all organisations to report the gender pay gap, there is no requirement to reduce the pay gap, and though through the years we\u2019ve seen gender pay gap slowly start to decrease, it is still very much apparent. The Civil Service itself, reported a gender pay gap of 11.1% in 2019, showing us that the issue is apparent, even in the public sector. The Government should have ensured that the policies they passed effected the sectors that they control and reduced completely the gender pay gap for those in such roles, this way other companies would have followed from a long time ago. The Government has established a few interventions to help control gender inequality. The introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1998 meant all workers would be paid a certain amount for the work they performed. The 2016 National Living Wage (NLW) added to this but specifically for those over 25; the introduction of both meant that women, who were traditionally always paid lower than men would be entitled to the same minimum wage. Personnel today predicted in 2015 that the introduction of the NLW would mean that 13 of female workers would receive a pay rise by the end of the decade due to the policy. Another intervention introduced was the establishment of the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2007 (EHRC) which saw to protect people\u2019s rights and ensure fairness and equality; the Government provides funding for the company and works with it when progressing human rights. EHRC has helped millions of people since it was started up but in 2016 saw devastating cuts to its funding, its 2007 budget of \u00a370million was to be cut down to an estimated \u00a318million in 2020. This lack of funding and decreased budget would have very negative consequences on gender inequality; EHRC would not be able to function as broadly as it did before, equality would not be monitored and maintained as efficiently as previous years. In the UK, the State has passed legislations and regulations in the hope to bring about gender equality. They have also established different bodies to help combat this. The equality act 2010, though one of the most important legislations to help bring about diversity and equality in the workplace, 10 years on, still sees significant gaps in employment of men and women. The gender pay gap which has been slowly decreasing, sees a higher pay gap between the two genders in more senior roles; discouraging women to try and climb up company ladders. Government should have stricter rules on closing the gender pay gap not only in lower paid roles but higher ones too, encouraging women to be ambitious in themselves. An introduction for a NLW for more vulnerable women such as single mothers should be introduced as they may struggle than most with the set NLW, better flexible working arrangements should also be made possible in all types of organisations, not just after a 26 weeks\u2019 tenure. There should also be stricter repercussions on business\u2019 which fail to report their gender pay gaps as a few not following guidelines could see knock-on effects on other organisations doing the same. Though the Government is doing much to fight gender inequality, as a lawmaker, manager of economy and an employer, it has a long way to go to completely diminish the issue.", "positive": "s so nice aswell Yes my darling If I was a colour what colour would I be Hmmmm interesting What do you wanna do Shall I send you over my ones ?

Alternatively, if needs be we can cut our trip short and fund travel back to the UK for our members so we could be available on . This would have significant financial implications for us so would not be ideal but is a possibility if the presentations can be arranged on that date.

{"id": "aug_380", "anchor": "Subjective Expected Utility theory is a normative theory of decision making (Neumann &amp; Morganstern, 1944; Savage, 1954). There are five axioms of SEU theory, first there is a preference for decisions to be well ordered so between two options, there should be a preference. The second axiom is preferences should be transitive so if summer is preferred over winter and winter over spring then summer should be preferred over autumn. The third axiom is if there is an indifference between two options, the probability of them being chosen is equal. Fourth is if there is a preference for one option over another so A over B, if presented with two outcomes where one is the first choice leads to A and the second to B, the first option should be chosen. The last axiom is no alternative is infinitely better than any other. These axioms must be fulfilled to assign utilities to outcomes so the expected utility in any decision can be maximised. From the five axioms, the principle of transitivity is derived which is having a preference of option x to y and y to z leading to a preference of x to z. However, Tversky\u2019s (1969) found that preferences are not always transitive and therefore goes against the SEUT. To account for the violations of the SEU theory the Prospect theory (Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979) was proposed which explains that decision making is based upon personal gains and loss aversions. Therefore, predicting the potential decision to be chosen is difficult due to the probability of the decision being picked being distorted as probabilities are over weighted. Deviations can also be explained by regret theory which found that large differences are over weighted whilst small differences between outcomes are underweighted. Regret theory is also based upon emotions such as disappointment, rejoicing, regret and elation which are anticipated when a result of a decision is known. How the amount of this emotion does not reflect the difference between outcomes accurately.", "positive": "Hotel- Rantapuisto on trip advisor, \u00c2\u00a389 a night close by to the beach, able to get a sea view room too.

You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work. Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders? To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant\u2019s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC. Procedural requirements Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline. If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is \u00a352,000, any award exceeding \u00a325,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal. I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed. Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute. If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim? You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects, as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder\u2019s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. WDC Prospect It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee\u2019s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover. In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks\u2019 notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks\u2019 notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks\u2019 worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. UDC Prospect It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal\u2019s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. Applying this, WW may use \u2018other substantial reason,\u2019 ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be \u2018misconduct,\u2019 regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years. Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option? Please find below a list of options available to you. Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder\u2019s behaviour. Advantages: \u2022 You continue to have a regular job and income. \u2022 No stress about finding alternative work. \u2022 Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. Disadvantage: \u2022 Narinder\u2019s disrespectful behaviour may not change. \u2022 The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder\u2019s behaviour. Advantages: \u2022 Same as Option 1. \u2022 WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder\u2019s behaviour. \u2022 WW may assign you a new line manager. Disadvantage: \u2022 Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. Advantages: \u2022 Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. Disadvantage: \u2022 Same as Options 1-2. Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. Advantages: \u2022 You will be free from Narinder\u2019s treatment. \u2022 You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them. \u2022 You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. Disadvantages: \u2022 You will be unemployed after your notice period. \u2022 Stressful finding another job. Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC. Advantages: \u2022 You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. \u2022 You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour. \u2022 Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity. Disadvantages: \u2022 Same as Option 4. \u2022 There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim? WDC The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks\u2019 worth salary (\u00a310,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately \u00a34,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (\u00a31,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your \u2018Christmas [bonus]\u2019 regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual \u2018right[s] to receive.\u2019 Currently, you have taken two days\u2019 leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days\u2019 worth salary (\u00a33,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. Your compensation totals \u00a319,263.96. This includes notice salary (\u00a310,000), Pension (\u00a34,000), untaken leave (\u00a33,703.96) and Christmas bonus (\u00a31,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals \u00a317,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals \u00a311,763.96 or \u00a310,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal\u2019s maximum award of \u00a325,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. UDC The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. Basic Award Tribunal will award you \u00a36,300 based on your weekly gross salary (\u00a3525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. Compensatory Award The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (\u00a378,000), as it is below \u00a386,444 cap. This may be lower (\u00a325,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job. If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (\u00a384,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this. The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. Additional information Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract. Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. Yours Sincerely,", "positive": ", Thank you for letting me know. I did initially think this would be the case.

{"id": "aug_391", "anchor": "Middle managers have four main roles within an organization that they are tasked with in order to bring the firm success. Good middle managers should be sense makers of strategy and so explain and simplify what the strategic goals of the firm are, adaptors of strategy and so react to changes in the industry environment. They should also be local leaders meaning that they lead and direct those on lower levels to them while also being champions of strategic issues, going around the firm resolving and communicating the relevant issues to top management. A critical role of middle managers in strategy is sense making, as detailed in a report by Burgelman (1983) they shape the strategy of internal development and give form to the directives given from above, the Top Managers. Middle managers are the ones most directly involved with the people, products &amp; diversified groups and are therefore the impetus with which the strategy of an organisation can be implemented and developed, giving them great importance and relevance. Middle managers are also implementors of strategy, one that has been developed and created by top managers, they allow for the testing of the possible flaws and failings of what has been handed down to them. Subsequently it is the middle managers again that have the responsibility and need to synthesize the information they receive while disseminating it to the top as well as operating level managers in order to facilitate the flow of information in the firm (Kuratko, 2005). This highlights the importance of middle level managers in the firm as they are in the perfect position to keep information going both ways and are able to connect top management to the lower levels of the firm which are normally very disconnected. As a result, at often times middle managers will need to \u2018sell\u2019 key issues to top management, persuading them to commit to resolving certain strategic issues they deem necessary to address. If middle level managers cannot attract the attention of senior management to fix and improve strategy this could lead to the ultimate demise of the company as a whole. The eventual downfall of the mobile giant Nokia can in part be attributed to the failings of the middle managers, and the obstacles put in their way that prohibited them from completing their role as communicators and implementors of strategy. The middle managers were technological experts, the managers and their teams had a deep understanding of Symbian, the software Nokia used, it\u2019s faults and flaws. This best placed them to give advice on what was and what wasn\u2019t working, however the Nokia case study provides a perfect example of when communication isn\u2019t open and positive and the aftereffects. Due to the atmosphere of fear and lack of openness, most middle managers were hesitant to mention their true feelings and communicate the problems to the top (Vuori &amp; Huy, 2016). This meant that the middle managers weren\u2019t able to fulfil their roles, and Nokia\u2019s fall illustrated that without them the business could not function cohesively as a unit. One of the evident issues within Nokia was that there was a great lack of trust from the Top management to the lower levels, and this trust needed to be tangible for middle managers to keep an open dialogue with senior management. In order for information to flow from the lower levels to the upper levels of an organisation trust and a sense of ontological security is necessary, middle managers need to feel like they can openly disclose failures and mistakes with top management, however this wasn\u2019t the case in Nokia. In addition, this trust was to be harboured by top management and it was their responsibility to reduce the fear that failure would lead to punishment (Mantere, S. 2008), instead instigating and encouraging a culture of openness with a sense of security. This culture of fear of failure was not something that could be amended by middle managers but needed action from top management. Since the early 1990\u2019s this high-pressured culture was reinforced with social and economic sanctions, which, as time moved on, further demotivated middle managers to present the real problems that were occurring within the organisation, leading to skewed information flows between the lower and higher levels. The literature indicates that the motivation to sell issues to top management is based on the organisational context of the firm, the theory of Issue-selling intention as explained by Yan Ling et al. (2005) clearly highlights the underlying issues within Nokia\u2019s management. The theory details three contextual cues that motivate middle managers to sell issues to top management: Perceived organisational support, top management\u2019s open mindedness and relationship quality. Albeit none of these were present in Nokia. The first factor, perceived organisational support, is when employees feel safe selling issues to senior management either formally or informally. However, some at the top in Nokia were described as \u2018extremely temperamental\u2019 and seen at often times as intimidating, threatening to fire those that made mistakes, creating a hostile environment in the firm disincentivizing middle managers to sell issues. This exacerbated the other contextual cue of relationship quality, given the perceived aggression from top management the relationship between the different levels could not be trusting nor friendly and resultantly gave middle managers no reason to say things that the top would not want to hear. This would not lead to imminent problems, as seen by Nokia\u2019s continued growth during this period, although it did lead to a sense of conformity overtime disallowing middle managers to have a positive impact on Nokia\u2019s strategic decision making. The theory of Issue-selling intention clearly defines that it should be top management facilitating an ease of communication and instigating a sense of security with bringing forward problems present in the firm. The key underlying issue was the oppressive and domineering culture present at Nokia which created a chasm between top and middle level management. Given that this culture had been present for more than a decade top management should have taken action, slowly opening more channels of communication between the middle and top levels while assuring support for those that did come forward. To anyone working for Nokia it was clear that what top management said could not be refuted, being critical was not a part of the corporate culture and there were fierce repercussions threatened for those that spoke out of line. Within this context, middle managers needed to thread the needle and influence strategic direction in a way that wouldn\u2019t cause friction with top management. One of these ways could have been issue bundling, where the middle managers would try to tie their issues with already agreed-upon goals so as to highlight the importance of their issue to top management in a way that could not be overlooked (Dutton et al., 2001). Middle management could for example try tying their issues to valued goals such as profitability and in this way increase the likelihood of having their issue addressed. This would have been a potent way for middle managers to get senior management to take action on issues that were very evident but not brought up for fear of being reprimanded. In addition to this bundling of issues, another way in which middle level management could influence strategy and implement change would be through the collaboration and wider involvement of employees in selling the issues. Communication did not flow upwards within Nokia, but it did flow horizontally within those at the same level and middle level managers discussed openly the choices they made and reports they gave top management. As a result of collaboration with likeminded individuals, the middle managers would be able to win internal allies and accumulate internal influence (Wickert, C. et al., 2018). In turn managers would feel more empowered and confident to critique the top management\u2019s instructions, which overtime would change the corporate culture and create a more open dialogue within the business. Therefore, middle level managers could have brought their issues to the top easier if they turned to each other for support as they knew of the problems plaguing the business but were too intimidated to bring them forward. On the contrary, whatever change to come about would take time to implement, as shown on the theory of \u2018The transition curve\u2019. The first two phases of this theory capture the difficulty of individuals letting go of the past and coming to terms with the need for change (Balogun et al., 2016). As depicted on the theory, it would take a lot of courage to go against the corporate culture and begin to criticise top management knowing the risks that this would entail and would then lead to lower self-confidence of the managers. A caveat however would be that this theory solely focuses on the individual, and forgets the effect of the collective, which in this case would be great given the change undertaken to influence strategy would be done by all the middle managers, cohesively. The Nokia case study illustrates the rise and fall of a global market leader and highlights the difficulties of maintaining success in the face of an ever-changing external environment. Firms need to be able to move with the times so as to not be left behind. If there are parts of the firm, especially core competencies, that aren\u2019t working as well as they once did then the firm needs to put it behind them and move on. Incumbents are often \u2018overthrown\u2019 when they cannot recognise the threat posed by disruptive innovation and instead continue with the converse of sustaining innovation (Schmidt, G.M., 2008). This was most certainly the case with Nokia, it had invested so much in its own software Symbian that there could be no doubts about its longevity and top management continually asked to incrementally update and change it. This was a key mistake, however, as not only was the software old fashioned as compared to the newer and improved IOS systems, but it was also very difficult to work with. The fact that Nokia tried to force Symbian to work for so long is in part what led it to its eventual demise. Instead, the firm should have cut out Symbian as soon as it stopped producing results and moved on with radical OS innovation that the firm so sorely needed in order to face the increasing competition. This in turn would have reduced pressure on the software organisation and given them the time necessary to produce a quality product instead of rushing results just to meet deadlines. Overtime this lack of transformational change will cause a business to become less and less in touch with the ever-changing demands of consumers. The phenomenon of Strategic Drift will resultantly occur when a firm becomes less in line with the environment within which the organization operates (Johnson, G., 1992), this was the case with Nokia and can lead to a firms eventual demise. Incumbent firms use incremental change, continuing with the practices that have made them so successful in the past, until the reach a flux. At this point managers are unsure of what to do as they have fallen so far behind market trends and resultantly if they do not start transformational change then they may die. This theory can be useful for incumbent firms to recognise the faults that they can make but should be wary that the theory is not as simple as it seems. As in the Nokia case, it took a few years before the firm really started seeing the negative results from not adapting to the times and as a result the theory may be seen as too simplistic in truly addressing the heart of the issue. A final key point that incumbent firms could learn from Nokia is that they cannot become arrogant and must keep managers humble so as to mitigate the overestimation of one\u2019s capabilities. There was a lack of concern from the top, consistent within the middle levels of management that the iPhone was no threat to them. This sentiment arose from the feelings that the firm was invincible due to its market leadership and R&amp;D strength where it had invested over $50 billion over two decades.

{"id": "aug_393", "anchor": "Autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD) is a polygenic-neurodevelopmental-disorder characterised by three subsets of-deficits: social-impairments, communication impairments-and-repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a-minimum-of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American-Psychiatric-Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). The big 3 theories that attempt to explain the ASD profile are Theory of Mind (TOM), Executive Function Theory (EFT) and Weak Central Coherence (WCC), they are higher level theories as they focus on developmental differences in cognition rather than at a perceptual level. TOM looks at the ability to attribute mental-states to others as-well as yourself. A deficit of this ability in the ASD population is widely notarised in research tasks such as the Sally Ann and the Unexpected Contents tasks which was passed by around 20% of ASD-individuals compared to 86-96% in a neurotypical population (Baron-Cohen-et-al, 1985;Perner-et-al, 1989). Evidence of differences regarding TOM are also found in neuro-studies measuring brain activity, a study conducted by White et al, (2014) found ASD children showed similar atypical neuro-activity as non-ASD children with historical mentalizing-deficits. TOM is strong at explaining social impairments such as lack of shared enjoyment, socio-emotional reciprocity and also some communication-issues such as not picking up subtle cues in conversation (Kimhi, 2014). Overall, TOM suffers from two main limitations, even with differences in brain activity of core-TOM regions, it cannot explain social deficits completely as 20% still pass those tests mentioned and secondly, it fails to account one third of the ASD diagnostic triad: repetitive activities. On the other hand, EFT-is-concerned with-our-minds-attentional system, spatially located in the brains frontal lobes. It-is-based-specifically-on-the ability of novel idea generation, response inhibition, planning and cognitive flexibility (Diamond, 2012). The EFT attempts to explain ASD deficits both social and non-social, successfully in tasks such as the Wisconsin-Card-Sorting-Test, where cognitive flexibility-is-required-to-follow-different card-rules-linearly and ASD-individuals show lack of flexibility and high amounts of perseverative errors in set shifting, instead adhering to repetition of the old rule . A meta-analysis by Landry &amp; Al-Taie (2016) covering this topic spanned 30 years and found effect sizes of 0.30-0.74; all studies statistically significant. Furthermore, EFT attempts to explain other ASD behaviours such as lack of inhibition of prepotent-response which executive-functioning manages (Levy, 2007). Although this has mixed evidence, a study by Adams &amp; Jarrold (2012) showed ASD individuals have a deficit in distractor-inhibition related to perceptual processing rather than the prepotent response due to executive functioning. Last of the big 3, WCC, is explained in an updated model by Happe &amp; Frith (2006), describing ASD as an imbalance in data integration and a bias toward local elements over global rather than a deficit. This difference in processing style is strong at explaining issues with emotion recognition in faces, Lahaie et al (2006), found those with ASD could be primed toward arbitrary segments of the face as much as toward intuitive parts like the mouthnose. This bias-towards local elements is supported by Gross (2004) who-reported ASD individuals showing atypical patterns due to focusing on the lower regions of the face instead of the whole, this explains well issues of emotion recognition due to failure to process the whole face. The WCC\u2019s ability to explain restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) has also found support by Chen et al (2008) who found RRB associations with a detailed-focused processing style. Lastly, the WCC helps understanding the benefits having ASD-provides which neither of the other theories presented, such as better performance on embedded figures and block design tasks due to them requiring you to look for local elements that make-up the global (Shah-&amp;-Frith, 1983;1993). Conclusively, this short essay has attempted to weigh the ability of the big-3 theories in explaining the full clinical profile of ASD, the research shows none are able to. Either having mixed evidence in some areas or failing to account aspects of the profile entirely and even suffering from domain specificity, research found false-belief deficits in TOM only affected ASD individuals when the task was completed mentally vs. visual checks of physical differences (Perner &amp; Leekam, 2008). However, over time they can be developed further like the Empathising and Systemizing theory which attempts to build on TOM and explain non-social aspects (Baron-Cohen, 2009). Most importantly,-there is a positive to theories being independent to a restrictive global picture, ASD is multi-faceted and forcing a single picture is-unlikely to be representative-of everyone. Instead, is the idea of-fractionation, it shows the likelier picture of different theories being able to explain the-different domains-of the same impairments and the whole clinical profile being accounted for (Brunsdon-&amp;-Happe, 2013). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by 3 subsets of deficits: social impairments, communication impairments and repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a minimum of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). Lower-level processes such as percept of sensory modalities which are extremely important in those with ASD. Many aspects can be explained by the theory of Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) and it itself is an alternative to the WCC, the EPF focusses on difference in perceptual processing vs. WCC which focuses entirely on higher level cognitive processing instead. The EPF has a very broad range of research covering research on many different atypical behaviours in ASD, one being enhanced abilities in embedded figures, block-design and visual search tasks (Mottron &amp; Burack , 2001). These findings have mixed backings in research, it is supported by research on inhibition of prepotent responses which found Perceptual distractors were more inhibiting than prepotent responses (Adams &amp; Jarrold, 2011). Conversely, disputing evidence by Kaldy et al (2016) agreed with the idea that ASD individuals are better at these tasks but argue that it is instead due to deficitsdifferences in attentional networks. Explained due to behaviours in ASD such as overfocusing due to fixationpreoccupation in tasks and-restricted-interests which enable individuals to perform better in detail focused tasks. Nevertheless, the idea of enhanced percept is highly important in explaining savant skills as an example, where access to raw, less-processed information is manipulated for the benefit of ASD individuals, the EPF states savant skills deeply rooted by perceptual elements e.g. in drawingmusic (Motron et al, 2009). This co-aligns well with the fact that around 95% of ASD individuals experience sensory symptoms due to a perceptual differences both positive and negative (Tomchek &amp; Dunn, 2007), but explanations for hyposensitivity are still awry. Another explanation of atypical ASD behaviour is the social motivation theory by Chevallier (2012), it attempts to explain social deficits, specifically why there are social impairments. It concluded that due to lack of social interest, ASD children miss out on key opportunities to develop social skills and are socially impaired as a result. This is supported by Fletcher-Watson (2009) who found that when given a hybrid image of both social and non-social areas, those with ASD spend equal time in both and are less likely to have their first fixation on the social area. However, there is research that argues a stark contrast, instead in the favour of perceptual load. Research on object personification in ASD, found significant amounts of loneliness and object personification and reported an ASD need to personify objects as to alleviate social disconnection and isolation (White &amp; Remington, 2018). If ASD individuals do have social interest, then why are they socially impaired? Research on face-to-face interference by Riby et al (2012), found individuals with ASD when asked to maintain hold gaze had worse task performance, these findings lead to the idea that those with ASD are perceptually overloaded in social situations like holding gaze. Cyclically back to the inference from social motivation theory, those with ASD therefore avoid social situations in order to not feel overloaded. Both theories are able to successfully reason both socialcommunicative impairments and lend the idea that in the absence of social experience, ASD individuals are caught up in preoccupated behaviour. It\u2019s clear from this that there is a lot of research on ASD on both lower and higher level processes, and both equally can explain atypical behaviours shown in ASD individuals whether it by lack of developed social skills due to perceptual capacity or be social impairments due to deficits of TOMEFT. The fact remains that none of these theories can explain with unyielding evidence the full clinical profile of ASD and every atypical behaviours described (Mottron et al, 2006; Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). For example, albeit the mixed evidence, the EPF theory can successfully reason repetitive activities and some social impairments but can be outdone on the latter by TOM. However, regardless of which is correct, having a multi-faceted evidence base is a positive, it enables us to look at all angles of ASD rather than forcing a singular theory to explain all dimensions. Furthermore, doing so has led to good outcomes, such as revised updates to theories for their shortcomings such as the updated EPF theory by Mottron et al (2006),which added in the novel idea that higher order processing can be an optional pathway for those with ASD.", "positive": ", I do have some sort of timetable on now, I'm not sure if it was the team or not but I received an email yesterday saying that my timetable was released and following that it was working on .

Students would prefer to have smaller seminar groups with a seminar leader present so discussion can be encouraged by the leader and students then get more out of the activity sessions particularly in Quizzes - students felt like the small quizzes within the lectures were benefiting their learning by testing their learning as they go and would prefer if other modules adapted to this and imputed small quizzes within the lectures to test and consolidate students learning workshop sessions - some students were wanting the correct answers for the workshop sessions to be posted after the workshops, whether that be immediately after or a week after as students felt like they couldn't clarify whether they were getting the right answers and if they were entering the data into correctly as last year in the in-person sessions students could get their answers checked by the lecturer present Module Guides - Some students were feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information for the modules across different areas of and were requesting that modules take on a similar approach to modules by putting all the required reading for each week, the lectures to be completed that week and the assessment dates all into one document as a module guide so students can have that as a basic outline of their modules and the work to be completed to reduce the feelings of being overwhelmed Careers and placements - students felt positively about the support being provided by the placements team this year in such an unpredictable work climate - students felt positively about the change to software as it is easier to navigate and use Thats all the feedback I have collected off the second year students and hope to discuss this with you all in the meeting later Thanks Second Year Student", "positive": "h everyone\u2019s at work aren\u2019t they?x Either then or at 1 xx Okay xx I think I\u2019m gonna come a bit later cause working still xx Okay, what time you back from mamas xx Okay xx Are you coming?x Can you get mince out so I can make lasagne xx Come on Oi I\u2019m scared to start my exam Still waiting for to get the dogs and I\u2019m very nervous I\u2019m gonna do awful x I\u2019ve been invited to 's baby shower lol x Okay xx Ohhh it\u2019s on my chair xxx Yeah was there when they had it lol did he not say?x Just submitted my exam and now I\u2019m scared", "positive_attacked": "h everyone\u2019s at work aren\u2019t they?x Either then or at 1 xx Okay xx I think I\u2019m gonna come a bit later cause working still xx Okay, what time you back from mamas xx Okay xx Are you coming?x Can you get mince out so I can make lasagne xx Come on Oi I\u2019m scared to start my exam Still waiting for to get the dogs and I\u2019m very nervous I\u2019m gonna do awful x I\u2019ve been invited to 's baby shower lol x Okay xx Ohhh it\u2019s on my chair xxx Yeah was there when they had it lol did he not say?x Just submitted my exam and now I\u2019m scared", "label": 1}

{"id": "aug_411", "anchor": "Subsequent to losing the 1983 election on a hardline socialist programme, it became clear that a rebranding of the Labour Party was crucial. The term \"New Labour\" was initially coined by Tony Blair at the 1994 Labour Party Conference, inspired by sociologist Anthony Giddens who believed that it was important to find a \"third way\" between Thatcherism and traditional socialism. The question in hand explores the way in which the Labour Party\u2019s place on the political spectrum has changed through the complexities of several policies introduced over the years. In this essay, I will be assessing the extent to which the Labour Party has been redefined from the Blair-era over two decades ago, to Corbynism today. It is worthwhile dealing with the topic at hand as politics is a subject which needs to be continuously adapting to reflect changes in global dynamics, this topic in particular reveals how government policies develop to maintain dialogue and preserve stability in an increasingly fragile and threatened geopolitical system. Blair\u2019s creation of New Labour attempted to formulate an alternative to traditional social democracy and free-market neo-liberalism in the context of a modern globalised economy. This neo-revisionism advocated a balance of rights and responsibilities, resulting in communitarian liberalism which emphasised that personal autonomy operates within a communal context based on mutual dependence and benefit. As Brown\u2019s government ensured no radical breakaway from New Labour, ideals and principles of the Labour Party remained the same for many years. However, it is important to note that the Labour government\u2019s failures in the early 21st century appear to have fundamentally changed voters\u2019 views on whether Labour can be trusted on the economy, leading to a Conservative victory in the 2010 general election. This is largely significant as throughout the recent years, the Labour Party seems to have adopted more socialist principles, evident in Corbyn\u2019s left-wing agenda. Therefore, I aim to argue that the Labour party has evolved to a large extent over the years due to many successes and failures of the party leaders\u2019 policies. In this essay I have used a range of books, websites and JSTOR journals. Previously published academic works include New Labour Hard Labour? Restructuring and resistance in the welfare industry by Gerry Mooney and Alex Law, as well as books such as Leadership and the Labour Party by John Gaffney. In these sources, the key concepts are focussing on New Labours\u2019 appeal to the masses and rebranding of the party. These journals and books gave clear statistics taking an innovative approach as well as differing opinions on the main policies which redefined the Labour Party which provided useful insight and information. To gain better understanding of the authors to ensure reliability of my resources I also did some prior research on them. There were many crossovers to other academic disciplines such as economics and history, especially when researching Blair and Brown\u2019s economic policies there were many statistics and economic theory. However, there were also weaknesses in the sources I used such as the author\u2019s personal opinion being a large influence. After four general election defeats, the Labour Party realised that traditional class-based political ideas and concepts were no longer seen as acceptable by the British electorate. As a result, the New Labour governments aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations, by conserving resources before investing more in key public services. Blair modernised the Labour party to appeal more to middle-class voters by moving away from traditional policies such as nationalisation and emphasising constitutional reform. \u2018Clause IV\u2019 of the party constitution was abandoned, ties with trade unions were loosened and the party moved away from its previously hard-left position. Labour also became more pro-European as the EU adopted policies that protected workers\u2019 rights such as the Social Chapter, and the Third way brought market models to some government-run services and aroused interest across the western world. Labour policies were largely based around the free-market, which was accepted as the best form of wealth creation with further privatisation and reduced corporate taxes to encourage enterprise. Greater emphasis was placed on individualism and communitarianism with the belief that the individual should realise their own potential and that everyone has a responsibility to care for the community collectively. Moreover, \"as part of its wider reform of the welfare and modernisation agendas, New Labour [had] sought to emphasise the role and responsibilities of family and community in the provision of welfare services\" (Mooney, 2007). Here it is evident that the sole focus of neo-revisionism was essentially a Labour rebranding exercise to appeal to the masses and attract business interests following four consecutive UK general election defeats, it introduced important measures that promoted social justice and improved the position of the most disadvantaged in society. The government had aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations and had done so very well. This rebranded party proved to be largely successful for the first few years and the idea of the \"Third way\" appealed largely to the masses, however over time, Blair\u2019s popularity began to decline. Although the Conservatives lost the 2001 election, they persisted in arguing that New Labour wasn\u2019t delivering its policy promises. This began to prove effective as there was a significant fall in the number of people who expected service delivery to either get better or much better over the next few years as \"healthcare by September 2003 8 per cent fewer people expected the NHS to \u2018get better\u2019 over the following year. At the same time, the government\u2019s satisfaction ratings fell sharply from a 54 per cent in September 2001, to 36 per cent in September 2002 and 25 per cent in September 2003\" (Hindmoor, 2005). There are many reasons as to why this happened, the main being the tragedy of Iraq which ensnared him so completely that by Summer of 2007 he had acknowledged he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. It is believed that \"Iraq [had] come to dominate the Blair legacy to such an extent that many of his notable achievements \u2013 the Good Friday agreement, devolution to Scotland and Wales, the minimum wage and a number of social reforms are doomed to shelter under its shadow\" (BBC News, 2019). As a combined result of the Blair\u2013Brown pact, Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour Party for Blair to resign and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election. The Financial crisis and recession of 2008-09 led to a minor shift in policy by the Brown government but still maintained a majority of the New Labour values and principles. Gordon Brown had primacy over vast areas of domestic policy and handled the banking collapse, as the unpopularity of the Iraq war had meant that a new focus was needed for the party. In its foreign policy choices, the Brown government was quite similar to that of Tony Blair\u2019s as it \"displayed the same unshakeable Atlanticism, pronounced Euroscepticism, and commitment to increasing international aid to 0.7% of gross national income as its coalition successor\" (Lee, 2019). In both health and education, \"Brown continued the Blair governments\u2019 pattern of top-down reorganisation of hospitals and schools, and the increasing use of private sector finance and organisations to deliver services\" (Lee, 2019). He supported increased spending on hospitals, pledged to make reform of the NHS a major priority and also promised to retain the public-sector reforms implemented by Blair. In domestic policy terms, the impact of devolution meant that the Brown government\u2019s capacity to reform public services was confined to England, where Brown had no personal democratic mandate to intervene. Although, Brown retained a vast majority of Blair\u2019s policies, he set out plans to decentralise Britain and make good the more evident weaknesses of Blairism, not least its careless disregard for civil liberties. However, two developments quickly derailed the new prime minister\u2019s hopes. In \"August 2007 the first cracks appeared in the international banking system, cracks that would lead to the run on the Northern Rock bank the first run on a bank in Britain for 150 years \u2013 and its eventual nationalisation by New Labour \u2013 an irony after years of pro-business rhetoric\" (White, 2019). After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a recession in 2008 leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. Brown had broken an earlier promise not to raise income tax levels by creating a new 50% band, to be paid by those who earned more than \u00a3150,000 a year which led to claims that New Labour ideology had been abandoned. Despite a Conservative rule, Ed Miliband struggled to balance his more left-wing views with a desire to appeal to the centre ground. Under his leadership the Labour Party maintained some elements of New Labour policies, while shifting slightly to the left. The new leader called for the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax and the need to re-establish Labour\u2019s reputation as a competent manager of the economy was an important concern for Miliband. He tried to combine New Labour\u2019s support for business with the defence of the party\u2019s core working-class constituency by drawing a distinction between what he called \u2018predatory\u2019 and \u2018responsible capitalism. At the 2015 election Miliband pledged to reduce the deficit every year of the next parliament. He insisted that Labour\u2019s spending plans would be paid for without additional borrowing. \"Miliband [pledged] to fund the NHS improvements with a mansion tax on properties worth over \u00a32m. other tax pledges include the restoration of the 10p tax band for low earners\" (The Independent, 2019). However, by 2015 there was pressure from the left of the party for Labour to adopt a much more radical approach. Some party member attributed the landslide victory of the SNP in Scotland, where Labour was left with just one Westminster seat, to the party being insufficiently left wing. \"Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two\" (BBC News, 2019). Jeremy Corbyn sinisterly told photographers and journalists \"under Socialism you will all cooperate\" (Express.co.uk, 2019) suggesting a radical shift to the left. He took the Miliband-balls idea of increased investment in the economy further, calling for large-scale funding of industry and infrastructure organised by a National Investment Bank. He called for the renationalisation of the railways, a policy the New Labour governments refused to adopt. Instinctively supporting intervention of an Old Labour kind, he demanded that companies publish pay audits with the aim of countering discrimination in the workplace. \"Labour has pledged to rejuvenate the UK's neglected high streets, nationalize public services and some major industries, and force all large firms to give their employees a share of the business and a voice on their boards. Critics of Labour say these policies are throwbacks to failed socialist governments of the 1970s\" (Vonberg, 2019). Like Miliband, he favoured the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax. However, Corbyn was much more clear-cut in his competition to austerity, characterising it as a political choice that harmed the most vulnerable members of society, rather than an economic necessity. Many bold claims have been made about Corbyn with \"Corbyn may not be a Communist, but he\u2019s certainly a Marxist\" (The Northern Echo, 2019) being one of the boldest. Corbyn strongly opposed benefit cuts and a socialist he regarded the poor as the victims of capitalism, who are entitled to public support. He opposed the use of the private sector to deliver public services \u2013 a central aspect of New Labour. Thus, he argued for a wholly state-run NHS. In order to promote lifelong education and training, he called for a national education service, and opposed student tuition fees. By contrast, Ed Miliband had confined himself to advocating their reduction from \u00a39,000 to \u00a36,000 a year. In terms of law and order policy, Corbyn was opposed to the more hard-line policies of the New Labour era, such as increased powers to combat terrorism and the introduction of identity cards. This became a less controversial policy area within the labour party \u2013 both Blairites and Corbynites found common ground in opposing government cuts to police number. Corbyn consistently voted against the use of force and favoured the withdrawal of the UK from NATO\u2019s military structure and the abolition of the Trident nuclear weapons system, again placing him at odds with New Labour. `He followed the mainstream of his party in supporting continued British membership of the EU, emphasising its positive role in protecting workers\u2019 rights. In conclusion, it is evident that the Labour Party had been redefined to a large extent, beginning as a more centrist party in 1997 and eventually becoming a more radical socialist party in present day. Through several policy failures, the Labour Party established that it needed to rebrand itself once again to adapt to current affairs. It is evident that Gordon Brown maintained a large amount of the New Labour principles however, Ed Miliband realised that this new and reformed party wasn\u2019t going to get them through the 2015 election.

{"id": "aug_412", "anchor": "Assessing Attitudes Towards Zoos Introduction: This study\u2019s hypothesis is that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos would have a wide variation. This is because some participants may have a positive attitude due to their involvement in conserving species, and some a negative attitude due to animal captivity. Reade and Waran (1996) support this, stating that zoo visitors have positive perceptions of zoos whereas members of the general public have negative views. Method: Positive and negative statements about zoos were pooled in which 10 of each were selected for the pilot study (Appendix 1), which recruited 10 participants. Negative statement scores were then reversed, so that negative attitudes equate to low scores, and vice versa. To assess the internal validity of the pilot questionnaire, each participant\u2019s scores were totalled (see Appendix 3), and the 4 highest and lowest scored participants were selected. The 4s and 5s selected by positive and negative participants were compared to assess whether an item was discriminatory. Statements differing in scores between these participants fit into such criteria. 4 discriminatory positive and negative statements were selected for the main study (Appendix 2). The 10 original participants were recruited for this version, along with a further 10. The totals of each original participant were compared between the pilot and main study (Appendix 4) to assess the questionnaire\u2019s reliability. Total scores of all participants were then calculated (Appendix 5). Results: The internal validity test (Appendix 3) showed that 11 statements were discriminatory: 4 negative, and 7 positive. The lowest scores ranged from 41 to 45, while the highest ranged from 55 to 69. These participants reported either the most negative or positive attitudes respectively. Only two participants produced the same score when completing the pilot study and the main study (Appendix 4). A Spearman\u2019s Rho test found that there was a significantly strong correlation between the test and re-test scores (rs = .838, p &lt; .01). 90% of participants scored higher in the pilot study compared to the main study. 3 of the 4 positive statements had standard deviations (SD) over 1 (Appendix 2), meaning that there was a wider variation of responses to these, whilst negative statements had SDs less than 1. The statement with the lowest SD was positive (SD = .489), whilst the highest was negative (SD = 1.268). As the hypothesis suggested, participants had a wide variation of scores (M = 22.4, SD = 4.297), ranging from 16 to 28 (Appendix 5). This SD indicates a large spread of data across the mean. Conclusion: The results of Appendix 3 showed that there was high internal validity since the positive and negative statements differed in scores by participants, suggesting that the questionnaire measures what it was set out to measure. The Spearman\u2019s Rho test showed that the questionnaire had high test-retest reliability as results from participants were similar in the pilot compared to the main study (Appendix 4). The larger SD of the final responses of the positive statements indicate that the results are widely spread across the mean, while the smaller SDs for the negative statements suggest that there was less of a variation in responses to these. Therefore, it can be concluded that participant\u2019s attitudes towards zoos do not have a wide variation, as participant\u2019s responses were polarised, with a smaller variance in responses with negative statements compared to positive.", "positive": "the link to the survey does not appear to be working.

Kind RegardsBeste Gr\u00fc\u00dfe Dear , Hope you are well and keeping safe. I've just had a chat with one of my mentee's who is quite stressed and I just wanted to raise a few concerns regarding placements following my conversation with her. There were a few things that I noted from the conversation including: She felt that she hasn't been given enough sufficient guidance and support from the placements team and correspondence about what placements she should be looking for and when she did try to make an appointment with the placements team, she said that she was told the wrong things. She said that she was told that she could apply for non-international placements so had been looking for placements only based on these criteria to then be told that she must complete an international placement. Furthermore, in the initial appointment she had been told that she would have some placement suggestions to be sent to her which never happened. She said that she feels that she is in the dark about the whole year abroad experienceprocess of application and this has made her really stressed about it. I have told her to make another appointment with the placements team which she has done and to raise all of this in the appointment and how she feels and then to let me know how she gets on. I just felt that it was important for you to know and to also help improve the assistance given by the placements team as this was really worrying to hear as a mentor.

I wanted to know if you had any specific information about how the assessment for this module will run for the summer deferral? For example, Will the question be different? Also, do you know the exact date of the deferral, or when I would be able to find out? Lastly, I really did enjoy this module and your delivery of it, it\u2019s just a shame that things were not the best for me, and that circumstances meant we could not meet on campus.

{"id": "aug_415", "anchor": "Abstract: This experiment investigates the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) using a cued visual attention task through an electroencephalogram (EEG). The predictions for this study are that alpha activity would be higher for the left parietal lobe in the cue left (Cl) condition rather than cue right (Cr). 39 psychology students performed visual attention task and were cued to expect the stimulus on either the right or left. This study found that the left condition did have higher alpha amplitudes in comparison to the right condition when recording for P3. The findings for this study supported previous research and found that in conclusion the alpha inhibition is indicative of attention. Introduction: \u2018High alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas\u2019 (Kilesch 2007) and is also reduced in task relevant brain areas. The findings of Handel et al (2011) showed that the stimuli presented to the participants visually were processed on the opposite side of the brain to where the stimuli were, and it is contralateral to the unattended side showing significantly higher alpha power. The results show that if a stimulus was to be presented on the left-hand side, it will be processed on the right side of the brain. A study by Sauseng et al (2005) which is being partially replicated by this study, asked participants to conduct a cued visual attention task and focused on different regions of the brain. The participants responded to a stimulus on a screen after being presented with an arrow that was an indication of which side the stimulus would appear on. The results show the side of the brain in which the stimuli had been processed, will obtain less alpha. There was also a significant effect of cue 200ms prior to stimulus onset recording from P3. These studies all show that alpha activity will be higher on the ipsilateral side in which the stimuli is shown, this supports the AIH. Therefore, supporting studies suggest that the hypothesis for this study is that the alpha amplitude would be higher in the Cl than the Cr, when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe. Method: Participants: A total of 39 undergraduate psychology students volunteered to be a participant, they were split into 5 groups. Design: The study was a repeated measures design as each participant saw both Cl and Cr conditions. The independent variable is the direction of the cue consisting of 2 levels whether it was left or right, and the dependant variable is the alpha amplitudes measured in microvolts (\u03bcV). Materials: Data was collected using a Biopac MP360. EEG electrodes were used, and AC cream was applied to help with the conductivity and reduce impedance. Everi cream to reduce skin impedance. PsychoPy is used to provide the stimuli and an event marker is sent to the Biopac. A large and small bar stimulus (figure 1a and 1b) in which participants focus their attention to. And arrow cues letting the participants know which side the stimulus will appear on, symbolised by the keys &lt; and &gt;. Procedure: The Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35 Hz and channels are set up to allow the left and right cue event markers to be accessed through PsychoPy, the event markers were used to identify when the stimuli were presented. Another channel is set up to record activity from the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz), the sampling rate was 1000 Hz; 1000 observations recorded per second. The experimenter explained the objective to the participant and consent was given before proceeding, electrodes were then put into place. Following the \u20181020 system positioning\u2019 the active electrode is placed on the P3 site on the left side of the parietal lobe in the brain. The reference electrode is placed at Fz and the earth electrode is placed by the participants hairline. Impedance checks are then done and were kept below 10KOhms. Instructions were presented on the screen for the participants to follow, stating that a cue will appear indicating which side the stimulus will appear on; left or right. A fixation cross appeared in the centre then followed by a stimulus of a bar either large or small. Participants were then told to press a specific key depending on which bar was presented e.g., \"L\" for large bar and \"S\" for small bar. Practice trials were completed first to allow them to test run the experiment and understand what they are being asked to do. Participants took part in 4 different conditions with 3 repeats so a total of 12 practice trials. Once completed feedback was given to the participants. Similarly, to the practice trial, participants then took part in the real trial containing 20 blocks of 4 trials in which 50% of the trials cued left and 50% cued right all in a randomised order. In total there was 80 experimental trials. The cues were presented on the screen for 35ms. Then followed by a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) this is set for 200ms to 1200ms. An event marker is then sent at the onset of the stimulus and the stimulus was then displayed for 50ms. Participants then proceed to respond. During the study the experimenters explained to the participant what the task was, they put the electrodes in place and proceeds to the impedance test, then the experimenter begins the experiment for the participant to complete. The experimenter recorded the data which was then followed by debriefing the participant about the aims of the study. The experimenter helped to clean up the participant then proceeded to analyse the data that was recorded. Participants had to read the instructions that appeared before starting the experiment and follow these instructions by pressing certain keys and focusing on what appears on the screen. Data treatment: When the experiment is running, event markers were sent to the computer, then to the biopac. This records exactly when the stimuli were presented, this allows the period 200ms before stimulus onset to be analysed for the Cl and Cr condition. The raw alpha data were then rectified regardless of it being either excitatory or inhibitory. This meant that any negative values were converted to positive values and an average deviation from 0\u03bcV was produced. The data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce extreme values. These data then become rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA). Results: Table 1 shows the results for 38 participants as one participant withdrew from the experiment, so no data is provided. A Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to test whether the data was parametric or non-parametric. As the p value was less than .05, a non-parametric test was carried out. The median RAAA indicates that the Cl condition had higher alpha amplitude compared to the CR condition at the P3 site. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T= 566, n= 38, p= .002). Discussion: The findings support the hypothesis that there is greater alpha amplitude when the stimuli are Cl then when the stimuli are Cr. Our results are consistent with the AIH and Sauseng et al as alpha activity is contralateral to the side it is processed, and our results showed there was less alpha activity contralateral to the stimuli where the visual stimuli had been processed. This suggest that the side of the brain that is not involved with attention has less alpha activity. A methodological problem of this study is that attention could have been redirected due to being in a distracting environment in which multiple other students were talking. Evidence from previous research (Garrison &amp; Williams 2013) shows that participants do not perform as well when distracted and are more likely to make common mistakes when taking part in a task. To gain more accurate results these limitations will need to be controlled such as being in an environment with minimal noises, therefore helping the participant to focus better.", "positive": "Ms , hope you have had a nice holiday and I wish you luck for .

{"id": "aug_419", "anchor": "Introduction The topic of research I decided to study is why it\u2019s mostly students who take Humanities and social sciences degrees; specifically, Psychology students, who are interested in East Asian cultures such as Korean culture. This is an interesting topic to explore because me personally and people around me, have experience of studying Psychology and being a part of Korean society and the Japanese and Manga Society at Aston university. Most of the members of Korean society are Psychology undergraduates so I found that quite interesting and wanted to see if there was an actual link between these types of university students and an interest in East Asian culture as many of them join related societies such as the ones mentioned previously or martial arts societies from these specific cultures to develop their interests or to find new hobbies and interests out of curiosity. My main research question is \u2018What Psychology students\u2019 experiences are in being interested in Korean culture?\u2019 I decided this would be an Interpretative phenomenological study as it focuses on student\u2019s personal experiences and reasonings behind why they chose to study Psychology and why and how they became interested in Korean culture. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) focuses on \"wanting to understand the meaning of human experience\" this suggests that the method is focused on trying to understand and make sense of how people make sense of their experiences. IPA is also an idiographic form of research method as it is \"conducted at the level of the individual case\" so you\u2019re able to \"make specific claims about the individuals studied\" (Sullivan, C. &amp; Forrester, M.,2019). This means that it is more person orientated and allows researchers to look at certain niche groups and create specialised generalisations on specific typesgroups of people. Therefore, I felt like it was a method that was most suited to this topic as the group of people I am studying are quite specific. I approached the analysis by highlighting points of interest whilst transcribing the audio of my semi-structured interview. After completing the transcription, I went through my highlighted areas and did descriptive summaries on them. I then tried to group the coding to come up with relevant theories and see if anything was contradictory or could be explained further. Analysis The key themes I will be discussing in this analysis are relatability and self-discovery, as they constantly came up throughout the interview which allowed me to group multiple parts of discussion into these two themes. Relatability I chose relatability as one of the themes because during the interview, my participant Faith (Fake name) mentioned a lot of situations where she felt she could relate to them through her personal experiences. Faith mentioned that true crime, especially rape cases was one of the reasons she became interested in Psychology as it touched her. Being South African, Faith felt like she could relate to the issue of citizens going through the constant threat of gender-based violence against women. A study conducted found that gender inequality was part of the reason why women were more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner or contract HIVAIDS from them. The researchers found and concluded that women with violent and controlling male partners (abusive) were more likely to contract the viruses as those men would force their partners to take part in risky sexual practices (Dunkle et al, 2004). Faith mentioned that prostitution was also illegal in South Africa and again, due to the gender disparities, female sex workers are criminalised, and systems aren\u2019t set in place to protect them from harm. Faith wants to \"help in positive change, treating people like people instead of (.) dehumanising like. [they\u2019ve been though a lot]\". This further supports the claim that sex workers are not treated fairly and due to their nature of work and even based on just their gender, are not protected but even blamed. Faith feels that Korean culture is respectful, and group orientated, she states that \"with the whole South Korean culture like they are all like respectful to each other it\u2019s a culturist culturistic culture so like I really enjoy that\". From this we can infer that Faith is drawn to the group orientated mindset, however, I am assuming that when she means \u2018culturistic\u2019 she meant collectivist, I did check it by her to be sure. She feels like South Korean social culture is like South African culture in terms of mutual respect for the people around you and the collectivism shown amongst people, she mentions that \"I love working together\" and \"in South Africa you know your neighbours, you know everyone, here you don\u2019t [know your neighbours] you don\u2019t know your flatmates\" this suggests that she can relate to Korean culture more than Western culture as they share similar cross-cultural values that she understands, thus supporting the effect of relatability on her interest in South Korean culture. Self-discovery I chose self-discovery as another theme because whilst talking to Faith, I was able to find out that she felt personal connections to some experiences she discussed and felt that they brought out or revitalised parts of her interests or personalities that were previously doormat or overshadowed. Faith stated that Psychology was her favourite subject during sixth form, and it was the only one she found interesting during A levels \"A levels was like the worst two years of my life\" this suggests that A levels was not an enjoyable time for Faith and further shows how Psychology could have been her favourite subject. She also highlights how her Psychology teacher during that time was really kind and helpful to her \"he helped me like prepare everything to do for uni\" she says now, she does not regret her decision to study Psychology at University all these things combined may have influenced the positive feelings she started to have when first learning Psychology which has led her to pursue it at a higher level. Faith finds that she is learning more about herself through Psychology even though she believes that \"Psychology involves learning about others\" this suggests that Psychology allows for the personal development of students who study it and gives a chance for them to open their minds and find out about other things that may interest them. Within the theme of self-discovery, as Faith became more interested in Korean culture, she also became interested in Korean skin care \"South Korea has the best skin care\" this just coincides with the common sentiment of Korean skincare. The country is known worldwide as the plastic surgery capital and for its dermatological research and highly popularised cosmetic culture which includes skin-care routines, this has led to the sale of high quality, mostly affordable products targeted for the skin on the global market (find research stats &amp; qoute). Due to the increased interest in Korean culture, this has also increased accessibility to these things and many media outlets such as Korean music and media, this as a whole, is known as the \u2018Hallyu wave\u2019. Faith also expresses her interests in music and media, specifically K-pop, she expressed that she really enjoyed dancing to K-pop groups songs as she was not able to during secondary school, Korean culture \"has brought back like dancing part of me back\" this suggests that exploring the culture further has allowed her to pursue her interests again. Faith has also taken an interest in Korean food and feels like the country\u2019s cooking practices have entered her cooking style \"like now I\u2019m starting to cook with like Soy sauce [and all these things]\" this shows how influenced Faith has become by Korean culture and how its seamlessly interwoven into her life. She states that \"everything I do now just leads me to them\", the \u2018them\u2019 being the main interest points of Korean culture for her e.g., dance and cooking. Faith also found interest in Korean dramas and movies due to recommendations from friends but was already interested in other foreign shows \"(.) I just got bored of watching Western stuff\" this suggests Faith\u2019s willingness to consume media and entertainment different to watch she usually consumes, indicating an open, which was one of the reasons I expressed for the connection of Psychology students and their interest in Korean culture as Psychology students usually cultivate an open mind during their degrees. Through this analysis of the themes, I have been able to conclude that there is a link between Psychology students\u2019 experiences with interests in Korean culture whilst focusing on Faith and what her experiences are. The link is related to the benefits of open mindedness which allows you to find new interests pr develop old ones that you previously had, especially open mindedness to cultures different or similar to your own but in another societal setting.", "positive": "I just wanted to find out for my placement applications Oh okay, thanks dad What time is auntie \u2019s funeral please?

{"id": "aug_420", "anchor": "Abstract Partial replication of Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) cued visual attention task, where participants were cued, and then attended to a stimulus shown on either the right or left hemifield. 75% of the trials were congruent, in which participants were cued to the same side as the stimulus was presented, and 25% were incongruent. Alpha activity at the left parietal lobe (P3) was higher 200ms before stimulus onset when the stimulus was cued to the left compared to the right. This supports Klimesch\u2019s (2007) alpha inhibition hypothesis, stating that high alpha activity indicates inhibition in task-irrelevant brain regions. This finding paves way to further research on the implications of alpha activity and its relation to anticipatory attention. Introduction Alpha oscillations (8-13Hz) have an inhibitory function and are involved in attentional selection and suppression (Klimesch, 2012). The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007) highlights that high alpha activity indicates inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. Alpha activity is modulated by attention, as when stimuli are presented on a screen, contralateral brain areas are activated and ipsilateral are inhibited (task irrelevant). Mazahari et al.\u2019s (2014) cued flanker task involved typically developing (TD), combined subtype, and inattentive ADHD participants. Null or response preparation (RP) cues preceded each trial, with an 84% accuracy of the correct direction to attend. The AIH was demonstrated as TD adolescents showed the greatest alpha suppression following the RP cues, with inattentive ADHD subtypes showing the least, due to their difficulty responding to environmental cues. Greatest alpha suppression was detected directly after cue onset for the TD group, with no group difference in alpha suppression following a null cue, suggesting that RP cues influence the lateralisation of processing. Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) cued visual attention task involved a central arrow indicating which hemifield, a 50% chance of being cued left or right, the participants should attend to. The target stimulus was then presented, and participants were asked whether the bar was small or large (50% chance of each). Congruent trials included an instructional cue which was consistent with the location of the bar (75% of trials), and 25% of trials incongruent. Congruent trials showed stronger alpha suppression on sides contralateral to the hemifield where the stimuli were processed, derived from EEG recordings of the parietal, frontal, and fronto-medial regions, further supporting the AIH. Incongruent trials had an opposite effect due to incorrect anticipation of the stimulus. Fronto-medial and parietal regions demonstrated phase coupling between the RP cue and stimulus onset, and post-stimulus (200-600ms). Previous research shows alpha activity increases on the contralateral side to the stimuli attended, being most prominent in parietal and occipital regions before stimulus onset. The current study partially replicates Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) cued visual attention task, hypothesising an increased alpha activity in the left parietal lobe (P3) when stimuli are presented on the left hemifield compared to the right, before target stimuli are presented for congruent trials. Method Participants 39 psychology undergraduate students were selected via opportunity sampling, but one participant\u2019s data was excluded as data was only available for one condition of the experiment. Design A repeated measures design consisted of the independent variable (cue location) with two levels: left or right hemifield, and the dependent variable (the alpha amplitudes of the P3 electrode in \ud835\udf07V (microvolts)). Materials The active EEG electrode was used to record alpha activity, the reference electrode provided a comparison and the earth electrode reduced interference, all connected to Biopac MP36 for data collection. Everi cream removed dead skin from the scalp, and AC cream adhered the electrode to the scalp, improving conductivity. Psychopy presented stimuli and sent event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. The stimuli were two arrow cues (&lt; and &gt;), and two bars (Figure 1). Procedure Alpha band oscillations (8\u201313Hz) were identified in the raw EEG data recorded (0.5-35Hz) with a sampling rate of 1000Hz. The 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Technologies, 2012) was employed, wherein the active electrode was attached to P3, reference to Fz, and earth to the forehead near the hairline. An impedance reading &lt;10k\u03a9 was required prior to data collection, after which eligible participants were provided the right to withdraw and informed consent retrieved. Participants engaged in a practice trial, which began with instructions stating a cue would appear on the screen informing them which side to anticipate a stimulus, followed by a brief pause and either a small or large bar appearing on the appropriate side of the screen. Participants were then instructed to press \u2018L\u2019 if a large or \u2018S\u2019 if a small bar appeared on the screen. The cue (&lt; or &gt;) was displayed for 35ms, followed by a fixation cross to recapture participants\u2019 attention to the centre of the screen, and then a small or large bar appearing on the specific hemifield for 50ms. Feedback was provided after each trial, with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 800ms and 12 trials in total in the practice run. The practice run involved 4 trial types (arrow right to either small or large bar, and arrow left to either small or large bar) each repeating 3 times. The practice run involved only congruent trials; arrows pointed to the hemifield where the stimulus was presented. After completing the practice trials, participants were introduced to the experimental trials and recording of EEG alpha activity commenced. Experimental trials differed as no feedback was provided after trials, the ISI was between 200-1200ms, 25% of the trials were incongruent (stimulus was presented in the opposite side that the cue pointed to) and 75% congruent. Event markers were sent at stimulus onset, and each trial type was repeated 20 times in a randomised order (80 trials in total), wherein 50% of trials cued left and 50% right. Upon completion, the electrodes were removed, gel cleaned from the scalp and participants were debriefed. Results Data Treatment Event markers were used to identify stimulus onset. Alpha activity was investigated after display of arrow cues and 200ms before stimulus onset. The data was rectified to convert negative values into positive, showing the average signal strength (\ud835\udf07V) compared to the range, regardless of activity being inhibitory or excitatory. Data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the effects of outliers. Rectification and integration ensured that accurate means were taken for each condition. These rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for further analysis. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied as the normality of data assumption for Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test was violated (p &lt; .05). Table 1. Median and interquartile ranges for alpha amplitudes in left parietal lobe in cued left and cued right conditions (n=38). Table 1. shows median RAAA in P3 was greater in the cue left compared to cue right condition 200ms before stimulus onset, and a Wilcoxon signed rank test shows this difference was significant (W=566, n=38, p =.005). Discussion 200ms prior to stimulus onset, RAAA increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left compared to the right hemifield, supporting the research hypothesis. Stimuli presented on the left hemifield led to an increase in alpha activity on the left hemisphere due to inhibition as this region is task-irrelevant, and stimuli processed on the contralateral hemisphere led to increased alpha activity at P3. The findings support both the AIH and Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) findings, showing an increase in alpha activity in task-irrelevant regions prior to stimulus presentation. This is because RP cueing affects the lateralisation of processing, leading to the anticipation of stimuli appearing on the same hemifield the cue directed them to. A methodological flaw is that high impedance affects data quality as it leads to variance in the measurements and requires more trials to ensure statistical significance in analyses of P3 (Kappenman and Luck, 2010). This can be mitigated by high pass filtering and artifact rejection, along with using a cool dry recording environment. The findings of this study lend weight to Klimesch\u2019s (2007) AIH, and the influence of attention on alpha brain activity. Future research should explore specific types of attention e.g., anticipatory and temporal, and their influence on alpha activity.", "positive": "Thanks for getting back to me.

They offer a variety of transportation including; car-sharing and exotic car hiring. Enterprise Holdings is its parent company with over 100,000 branches worldwide, employing more than 100,000 people (Enterprise.co.uk, 2020). Enterprise Holdings acquired City Car Club expanding to \u2018Enterprise Car Club\u2019 who hold a variety of fuel-efficient cars and vans rentable by the hour or day, through mobile devices for bookings, unlocking and returning using iOS and Android applications with tailored plans (Enterprise Holdings, 2020). Membership entails fuel servicing, breakdown cover, insurance, cleaning, and MOTs. A vehicle is only paid for when required not otherwise. This report will demonstrate a yearly period plan including different actions split over months to boost brand awareness amongst the student demographic at Aston University. Segmentation, target market, differentiation and positioning Segmentation is the process of dividing markets of potential customers into specific groups based on common characteristics, reducing the risk of an unsuccessful marketing campaign. The segmentation will investigate students on and off campus interested in vehicle usage whilst at university (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020). A target market is the group of individuals a business aims to sell its products and services to, where marketing messages can be crafted effectively once the market is established (Omicsonline.org, 2020). The target market is aimed towards the student demographic at Aston University on and off campus coming from different towns and backgrounds. It is innovative to allow students to drive flexibly instead of incurring the cost of a vehicle overall for commuting. The segment could become profitable through promotional activities and distribution channels after identifying the segment\u2019s needs. (Marketing-Insider, 2020). Differentiation of Enterprise Car club is offering a self-service car rental plan, tailored to students at cost-effective prices with virtual membership and option to rent by the hour or day, alongside a monthly membership option currently priced at \u00a35.95 per hour and monthly prices at \u00a36 per month subscription. This is more accessible to a younger demographic of students who typically use mobile technology frequently. Aston University students could see this as an opportunity to benefit by not spending significant amounts, especially with current rising costs of living. Positioning refers to a business\u2019s ability to influence perceptions of consumers concerning a brand or product. The main objective is to establish an identity of an offering, so customers perceive it positively (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020). Enterprise is a company that is going to be offering a cheap and available service to students alongside reducing carbon footprints(reference). This could attract segments of the demographic, who favour being conscious of the environment for the future. (reference) Enterprise Rent A Cars\u2019 already significant profile to allow consumers to feel safe with the company\u2019s new service, proving the reliable position they already pose compared to competitors such as CO-wheels CarClub and SIXT. Students can be targeted through social media platforms and through campaigning on university campus similarly to UberEATS, by employing campaigners to increase awareness. A perceptual map is a tool used to differentiate competitors and highlight any gaps in the market. It shows our business as a high quality and low-price service, highlighting the potential for the brand to succeed and gain awareness amongst students. One of our main competitors is SIXT, discovered by constructing this perceptual map, we have established our advantage as we offer suitable age restrictions on the use of rentals as students will want to travel inside and outside of Birmingham more frequently. Campaign objectives Specific is a clear, precise and directional objective put forward to understand what results are expected within the workforce, instead of the objective being generalised, causing confusion and poorer results (Lalama, 2015). An effective goal would be to increase sales by a certain percentage or increase the target on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis. Our specific objectives are 1)To attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. 2)To improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service Measurable measures a goal and is the stage where numbers come into fruition to keep track of progress. However, it can be difficult to understand if an objective has been reached. Our measuring will be through: 1)Using surveys to measure student\u2019s demand based on needs and wants, 2)Identifying any potential niches. This would allow the measurable objective of attaining 40-50 subscription members each month and link to the founding values of the company to honour consumers by listening to them. Achievable goals are setting goals in a realistic period by taking small, planned steps towards a goal. 1)An example of a goal to be set is attaining data within each quarter of the year alongside aiming to increase brand awareness by 10%. Additionally, once achieved, the goal can progress to 20 new subscription members to achieve progression. Overall this will contribute to the objective of reaching out to Aston University staff and students, with reasonable pricing that is visibly differentiated to competitors. Realistic is forming goals based on the context of current economic, organisational and market conditions (Anon, 2020). 1)The current economic state will determine the likelihood of success when aiming to increase sales, as this would not be the best goal to set if the country is close to experiencing a recession period in their economic cycle. 2)Being the best low-cost provider is an example of a realistic goal for Enterprise CarClub profile competition, considering economic uncertainty in the UK because of Brexit. People may be less inclined to invest in vehicle ownership or maintenance because of the potential future inflation rate and currency value volatility. 3)Targeting 500 students as dealing with a small target market in the geographic location of Birmingham, this is a link to what we want to achieve and realistic. Targeted &amp; Timed is using a specified deadline to reach a goal. If a time expiration does not exist, it will hinder efforts towards an achievement and evaluation. 1)Trying to achieve the specified number by the end of the year at Aston University, the target will be achieved through pushing collaborations through social media, helping target and appeal to the target market. 2)Customers will be more engaged with the services being offered, whilst measuring the effectiveness of this approach during and after and if results are proving unsatisfactory, measures can be taken to improve consumer satisfaction (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). Strategy and general rationale for specific tools In the marketing strategy, there has been research on five stages, concerning our strategy. In initial thought, developing a strategic mission, vision and values allow Enterprise CarClub to set its standard to consumers and provide a positive image for their services. Setting objectives as stated in campaign objectives would be important to reach the vision, but meeting targets will only be possible if a strategy is tailored to the intended path. Executing the strategy would be the next step aided by prerequisites put in place, for example; a Gantt chart to work with, values to work towards goals and a mission to work on present communications to gain significant awareness. After executing the strategy, the focus is on analysing the external environment continuously, alongside the company\u2019s internal situation to identify corrective adjustments (Gamble, Thompson and Peteraf, 2019). General rationale for specific tools selected: In the marketing plan, looking further into advertising as a negotiated form of traditional and digital communication from an identifiable source can influence audiences. In the marketing plan, we are looking to follow a push strategy through Enterprise\u2019s profile to attract the target market to buy subscriptions. It will allow Enterprise CarClub to reach the goal of building awareness with students, encourage and incentivise them to build a differentiated strategy in competition with others. A community of consumers can be built alongside the strategy by considering and monitoring brand image. (Richards and Curran, 2002). Secondly, Sales Promotion is going to be used as it influences consumers in a way to buy a product (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is a tool that will influence student behaviour positively as incentives will be offered to trial the service initially and then decide to proceed if satisfied. A pull strategy will reel in consumers through discounts, bonuses, and coupons creating a feeling of need for the service. Marketing Tool Plans- Advertising Tool Advertising is a strong form of communication that will enable Enterprise CarClub to reach their audience through engaging using a variety of resources, using the media category to carry advertising messages to allow for the use of billboards, magazines, digital newspapers and mobile and online advertising (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). Digital media has a strong level of interactivity in modern lives with social media being very prominent, for example, Instagram. Using this tool will provide Enterprise with a giant opportunity for advertisement (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is prefered to use this tool because of the benefits it will bring in terms of reaching a wider audience, especially with electronic word of mouth having a large impact and high level of users. Advertising holds the credibility to support marketing efforts such as; sales promotion, using methods to secure customers into the car rental subscriptions as consumers spend on what they believe will bring them reputable value. Advertising holds the capability of effecting knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviour of a target audience, persuading individuals to buy a product they have never purchased. It can suggest that advertising can increase sales using manipulative and psychological techniques with a large segment of passive consumers concerning the \u2018Strong\u2019 theory of advertising (Fill, 2009). The (AIDA) model presents creating brand awareness of a product or service, the interest of the benefits of its uses to build sufficient foundation to encourage the buyer to research further, desire to go forward with an emotional connection through brand personality making consumers want it and action to make the buyer take the next step of engaging in making a phone call, signing up to a newsletter or engaging in a live chat for further information. With awareness, a PR campaign can be running towards the student target market each month with different resources. Interest wise we could use surveys to gain student interest on campus to then offer further consultation after gaining the initial interest of what is important to their tailored service. Desire could lead to running local buzz campaigns to generate discounts due to the curiosity of a new service. An action could be to use local advertising alongside social media to receive discounts during face to face or phone advertising to show empathy to needs for the short term or long term (How much do celebrities and influencers get paid for social posts? - Our Social Times - Social Media for Business, 2020). Sales Promotion Tool Sales promotion offers an incentive to encourage target audiences with promotional messages to buy the product sooner than later (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It creates a differentiated strategy, launching the new Enterprise CarClub at Aston University by offering value to customers through planning sales promotion to incentivise students. Upselling opportunities are created with a variety of packages, starting from \u00a34.50, enhanced at \u00a33.45hour and under 22s at \u00a35.95hour plans. Sales Promotion presents the entrance to a partnership endorsement by sponsoring our car rental service. A well-known Birmingham hip hop artist \u2018Mist\u2019 will be integrated, who possesses a following of 670,000 (Instagram.com, 2020). By working in collaboration, this will build brand credibility and make the brand stand out to the demographic at Aston. Consumers will recall and remember the promotion, bringing in targeted behavioural marketing. Therefore, the student\u2019s interest is captured, making them feel more inclined to sign up for the subscription (The Pros and Cons of Celebrity Endorsements - Baer Performance Marketing, 2020).. This partnership will offer a promotional online code discount and print coupons associated with himself to pull in more consumers to use the service, working towards the goal of reaching 500 buyers by year-end. He is already proactive in supporting Birmingham to make the city a better place through his involvement in projects, he will be more inclined to partner at a lower price than expected by an influencer of his popularity. (Mist Interview: U.K. Star Talks Hometown of Birmingham &amp; U.S. Rap Influences| Billboard, 2020). Endorser attributes tie in with the TEARS model of trustworthiness, relating to endorsement being someone who can be trusted, have respect and expertise in the brand, physical attractiveness with pride in his health. Coming from a disadvantaged background in Birmingham, then progressing resonates with the target audience as students use him as inspiration towards goals. To have someone who is not just someone with a conative but affective strategy too, makes consumers feel to act on the Enterprise CarClub through a use of display of emotion and care (The Five Components in the TEARS Model of Endorser Attributes T Trustworthiness | Course Hero, 2020). Managerial accountability allows the results of sales promotion to be easily justified in comparison to advertising. This way the margin for error as a calculated number will help in realising if the chosen promotion is effective towards our target market (Fill and Turnbull, 2016; Difference between advertising and sales promotion, 2020). Implementation plan demonstrating the relative scheduling of Marcom tool activity: Creating the Gantt chart has enabled the 12 months of promotion for Enterprise Car Club to be planned out month by month. It establishes clear objectives and timeframes for which each tool should be executed. Using the advertising tool helps build brand value and image by encouraging change in consumer behaviour. For the advertising tool, TV advertisements, billboards, and promotional products will use the pulsing marketing strategy. These are scheduled as a continuous schedule lasting the whole year at a low level throughout, becoming heavier during the peak times for selling (Continuous Advertising Definition | Marketing Dictionary | MBA Skool-Study.Learn. Share., 2020). The peak times here are September, to take advantage of the advertising opportunities during freshers when students are most interested. Also, from December to February, the advertising tool is being used alongside our sponsor Mist performing, allocated sufficiently before the event and after to keep the awareness going. Viral marketing is a flighting strategy due to the one-month period it is allocated solely to throughout the year. Within the advertising tool, internetsocial media adverts will be the continuous marketing strategy, as they will be available and shown to customers throughout the whole year, unlike the other tasks within the tool (Flighting, 2020). The sales promotion tool will make use of discountscoupons and loyalty schemes as a continuous marketing strategy. These methods will always be available to consumers, so they are reminded of the need for the services, regardless of sales performance at any given time of the year. The fresher\u2019s fair, contests, exhibitions, and fairs will all be making use of the flighting strategy as the advertising will be run at certain planned times, then have a cessation period throughout the year (9 Benefits of Sales Promotions - Gary A. Sanchez, 2020). Integration of marcoms Our specific objective is to improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service and to attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. Advertising and sales promotion have been decided as the two main tools because of brand awareness it will provide the up and coming brand. Advertising is informing and reminding about the products and services and a form of mass communication and links to sales promotion goals to increase sales quickly using discounts for example. Considering the timeframe and the main aim to build awareness in the Aston student\u2019s target market, these tools provide a gateway to pull in consumers through trailing the service and use of endorsements to capture loyal customers.", "positive": "I hope you are very well I won a free clear pencil case lol Not too bad thank you, need to see you soon!!

{"id": "aug_430", "anchor": "The period of adolescence is a time where behaviour is characterised by impulsivity, increased risk taking and an affinity for peer groups (Spear, 2010). During no other period in the lifespan is the prevalence of death so high relative to health, with Steinberg (2013) reporting a dramatic spike in self-inflicted behaviours such as car accidents and crime. Adolescent behaviour and the reasons for its occurrence has posed a particular question for researchers. The duel systems process model proposes that adolescent typical behaviour is caused by a developmental imbalance between the subcortical socioemotional system implicated in sensitivity to rewards and novelty, relative to the cognitive control system responsible for impulse and emotional control as well as decision making (Shulman et al, 2016). The model hypothesises that the early activation and maturation of the ventral striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) in early adolescence increases one\u2019s propensity for sensation seeking whilst the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is still maturing, therefore attenuating impulse control (Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2011). It is predicted that sensation seeking behaviour increases at the early stages of adolescence and levels off as adulthood is reached, following an inverted \u2018U\u2019 shape trajectory. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob (2011) assessed this using longitudinal data from over 7000 participants aged 12-24, looking at self-reported changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking. They found that mean levels of impulsivity declined through adolescence and levelled off when participants reached their mid-20s, consistent with neurobiological research suggesting heightened activation of the ventral striatum in early to mid-adolescence relative to children and adults (Barkley-Leveson &amp; Galv\u00e1n, 2014). This supports the claim that adolescent typical behaviour is a product of nature due to the profound influence of brain structures and their relative levels of maturity on sensation seeking behaviour. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob\u2019s (2011) research is one of the first to report this trend using longitudinal data and to utilise such a large sample, representative of a diverse population. Furthermore, the use of such a large data set reduced the chance of type I errors. However, caution should be taken when drawing conclusions due to the risk of social desirability and response bias when using measures of self-report. It has been asserted by some researchers that adolescents possess the ability to evaluate risky decisions to the same level as adults (Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006), begging the questions as to why this age group engage in risk behaviours to such a degree? Observational data suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents heightened propensity for risk (Albert et al, 2013) with researchers suggesting adaptive benefits such as increasing peer status and peer affiliation with desirable social groups (Spear, 2010). Steinberg &amp; Gardener (2005) assessed the effects of peer contexts on risky decision making in 3 age groups including adolescents (13-16), youths (18-22) and adults (24+). All 306 participants completed 3 measures of risk orientation including 2 self-report measures and a computerised driving task named the Chicken Game. In this task participants were required to make decisions about whether to advance the vehicle once a traffic light turns from green to yellow (meaning an impending red light) with the possibility of a car crash if the car advances through a red light. Participants were randomly assigned either the peer condition where they would complete the task with 2 others or the alone condition. Steinberg &amp; Gardener found that each group engaged in comparable risk taking when alone but increased risk taking when in the presence of peers, more pronounced during middle and late adolescence. This suggest adolescents\u2019 susceptibility to peer influence relative to adults when taking risk, implying the role of nurture and social contexts in adolescent typical behaviours. This study has important implications for interventions seeking to reduce risky behaviour amongst adolescence (i.e. juvenile delinquency) suggesting attention should be directed towards increasing resistance to peer influence in young people. However, this study has arguably low ecological validity as it unable to capture the complex dynamic of risk taking with peers outside of a laboratory setting. In conclusion the cause of adolescent behaviour appears to be a combination of both nature and nurture influences, with research suggesting that peer influence may increase the brain\u2019s risk and reward system sensitivity (Albert et al, 2013). Subsequently, the duel process model and effects of peer stimuli may co-influence risky behaviours seen in adolescents as young people spend most of their time with peers (Spear, 2010). Therefore, the claim that adolescent behaviour reflects the influence of nature more so than nurture is not supported. Research suggest adolescence is the greatest risk period for the emergence of psychopathological disorders, with mental illness affecting 1 in 5 young people (Powers &amp; Casey, 2015). In light of this, this essay shall seek to critically discuss how brain development may facilitate the high prevalence of psychopathology during adolescence. Stress has been considered an important factor contributing to adolescents\u2019 vulnerability to internalising disorders, namely anxiety (Romeo, 2010). Brain areas identified as being implicated in this increased vulnerability includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which undergoes significant maturational changes and a reawakening during puberty (Spear, 2010). The HPA axis is responsible for controlling stress-induced hormonal secretion in response to stressors and does so by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation (McCormick et al.,2010). Once released, ACHT acts to increase the production and release of glucocorticoid hormones, which then act upon the brain to predetermine future responses to future stress stimuli. Using a battery of acute stressors, Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) assessed the hormonal stress response of prepubescent rats, compared to that of adult rats and found a greater, more prolonged ACHT and corticosterone response in the younger rats compared to adults. Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) suggested that it takes twice as long for these hormones to return to baseline level in premid-adolescent rats following stress stimuli relative to adult rats. Reflective of the results seen in animals, researchers have speculated that anxious individuals may show a delayed HPA axis recovery following a stressor, which in turn may make them slower to adjust to novelty, giving rise to psychopathological vulnerabilities (Spear, 2010). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results to human behaviour because of the use of animal data. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess levels of glucocorticoid in human adolescents because of the natural diurnal release rhythm it follows (Spear, 2010), meaning animal studies have provided a valuable opportunity to investigate this, whilst having strong experimental control. Furthermore, animal research is able to bypass the ethical implications to be considered when conducting human research (Eiland &amp; Romeo, 2013). Attention deficithyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be defined as inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity relative to an individual\u2019s age, that interferes with their functioning (Shaw et al., 2012). Onset of ADHD is around 7 years (occurring before puberty) and is prevalent in over 5% of children worldwide (Friedman &amp; Rapoport, 2015). Research has suggested that brain development through late childhood and adolescence is an important factor contributing to ADHD. Shaw et al (2007) assessed this using a longitudinal MRI scan study of 223 ADHD diagnosed participants matched with 223 typically developing (TD) controls. Shaw and colleagues found a marked delay in ADHD in achieving peak cortical thickness throughout the cerebrum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). This delay was most pronounced in the middle and lateral PFC, implicated in higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and planning, where peak thickness was achieved 5 years later than TD controls. In addition to this it was seen that the primary motor cortex conversely showed early maturation in ADHD (peaking age 7 years), when compared to controls (peaking age 7.4 years). Shaw and colleagues speculated that the delayed developmental trajectory of regions implicated in higher-order motor control, paired with the early maturation of the primary motor cortex may account for symptoms seen in ADHD i.e. poor motor control. This influential study was seen to be the first longitudinal neuroanatomic research evidencing the theory of delayed cortical maturation in ADHD, due to the advanced in MRI techniques seen in recent history. However, it should be noted that the results cannot endorse differences in intelligence and sexual dimorphisms seen in ADHD, despite their effect on cortical development because they strictly controlled for in the design. To conclude brain maturation and development in adolescents, relative to adults seems to have implications for various psychopathologies. Spear (2010) suggests for disorders like ADHD where onset occurs just prior to adolescence, motor control regions may show developmental anomalies, whereas disorders with adolescent aged onset i.e. anxiety, show developmental differences in the frontal regions. It can be speculated that the PFC\u2019s immaturity in adolescents relative to adults, may be sensitive to the reawakening and prolonged effects of the HPA axis. However, brain development is not the only factor giving rise to psychopathologies in adolescents with mental health varying by person. Instead some researchers propose the stress-diathesis model, suggesting an interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental stresses, predisposing certain individuals to psychopathologies during adolescence (Spear, 2010).", "positive": "r , Apologies for missing tutorial today, I have a cold, but please find attached the task for today.

{"id": "aug_433", "anchor": "\"Intro The Alpha Inhibition Hypothesis (AIH) is when high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas. the current experiment tested the alpha inhibition hypothesis using a cued visual attention task and predicted that; if recording from the left parietal lobe participants' alpha range activities would be higher in the cue left than cue right condition. Method A partial replication of an experiment was conducted, and it included recording alpha amplitudes from the left parietal lobe (P3), analysing the activity 200ms before stimulus onset in the cue left and cue right conditions. Results The results were significant and were consistent with the hypothesis. It can be concluded that the results supported the theory that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. Experiment write up, 1200 +- 10% (min1080, max1320) words, titles, title page tables, figures &amp; reference list not included in count Introduction The AIH, states that more alpha activity in one hemisphere leads to loss of attention and the disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (the other hemisphere), this indicates inhibition. Whereas less activity in one hemisphere leads to the opposite; an increase in attention and engagement (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha activity or waves are a type of brain wave. They are produced in circumstances of rest, especially when your eyes are closed and happen before you fall asleep (Alpha Waves and How They Help You Sleep, n.d.). The AIH is supported with research such as (Handel et al., 2011) who used a MEG (magneto-encephalogram) which has better spatial resolution and similar temporal resolution to an EEG for better results. They found that alpha activity is reduced in contralateral brain areas to the stimuli presented, that alpha activity is influenced by attention. A partial replication of Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) experiment: \"A shift of visual spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\", was conducted to compare alpha amplitudes at P3 between conditions and prove the hypothesis that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. As stimuli always processes contralaterally (opposite side of activity) We wanted to find out whether if, a side of the visual field was cued, would it lead to alpha inhibition on the contralateral side where participants anticipated the stimuli would appear? And which side would show bigger alpha amplitudes? Method Participants 38 undergraduate students took part in the research via volunteer sampling, there were originally 39, but one participant\u2019s data were removed as their data were only available for one of the two conditions. Design The design of the study was a repeated measure, the independent variable was whether the arrow cues pointed left or right, it also had two levels known as cue left and cue right. The dependent variable was the alpha amplitudes measured in \u00b5V (microvolts), recorded from P3. Materials A Biopac MP36 was used to collect data and EEG Electrodes were attached to participants\u2019 scalps using AC cream, Everi cream. PsychoPy software was used to present stimuli for a specific period of time and send event markers set to end immediately to Biopac, through a Stimtracker device. The Stimuli used were two white bars on a black background, one large, one small (see figure 1). Two arrows, one pointing left and one pointing right (see figure 2). And white fixation cross (see figure 3). Procedure Firstly, the Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz, digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and Stimtracker, event markers let us know when stimuli were shown. Calculation channels were set up to record activity in the alpha frequency range from 8-13Hz before checking the impedance, with the sampling rate being 1000 Hz, alpha amplitudes were also measured. Participants had EEG electrodes with AC cream on them placed on their scalps using the 1020 positioning system (Trans-Cranial Techologies.,2012), with P3 being recorded. The active electrode was placed at P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz, an earth electrode was attached to the forehead near the hairline and everything was measured relative to Cz.The areas were scrubbed with Everi cream beforehand for better adhesion. They were then asked to complete a cued visual attention task using PsychoPy. Cued with a fixation cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms an arrow indicating whether it would be the left or right side of the visual field the target, would appear, in the centre of the screen for 34ms whilst participants were asked by the experimenter to focus their attention to that side of the visual field. There was 50% chance of being cued left or right. There were different event markers for cue left and right conditions and they were sent at stimulus onset. There were 20 blocks of 4 trial types, each block had cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) randomised within blocks with half of trials cued left and half cued right. Results The raw 9-13Hz Alpha EEG data for each condition was analysed using the event markers sent from PsychoPy to identify when the stimuli would be presented. We looked at the period of 200ms of recorded activity before stimulus presentation, after arrow cues had been shown and used Biopac by rectifying and averaging over 50 samples of raw alpha data to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. This smooths out the data (averaging over samples), reduces the impact of outlyingextreme values and converts negative values to positive, so we get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. Statistical Analysis Table 1 shows that the rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were higher in the cue left condition than the cue right condition. According to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the difference was significant, and the inferential statistics are as follows (t=566, n=38, p&lt;0.005). Discussion The results were significant, so we used a non-parametric test to find the inferential statistics from the data collected. The results fit with the hypothesis as the results are consistent with AIH as recorded activity from P3cue left were higher than cue right, which were the task irrelevant brain areas, suggesting that alpha suppression happened there. Methodological issues that could have affected the results could have been varying levels of impedance, associated with more variance in the measurements but would affect both conditions equally. Another methodological issue that could have affected results could have been artefacts, such as blinking, that would affect the waves. From the experiment overall, I conclude that the AIH is highly supported by research as it has high temporal reliability, and despite all the methodological issues, the results are still valid.\"", "positive": ", It states that the credits I received for the study have been revoked, could I please ask why?

{"id": "aug_435", "anchor": "r , Hope you are well. I just wanted to ask you something. Following the last email, that I had sent to you about my hospital visit whilst on placement in , my health still hasn't improved so I am considering booking a flight home for to see my doctor as this is when we have a semester break. However, I have a block course in for 4 days which is worth 3 credits and was just wondering if I would be penalised if I didn't partake in it? This would mean that I only have 28 credits for this semester and then would go on to take 31 credits next semester. So would end up with a total of 59 credits instead of 60. Please can you let me know if this is acceptable or not? Thank you! Kind Regards, To whom this may concern, I hope you are well. I wanted to enquire about cancelling an accommodation booking for due to financial reasons as a results of COVID-19 Pandemic. Can I please have some more information about this and alternatively can I be given some information about adjusting moving in dates and what that means for the overall cost of accommodation? Kind Regards, Dear , Hope you are well. I've just checked and I'm registered for a module that I had changed to another. I was formerly doing but have since changed it to . However, still appears on . Please could I have some assistance in officially confirming what modules I am set to partake in. Kind Regards, Hi , Hope you are well!!

Please feel free to message me any questions whenever and contact me if you have any worries or problems and I will do my best to help you! Kind Regards, Hi !! So nice to hear from you so quickly!! Yes I know it's just such a strange time but you can get through it :) Yes of course, that's what I'm here for! I hope I can support you as best as I can in whatever way is helpful for you. So I did a study placement at . I chose to do a study placement as I wanted to improve my language skills and they had a well renowned language programme at the University. The experience was literally one of the best things I've done in my life. I met so many people of different nationalities and made some amazing friends as well as really improving my language skills (written, spoken and in particular Grammar). If you want anymore information let me know. It was really hard to adjust at first and I was really homesick. However, I just tried to integrate myself into all of the student events and talk to as many people as possible. As soon as I made friends then I felt a bit more settled and it took me a while to feel comfortable in using day to day. However, you'd be suprised at how nice people are and they just appreciate trying to speak in so just really go for it. I wish I had been a bit more confident to start with. It's important to say as well that I was going to do a half study, half work placement at first but decided to stick with study as that was what was best for me. But I would highly recommend doing half and half as you get the best of both worlds and also it looks good employability wise. If you feel that you really struggle with grammar etc then I would definitely suggest half a study placement as it will aid you in final year when it comes to dissertation and assessments etc. Yes please message me whenever and I will keep checking in on you as I really understand how difficult this year can be especially in the current climate.

{"id": "aug_436", "anchor": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs \u00a3157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a caf\u00e9. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a caf\u00e9 to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Caf\u00e9 Kluuvikatu 3, caf\u00e9 which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too. Furthermore, i found a live music bar for my CEO to visit, called Storyville, Helsinki. this offers food, alongside live music band, piano room and dance floor which seems very entertaining.", "positive": "r , Thank you for your email.

Hence, I created my own formula called IPROG technique. I = introduction of the role I was in, P = problem I faced, R = resolving steps I took, O = outcome and G = going forward the things I have learned from the experience and how I will apply these to the job I am applying for. After adapting my IPROG technique I was becoming successful with my applications and this was how I passed my first ever interview with . Secondly, I feel my success from my interview stems in how I was able to speak confidently and also display my personality through being pleasant and building an initial rapport with the interviewing panel at the start of my interview and at the end when I had the opportunity to ask them questions. I therefore think it\u2019s a really good thing to display your personality because often employers don\u2019t just want to employ a person who looks good on paper with high grades but also someone who is friendly, easy to talk to as this reflects the ability to work well with others and build a friendly working atmosphere. Thirdly, for me the whole process of constantly applying for jobs within has been very rewarding. Overtime, I have began to understand what exactly employers are looking for and have been able to directly link my experience back to the job I am applying for both in my interview and applications. The process has allowed for new career-related doors to open for me especially at the right time too because looking back I wouldn\u2019t have been able to work for during university. Finally, I 100% believe that the events, programmes and opportunities I have been involved with at during my academic career has proven to be very fruitful as this was how I was able to pass my interview despite not having an actual job to prove my team work, leadership, delivering at pace and many more skills and experiences. I am therefore very grateful to to have developed such opportunities for students like myself to get involved with and become employable.

{"id": "aug_437", "anchor": "Dear Madam, Here are the details of the itinerary items I have created for your conference trip to Helsinki between the 2nd and 4th of September 2021. I have found a 4-star hotel situated 0.4 miles away from the city centre. For two nights it will cost \u00a3216. It is also situated close to the Seurasaraselka waters so, if we book a room with a view you will always get to see the water. This is \u00a316 over budget but it was the best option in regards to tourist reviews and location. Caferino Obas is a cafe, which is only a ten-minute walk away from the hotel and they offer a great breakfast menu. They offer a wide range of options and alternatives for those who are allergic to Seafood. Helsinki Museum is a twenty-minute walk from the hotel but it is specifically a museum popular with tourists for being able to \"uphold Helsinki's heritage\". Therefore you will learn a lot about the city you are visiting. Finland's national dish is Saute\u00e9d Reindeer. So I have found a very popular restaurant called Restaurant Lasipalatsi which offers this dish. They have a wide range of sides to go with this dish and before booking the restaurant we are able to call them up beforehand and warn them about your seafood allergy. Therefore the food will be catered for you specifically. There is a souvenir shop called Mikebon which offer a wide range of gifts. Especially toys which may be great for your children. Finally, for the evening I have found a Rock Music Club called Tavastia. Since you love live music I have found a club that offers Helsinki's popular genre and the club itself is quite old so this holds some heritage too. I hope you like the suggestions.

This is in regards to missing the Exam for the module (Module: ) on the &lt;DDmonthYYYY&gt; (Time:09:30) The reason for absence was because I was physically unwell and doctors assumed I had something called and they suggested I did not go to work or to university.I was constantly vomiting every hour and could not put any other students at risk either. I apologise for the delay; as I am writing this I am still very weak and recovering from a week of being sick and constantly going in and out of the hospital walk-in centres and the GP. When I first became sick, earlier in the week I wasn\u2019t sure whether I was going to attend the exam so I made my seminar leader for the module aware of the situation.And told him how I was unsure what to do and whether I was going to attend the exam. He provided me a link to the and the exceptional circumstances form. Which I have looked at and will be trying to fill-in throughout the day since it is very hard for me to be on the laptop when I\u2019m very nauseous. I believe I have the supporting evidence from the Doctors so that will not be an issue. In regards of the exam if I hadn\u2019t been sick I would\u2019ve been able to attend because I was prepared however now during this period i am fully drained.

If I am not well by and I believe I won\u2019t be able to sit the exam I will fill in the necessary forms for missing an exam which I think I need to do.Im not so sure how it works.If you have any advice please let me know. Thank you ( ) Dear whom it may concern, I apologise for sending this email this now. I was not fully aware of the whole process which caused the delay. This is in regards to missing the Exam for the module (Module: ) on the &lt;DDmonthYYYY&gt; (Time:09:30) The reason for absence was because I was physically unwell and doctors assumed I had something called and they suggested I did not go to work or to university.I was constantly vomiting every hour and could not put any other students at risk either. I apologise for the delay; as I am writing this I am still very weak and recovering from a week of being sick and constantly going in and out of the hospital walk-in centres and the GP. When I first became sick, earlier in the week I wasn\u2019t sure whether I was going to attend the exam so I made my seminar leader for the module aware of the situation.And told him how I was unsure what to do and whether I was going to attend the exam. He provided me a link to the and the exceptional circumstances form. Which I have looked at and will be trying to fill-in throughout the day since it is very hard for me to be on the laptop when I\u2019m very nauseous. I believe I have the supporting evidence from the Doctors so that will not be an issue. In regards of the exam if I hadn\u2019t been sick I would\u2019ve been able to attend because I was prepared however now during this period i am fully drained. I do want to sit the exam when I\u2019m better so If you could please advise me further on what do that would be great. Thank you for understanding Yours sincerely, ( ) Year 1:", "label": 1}

{"id": "aug_446", "anchor": "Dear Madam, Here are the details of the itinerary items I have created for your conference trip to Helsinki between the 2nd and 4th of September 2021. I have found a 4-star hotel situated 0.4 miles away from the city centre. For two nights it will cost \u00a3216. It is also situated close to the Seurasaraselka waters so, if we book a room with a view you will always get to see the water. This is \u00a316 over budget but it was the best option in regards to tourist reviews and location. Caferino Obas is a cafe, which is only a ten-minute walk away from the hotel and they offer a great breakfast menu. They offer a wide range of options and alternatives for those who are allergic to Seafood. Helsinki Museum is a twenty-minute walk from the hotel but it is specifically a museum popular with tourists for being able to \"uphold Helsinki's heritage\". Therefore you will learn a lot about the city you are visiting. Finland's national dish is Saute\u00e9d Reindeer. So I have found a very popular restaurant called Restaurant Lasipalatsi which offers this dish. They have a wide range of sides to go with this dish and before booking the restaurant we are able to call them up beforehand and warn them about your seafood allergy. Therefore the food will be catered for you specifically. There is a souvenir shop called Mikebon which offer a wide range of gifts. Especially toys which may be great for your children. Finally, for the evening I have found a Rock Music Club called Tavastia. Since you love live music I have found a club that offers Helsinki's popular genre and the club itself is quite old so this holds some heritage too. I hope you like the suggestions. If you have any queries or changes, please let me know and I will be happy to look further. Best Wishes", "positive": "r Dr , I am currently a student going into my second year and I study .

How I understood this was for example, if you believe that X is the reason why Y is occurring, does the theory support this hypothesis? Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Secondly, in terms of the theory itself, are there specific development theories? I know this sounds strange to ask, but from what I know there is a dependency theory for instance. When it comes to theories are you talking about realism, liberalism, neoliberalism etc? Please clarify what theories would be seen as ideal in these cases. Moreover, the research topic I would like to explore is Remittances in .

Under this, police brutality, housing issues, development &amp; governance issues can be discussed. \u2022 social media - I\u2019ve seen back home and in the diaspora often clash due to held perceptions of each other.

Has the \u2018brain drain\u2019 caused the diaspora to be disconnected from back home? 2. How does the relationship between the diaspora and at home affect their views? 3.

I was looking at the assessment brief and there was some things I need you to clarify for me. The first being the 1. \"Development of theoretical expectations theoretical framework\". How I understood this was for example, if you believe that X is the reason why Y is occurring, does the theory support this hypothesis? Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Secondly, in terms of the theory itself, are there specific development theories? I know this sounds strange to ask, but from what I know there is a dependency theory for instance. When it comes to theories are you talking about realism, liberalism, neoliberalism etc? Please clarify what theories would be seen as ideal in these cases.

{"id": "aug_455", "anchor": "In the United Kingdom in 2019 there was 1.6% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Postnote, 2020). The high number of ASD children means that it is imperative to have correct measures in place when they are put through police interviewing. There are policies in place to support children under the age of 18 who classed as \u2018vulnerable witnesses\u2019 (impairment to intelligence and social functioning), by giving them assistance to provide the best evidence possible in court (Ministry of Justice, 2011). However, in our justice system there are still issues which need to be corrected, as current research shows that when a child is labelled with \u2018autism\u2019 the evidence they provide is questioned in credibility by jurors (Crane et al., 2018). On top of this, the difficulties present in ASD children could significantly impact the information that is gathered by police, as they lack communication, social skills (Knott et al., 2006) and also impairments in memory (Bruck et al., 2007). There are two recommendations which will be examined to help police gather evidence in ASD children. The standard cognitive interview includes four main techniques (K\u00f6hnken et al., 1999). Mental context reinstatement (MRC) is one segment of the interview that requires the person to go back in time to remember the emotions they felt and the physical environment around them (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2011). However, ASD children have impairments in their memory, specifically in their autonoetic consciousness (Gardiner, 2001), this therefore, means that they might find the process of MRC difficult. Evidence has shown this to be true as people with autism recalled fewer details in the MRC interview (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). This is especially relevant to ASD children, as they already tend to recall fewer details than typically developing (TD) children (Williams et al., 2006). Therefore, police need to find an appropriate way of aiding recall for ASD children as the MRC has shown to exacerbate their memory. The inclusion of sketching as a form of context reinstatement (Sketch-RC) rather than the normal MRC before a free recall has been seen to be beneficial for ASD children in recall (Mattison et al., 2014). A study that delved further into this had used ASD children and TD children to watch a video (Mattison et al., 2018), and then had compared sketch-RC and MRC, following with a free recall afterward. A probed recall phase was also used to gain further detail, but it was entirely based on what the children had stated in their free recall. In this case, the findings supported the usage of sketch-RC in interviewing as ASD children recalled 25% more than the ASD children in the MRC condition. This could be explained by the encoding specificity theory (Tulving, 1972); which states that the ASD children recalled better because the cues were present in encoding and retrieving, so, the sketches helped facilitate these cues more than just mentally reinstating the context. In contrast, Henry et al (2017) had conducted a similar study but additionally looked into \u2018verbal labels\u2019 and \u2018registered intermediary\u2019 interviews, there was no improvement in recall to the ASD children in the Sketch-RC or the other two interviews. This comes to question whether Sketch-RC does improve memory recall or were there methodological issues that caused the study to not find any significant results. This study did have its limitations, as Dando et al (2018) had brought this to light. Participants were aimlessly placed in either a live condition or a video condition, 83% of TD children and only 30% of ASD children were placed in the live condition. This could have impacted the significance of the results because ASD children are more perceptive of their surroundings, as they process sensory information around them differently (O\u2019Neill and Jones, 1997), therefore the children could have encoded the information differently when streaming a video version rather than witnessing the live event, impacting the validity of the results. Even though there might be drawbacks to the article\u2019s methodology to cause the results to not support sketch-RC, there are still several studies that reinforce the idea of how positive the sketch-RC can be in real life. For instance, a field study had looked into children\u2019s accounts of sexual abuse. The use of drawing had significantly increased the amount of detail recalled, rather than just a standard interview (Katz &amp; Hershkowitz, 2009). With this in mind, sketch-RC has shown to be valuable in the real world as well as in just studies, so police should highly consider using this method to capture more information. The takeaway message is that the MRC in a cognitive interview might not be an appropriate measure to gather information from ASD children. So, the use of sketch-RC might be considered more appropriate than MRC when conducting a cognitive interview for ASD children, as it allows them to access memories using the contextual cues from their sketches. This will be fairly important in real life as each information given by the witness can help in finding the perpetrator or piecing the investigation together. Consequently, social interaction is vital in police interviewing, as it requires a verbal exchange of information. However, ASD children tend to lack the social skills to interact and confidently communicate to get their ideas across (Knott et al., 2006). The cognitive interview, therefore, might pose a problem, as ASD children will consider it socially demanding (Johnson, et al., 2018), which might cause them to become distressed and impact their retrieval of information (Quas &amp; Lench, 2007). On account of this, the advancements in technology can allow police interviews to be conducted with robots rather than humans to minimise the distress (Wood et al., 2013). There have been significant benefits in the use of robots, as they have shown to improve the social skills of TD children (Robins et al., 2004; Aresti-Bartolome and Garcia-Zapirain 2014) and in ASD children (Wainer et al., 2010). The creation of \u2018Kinesics and Synchronization in Personal Assistant Robotics\u2019 (KASPAR) has shown to be beneficial to ASD children. An observational study had been conducted to see how children would react to the KASPAR with adults present (Robins et al., 2009). They had found that the ASD children interacted positively by smiling, touching, and gazing at the KASPAR. Also, an important finding they had found was that it helped facilitate social interactions with the co-present adult. This could be beneficial in police interviewing as it will help support the ASD child in feeling comfortable, but also can act as a social mediator for when ASD children are being interviewed. Nevertheless, evidence has shown that the KASPAR does come with its challenges, as a study had found that children were scared of viewing the robot because of how it looked (Huijnen et al., 2018). This would undermine the use of KASPAR, as it would cause further distress and impacting the ASD child\u2019s memory. Opposed to this view, a reinforcing study by Wood et al (2013) had comparable results to Robins et al (2009) using the KASPAR. However, the study involved the children to be interviewed in a similar manner to a police interview, as they had used questions that would retrieve facts and not feelings from the children. The eye gaze and interview duration were much longer when the interviewer was a KASPAR rather than a human. This key finding links with ASD children as eye contact is a necessary part of communication (Nation and Penny., 2008). This adds support to the use of KASPAR in police interviews as it will help ASD children to feel at ease and help in memory recall; but also this study helps put in perspective how the use of a robot could help ASD children in a police setting. ASD children\u2019s perception of the KASPAR allows us to understand why they feel more closer to robots than humans. They seem to identify them as toys (Peca et al., 2014) and neither a living nor non-living being (Kahn et al., 2012); suggesting that robots are seen as less intimidating than humans, which allows them to react to them in an anthropomorphic way. However, with the recent addition of rapport-building in the cognitive interview, it can be argued that there might not be a need for the KASPAR. As the rapport-building phase has demonstrated to make children feel comfortable and confide to the interviewer considerably more (Hershkowitz, 2011). In opposition to this, the use of robots has seemed to show the same effects as the rapport-building phase, as a study had shown that children were more likely to share the secret to the robot than to the teacher after being prompted equally in both conditions (Bethel et al., 2011). Therefore, the use of a robot could be more beneficial and less time consuming when gaining information from a child. In summary, the evidence above provides the KASPAR to accomplish what a human interviewer might not be able to in a cognitive interview. It suggests that the KASPAR can aid children in feeling relaxed, as this is important in salvaging memories of the witnessed event. But most importantly it can help the police interviewers by acting as a social mediator between the child and the interviewer. Police should therefore highly consider the use of a KASPAR for ASD children. To conclude, both uses of a sketch-RC and a humanoid robot appear to support ASD children in memory. Sketch-RC is an improvement from the standard MRC as it visually helps ASD children to see the contextual cues. The KASPAR also helps benefit in the interaction of the ASD child and the interviewer, which in turn allows the child to feel at ease and not impede their memory. Both recommendations have a significant amount of evidence to support their use, yet there have been a few limitations which interferes in their validity of being useful. It should however still be considered in the use of police interviews.", "positive": "... it might seriously be the lockdown getting to you Like afterwards it might be different Have you talked to him about this tho ?

{"id": "aug_466", "anchor": "Wasons selection task was influenced by how hypothesis testing should use the hypo deductive method. He invented 3 problems, including the Selection task. The selection task is a principal tool people use to find out whether their general statements are true. The abstract version includes 4 cards (a latter on one side and a number in the other) followed by conditional rules. However, despite the simplicity, people still tend to find the task difficult. Therefore, success in this task depends on the insight model (Jhonson-Laird &amp; Wason, 1972). The insight model involves 3 levels; During the first level people only focus on cards that confirm the rule. In level 2, people realise that both instances, conforming and falsifying the rule are important and lastly, people realise that the only cards that falsify the rule are important. However, according to the memory cueing hypotheses, concrete version of this task has been found to be easier than the abstract version, this is due to the content being familiar and dealt with in the past (Griggs &amp; Cox, 1982). Examples of the concrete version include the so-called drinking law problem; Griggs &amp; Cox, 1982. In this problem, the cards were labelled \u2018beer\u2019, \u2018coke\u2019, \u201922 years\u2019 etc. At which, participants were good in selecting the right cards. Further reasonings to explain the facility of this version of the task are the pragmatic reasoning schemas. The idea that people use context-dependent rules of interference. The most important of which, is the permission schema where people tend to perform better when a permission rule is involved. For example, \u2018if one acts A, then they must first satisfy a condition prior to it in which people did much better than on the traditional selection task. Similarity, the social contract theory states people tend to perform better when there are implied rules. However, critics about rules of permission and obligation (deontic reasoning).

{"id": "aug_470", "anchor": "Background Information Kenya Airways celebrated 43 years of operations in January 2020. However, according to passengers who have recently flown with Kenya Airways, the airline is performing poorly and not meeting customer expectations. Standards have decreased and the quality of the overall experience has worsened. Based on the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, this is evident. There have been many occurrences of lost luggage, poor customer service within the airport and on the aircraft, and insufficient in-flight entertainment. This report will address these complaints using the quantitative and qualitative data collected and analysed to make comparisons with and provide sufficient recommendations for improvement. Quantitative Research Secondary data, \"data previously collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand.\" (Malhotra, Nunan and Birks, 2017) was gathered for a 5-year period (2016 - 2020 inclusive). The data was then logged into an Excel spreadsheet, where the customer name, gender, travel month and year, cabin type i.e. economy, route i.e. international, origin and destination were provided along with the overall rating of the experience and individual rating of each characteristic. The sampling technique used was stratified sampling: \"\u2026a two-step process to partition the population into strata. Elements are selected from each stratum randomly.\" (Malhotra, Birks and Willis, 2013). Customers\u2019 reviews were picked based on the year but at random. This technique was also chosen due to its increased precision and the need to include important information i.e. all eight individual ratings completed. Customers who had not completed all eight reviews were ignored during the selection procedure as all eight reviews had to be completed to enable graphs to be drawn and comparisons and conclusions to be made. The question that rises from the data collected is: \"does gender influence the ratings of airline services?\" The two sample groups are male and female. A grouping variable t-test was carried out to work out the significance (appendix 2b). Since we have two groups, we want to compare the mean of \u2018Array 1\u2019 represented by males and \u2018Array 2\u2019 represented by females. As it is not known which gender scored a higher average rating, a two-tailed test using equal variances (2) needs to be carried out. Our results show a significance of 0.56 (to 2 d.p.), which indicates that it is not statistically significant. The significance value is more than 0.05 (p&gt;0.05) and the t-value is less than 1.96 (t&lt;1.96) which proves the results are not significant. Therefore, there is no difference in one gender rating services higher than the other, and there is no expectation that the differences will be replicated in other samples. To support this further, the airline characteristics ratings were split by gender, where the number of males were 50 and the number of females were 28. A table of the average individual ratings and standard deviation were recorded (appendix 2a) and a graph to represent the averages was drawn as shown on the next page. From the graph, it is evident that females gave lower ratings compared to males (except for \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019, where males rated it an average of 3.10 and females rated it 3.18). The biggest difference in ratings was for \u2018legroom\u2019 with a difference of 0.33. The standard deviation for males and females is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and there is a normal distribution. Therefore, it supports our hypothesis test of there not being a significant difference. An overall average airline rating was calculated and plotted in a graph as shown below. The graph shows that the most poorly rated characteristic was the \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 with a rating of 3.06. With all individual ratings being around 3, the overall rating can be assumed as an average of 3. We can compare these results with the overview of the official rating of the airline displayed on the TripAdvisor website (appendix 1b). The link for the website page is indicated by appendix 1c. The results are similar to the TripAdvisor ratings meaning the data collected is representative of the population. The standard deviation was also calculated for comparison and recorded in a table along with the averages (appendix 1a). From the table, it is evident that the standard deviation is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and that there is a normal distribution. To understand whether each characteristic has improved from 2016-2020, a table of averages was created (appendix 3). The table shows the total average for each year declining, where the best year was 2016 (average of 3.77) and the worst year was 2020 (average of 2.91) \u2013 the graph indicates this. A line graph was drawn to represent this information (below). The biggest decline was from 2019 to 2020, with a difference of 0.44. However, there was an improvement in the customer service from 2018-2019 with a rise of 0.57. In the year 2017, \u2018cleanliness\u2019 had the highest average (3.92) compared to the rest of the years. Again, this proves that quality of services has been declining. Therefore, the overall quality of characteristics has worsened. Qualitative Research To further support the quantitative analysis, secondary qualitative research was carried out. This was done by randomly selecting 25 customer reviews from the years 2016-2020 (5 for each year). All 25 reviews were analysed, and a coding frame (appendix 4a) was written up to categorise the factors further. For example, check-in and boarding was broken down into flights, luggage, and other. This was to understand in detail what the reviews highlighted. Appendix 4b indicates an example of an analysed positive review that includes characteristics such as value for money, check-in and boarding, seat comfort, food and beverage, and in-flight entertainment. For example, the customer (travel year 2020) commented on the \u2018seats being very comfortable\u2019. The average rating for seat comfort in 2020 was 3.10. Although there was a very minor decrease (0.05) from 2019, it can be assumed the seat comfort is steady and quality is not changing drastically. However, throughout the 5-year period, customer service was the most frequently complained about (airline staff and cabin crew) with a total of 12 negative complaints each. Airline staff includes staff who are not directly involved in the airport or aircraft, but are still part of Kenya Airways staff i.e. headquarters, call centres etc. The majority of complaints relating to airline staff were about staff being unfriendly, impolite, and incompetent. Some reviews mentioned that staff need to be trained as there was no sense of empathy. On the other hand, there was 1 positive review which mentioned the service being on a \u2018high level\u2019. Cabin crew also had 12 negative reviews, mostly about the staff not caring about errors made as well as not apologising. On the other hand, there were 9 positive reviews, making the total -3. This tells us that although there are positive customer service reviews, there are more negative ones meaning that customer service is worsening over the years. This can be also be proved by the graph shown by appendix 3 where the customer service rating fell from 2016 (4.00) to 2020 (2.90). This indicates greater confidence in customer service declining as there are frequent reviews to support this. Appendix 4c shows a negative review written by a customer in 2016. The review mentions customer service (airport staff and cabin crew) and food and beverage (qualityportion). Again, customer service was poor due to staff not caring or apologising. Furthermore, the airline had run out of vegetarian meals and no drinks were offered either. The coding frame shows the total for \u2018qualityportion\u2019 as -3, indicating that the airline is performing poorly in this service. Appendix 1a highlights that \u2018food and beverage\u2019 is the second lowest characteristic rated by customers with an average of 3.25. This supports the coding frame. On the other hand, there are three characteristics where the airline is performing well \u2013 legroom, seat comfort, and food and beverage \u2013 taste. The total scores based on the coding frame are 2, 3, and 2 respectively. Legroom had 2 positive reviews, both commenting on spaciousness, seat comfort had 4 positive reviews, and food and beverage \u2013 taste, had 4 positive reviews commenting on good and fresh taste. However, there were also negative reviews for seat comfort, where seats were not as comfortable and the taste of food not being great. Overall, Kenya Airways are doing well in these areas of service. Appendix 1a shows this for \u2018legroom\u2019 as it has the second highest average rating of 3.60, which supports the qualitative research and indicates greater confidence since reviews are consistent hence representative. Whilst appendix 4b has a positive review based on flying business class, other customers travelling in business class had negative experiences, based on poor customer service, rude staff and lost luggage. Therefore, this demonstrates inconsistency of the airline as customers are receiving different treatment even when demographics are the same. Rather, customers in business class are having the same issues as those travelling in economy, which raises the question as to whether Kenya Airways view all customers as equivalent despite paying extra for better service. Moreover, staff are lacking in training which leads to poor service regardless of whichever cabin customers are flying in. Recommendations Kenya Airways are performing at an average level (3.0) in comparison to competitors such as Qatar Airways (4.0) (Qatar Airways Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020) and Emirates (4.0) (Emirates Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020). While Kenya Airways are scoring close to an average rating of 4.0 in characteristics such as \u2018cleanliness\u2019 (3.71) and \u2018legroom\u2019 (3.60), they are scoring low in characteristics such as \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 (3.06) and \u2018food and beverage\u2019 (3.25) while receiving frequent complaints about services such as \u2018check-in and boarding\u2019 and \u2018customer service\u2019. Therefore, in order to excel, regain customer confidence and outperform competitors, many improvements need to be made throughout the airline. Firstly, improvements need to be made in customer service, mainly the airport staff and cabin crew. According to reviews on TripAdvisor, the cabin crew have a lack of care and are impolite towards passengers. As suggested by customers and to avoid future negative interactions with passengers, training needs to take place frequently e.g. every 4-6 months to ensure staff members are able to handle situations with care, show understanding and remain polite. Once training is complete, staff should be tested by answering scenario questions. Those who score less than 70% should undergo further training. The process can be repeated until they score 70% or over. Customers who feel comfortable and at ease are more likely to have a positive flight experience, resulting in greater positive reviews and higher ratings. Moreover, airport staff are being criticised of showing attitude and being unhelpful. Again, training needs to take place to avoid future negative experiences. A similar assessment as the cabin crew can be carried out with questions aimed more specifically for airport staff. Secondly, the in-flight entertainment needs to be improved. Passengers have complained about the equipment being broken and the movie list not being up to date. This can be quite frustrating especially when flying for long hours as there is no sufficient entertainment available to use. The first course of action should be for the movie listing to be updated (as mentioned in one review) on all aeroplanes and provide a wider array of entertainment as Emirates do (appendix 5). This will keep passengers entertained for the length of the flight. To avoid faulty equipment, all equipment should be checked before passengers aboard the plane. Finally, the portion and overall quality of food needs to be improved. There have been a number of complains written by customers who mention the portion size of food is little and sometimes drinks are not offered either. This can be seen as unacceptable, especially for those flying in businessfirst class as complimentary drinks are mandatory and passengers are paying extra (value for money). Portions need to increase as a result, by up to 25% to satisfy expectations and drinks need to be offered with every meal, as well as in between.", "positive": ", I was doing a role as this is what I am most interested in and enjoy it the most.

{"id": "aug_471", "anchor": "Over the last few years EMNE\u2019s have become more prominent within the globalised world we now live in. These firms have had a significant boost since 2002; also referred to as the \u2018going global era.\u2019 They tend to come from emerging, upper-middle income economies and developing countries and use a variety of entry modes such as joint ventures, strategic alliances and wholly owned subsidiaries (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). However, the majority choose to expand rapidly into developed countries using M&amp;A\u2019s and are late movers. A growing number of EMNE\u2019s are starting to dominate certain industries such as banking, telecommunications and engineering and outward FDI from emerging countries is increasing. For example, China has increased its presence within the Fortune 500 between 2004 and 2019; whilst the presence of US firms has started to decrease, showing the ever-growing dominance of EMNE\u2019s (Fortune Global 500, 2004,2019). There\u2019s several firms many of us from the western world may not have realised are owned by EMNE\u2019s, such as Tetley being owned by TATA \u2013 an Indian conglomerate; meaning it owns several different types of businesses and McVitie\u2019s being owned by Turkish EMNE, Yildiz Holding. This essay will highlight the key differences between MNE\u2019s and EMNE\u2019s and examine how effective current theories are at explaining outward FDI from emerging country multinationals and compare and contrast them to the more recent theories which have been developed; including the LLL model and Springboard theory. Some academics believe these new EMNE\u2019s have different motivations, which don\u2019t necessarily fit in with the traditional theories; whilst others think that these theories can be applied just as effectively as the newer ones. Key differences between traditional western MNE\u2019s and EMNE\u2019s Only a decade ago many EMNE\u2019s, which are booming today and challenging some of the most established MNE\u2019s in many industries, were marginal competitors. So how have they managed to do this in such a short space of time and be successful? It\u2019s important to look at the key characteristics of both traditional MNE\u2019s and the newer EMNE\u2019s to see what makes them so different. A main difference is the speed they internationalise. Many traditional MNE\u2019s expand gradually, following the Uppsala model whereby they expand into countries which are psychologically close considering factors such as, geography, shared language and shared cultures. On the other hand, EMNE\u2019s expand at a more accelerated pace. They do this to close the gap between their market reach and the global presence of MNE\u2019s from developed countries (Mathews, 2006). A good example of an EMNE which has expanded rapidly is Chinese firm Huawei. In just five years, despite starting as a domestic firm in 2001, it was operating in over 100 countries by 2006. It did this by providing solid technology at low prices and hiring low cost engineers at 20% of western rates. This allowed them to strongly compete against western MNE\u2019s and expand quickly (Fey et al, 2016). EMNE\u2019s also use latecomer advantage whereby they learn from mistakes of MNE\u2019s already established in the market and do better themselves. MNE\u2019s are essentially used as \u2018guinea pigs.\u2019 With regards to ownership advantages many MNE\u2019s have the required resources available to them internally; making this a big advantage if they were to expand into developing countries. However, EMNE\u2019s are sometimes seen as having weak ownership advantages, but many believe this is debatable as their institutional advantages are so strong and they can also just obtain resources and capabilities through M&amp;A\u2019s; which would naturally upgrade their ownership advantages. Institutional advantages are another key element to consider when comparing the firms. It\u2019s well documented that traditional MNE\u2019s have struggled significantly in countries with institutional voids as they\u2019re used to political stability; due to coming from countries with highly stable environments. As a result, they don\u2019t have the same experiences to cope with instability in the same way as EMNE\u2019S. New EMNE\u2019s are known to have this as a big advantage over traditional MNE\u2019s, as they\u2019re used to dealing and complying with discretionary and unstable governments in their domestic countries, therefore meaning they\u2019re better prepared to succeed in foreign countries with weak institutional environments (Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Genc, 2008). It\u2019s also believed that if EMNE\u2019s can successfully thrive in unstable developing countries, they most certainly can be successful in stable, developed countries. Finally, there\u2019s key differences in the organisational adaptability of MNE\u2019s versus EMNE\u2019s. It\u2019s believed that EMNE\u2019s are much more adaptable than MNE\u2019s which tend to suffer from inertia, by being stuck in their ways, as they have deeply ingrained values, cultures and organisational structures (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). Consequently, they tend to have lower success rates with M&amp;A\u2019s due to their lack of adaptability - almost two thirds of acquisitions by western firms end in failure, as the acquirer doesn\u2019t give flexibility to the firm acquired. On the other hand, EMNE\u2019s tend to have a high M&amp;A success rate - 67% success rate, as their adaptability is high, and they appreciate the firm they acquire more; due to their lack of global presence. Existing theories and their relevance Two major theories which explain the existing ways firms expand overseas successfully are Dunning\u2019s Eclectic Paradigm and the Uppsala Model. Dunning uses OLI theory to explain why firms use outward FDI; suggesting the key advantages as being ownership advantages, location advantages and internalisation advantages. Ownership advantages refer to valuable resources and capabilities a firm offers a country it expands into, which gives them a competitive advantage. Many argue that due to their lack of capabilities and resources, coming from developing countries, EMNE\u2019s can\u2019t satisfy this part of the OLI paradigm. Going by Dunning\u2019s explanation this would mean that they\u2019re unable to engage in outward FDI, however many still do and are proven successful. Furthermore, some believe EMNE\u2019s from developing countries could be considered to have ownership disadvantages, as they lack a well-known image and may not have the ability to compete on the same scale as western MNE\u2019s, who have larger finances and advanced technologies (Fey et al, 2016). In addition, location advantages are required by Dunning to expand overseas effectively; this is what host countries can offer to a firm undertaking FDI there (Dunning, 1979). However, many EMNE\u2019s don\u2019t go abroad to access location advantages, such as lower cost production, lower labour costs or cheaper technology; as they already have this available to them in their domestic markets. For example, many Chinese firms won\u2019t outsource their production to a developed country if they\u2019re to expand their firm into them, because it\u2019s well documented that production and labour within China can be done at a much cheaper cost to say that in the US. As both ownership advantages and location advantages aren\u2019t satisfied in the OLI paradigm, it makes it possible to say that the theory could become redundant or less relevant as more EMNE\u2019S become successful in developed markets; without having satisfied all three elements within the paradigm. Secondly, the Uppsala model is another model used to explain the internationalisation of firms. It emphasises how firms go abroad incrementally and increase commitments gradually. This may mean they go into countries close to their domestic market first. A firm may first export to a country, then open an overseas subsidiary and finally build or acquire their own factory abroad as they gain more knowledge about the market and establish their operations. EMNE\u2019S are unfortunately thought to leapfrog some steps outlined above and may even start the internationalisation process by becoming \u2018born global\u2019 and setting up the factory first. According to Eriksson et al (2000), the Uppsala Model is based on the idea that the behaviour of the internationalisation process is path dependent. Path dependence is a process based on the accumulated knowledge from the firm\u2019s past international experience, which directs the firm\u2019s future trajectory (Eriksson et al, 2000). A main concern is that Uppsala explains this path dependence but EMNE\u2019s have no experience in developed countries to use. As a result, they can only use knowledge of developing countries. On the other hand, MNE\u2019s know all about operating in developed markets so are at a bigger advantage. Finally, part of the Uppsala model is the idea of psychic distance - entering countries psychologically close. A main issue with this idea is that EMNE\u2019s may not be able to use psychic distance to enter developed countries because they\u2019re so different in nature. For example, developing countries may have stronger cultural, language, political and legal differences to developed countries. This would also be the case for MNE\u2019s looking to expand into developing countries. The development of new theories As time has progressed new theories have been developed to try to explain and analyse how these new EMNE\u2019s have used outward FDI to expand their presence internationally. The reason for creating these theories is because many couldn\u2019t understand how these firms from countries with weaker country specific advantages could compete against the firms from developed countries. At first glance, it appears these EMNE\u2019s have weaker firm specific advantages compared to their western rivals. The springboard theory was created (Luo and Tung, 2007) to explain why these firms expand so aggressively and the drivers behind this. The theory highlights seven elements. The first being that EMNE\u2019s use their international expansion to compensate for their ownership disadvantages; this means that to counteract the fact they can\u2019t offer a lot initially in terms of resources to the new market, they expand internationally and benefit from other means such as gaining resources from another firm through a M&amp;A. Immediately, this makes the OLI paradigm seem less relevant, as it\u2019s highlighting that they can still be a success without initial ownership advantages. The second element of the theory says that EMNE\u2019s use the international expansion to overcome their latecomer disadvantage; this means that they benefit from being able to see where MNE\u2019s have made mistakes and ensuring they don\u2019t make the same ones. Next, it explains that MNE\u2019s from developing countries use international expansion as a springboard to counter-attack global rivals\u2019 major foothold in their home country market. It also outlines that EMNE\u2019s use outward FDI as a springboard to bypass certain trade barriers, such as quotas and anti-dumping penalties. This means that they go into another developingemerging markets with fewer restrictions. For example, if a Chinese firm were to set up a foreign subsidiary or production in Mexico and then export their good to the US. This again goes against the OLI paradigm as the firm isn\u2019t directly using the location advantages of the US for production in the example above. Instead, they\u2019re choosing to use those of Mexico to then sell in the US. Furthermore, the theory says new emerging MNE\u2019s expand internationally to alleviate domestic institutional constraints. This for example could be if their home country doesn\u2019t have strong patent laws, so they take their product elsewhere to be better protected therefore, benefitting from the county\u2019s location advantage of having stronger patent protection. The final two elements explain that EMNE\u2019s use international expansion to both secure preferential treatment offered by emerging governments and exploit their competitive advantage in other markets. To secure preferential treatment a domestic firm, say an Indian firm, may set up a subsidiary within the UK and then invest back into India to gain the tax benefit and the preferential government treatment. A second new theory developed is the LLL model (Mathews, 2006). This model has similarities to the Springboard theory in the way it explains why EMNE\u2019s expand and internationalise. However, the key takeaway is that it says EMNE\u2019s go abroad and then they learn. This is a massive contrast to the Uppsala model which emphasises the gradual process of expansion and firms using the knowledge they already possess to expand into markets with similarities, that are psychologically close. Firms going abroad and then learning highlights a more aggressive approach to expansion. The three L\u2019s in the model stand for linkage, leverage and learning. The linkage element examines the collaborations between EMNE\u2019s and foreign firms through entry modes such as joint ventures, M&amp;A\u2019s and alliances. Leverage explains that EMNE\u2019s exploit global linkages to become \u2018latecomers\u2019 by harnessing resources and cost advantages to compete globally. The second \u2018L\u2019 really highlights the idea that firms go abroad and then learn from the foreign partners already in the market and demonstrates why Dunning\u2019s theory is less relevant of initially having certain ownership advantages to be successful. Finally, the learning element is the stage where EMNE\u2019s acquire competitive advantages and learn how to compete internationally. Firms don\u2019t need initial advantages necessarily; as they can expand and then learn and therefore become competitive. Overall, this model argues that firms acquire resources and learn over time before internationalisation occurs and the EMNE is integrated into the international activities. Although these theories have been developed and are more tailored to the new types of EMNE\u2019s, they do still have their drawback such as underestimating the importance of absorption capacity and they go against the path dependence theory; as expressed in the Uppsala model. Finally, it\u2019s clear that the importance of ownership advantages is dismissed; which is a key element in the existing OLI paradigm. In summary, it\u2019s evident EMNE\u2019s and traditional MNE\u2019s differ both in the way they operate and the way they internationalise. Key differences include the speed EMNE\u2019s internationalise compared with MNE\u2019s and how differently they use or even don\u2019t use their initial ownership advantages to ensure success abroad. Although they have their differences, both types of firm have proven to be successful in their own ways. However, there\u2019s still a huge question mark over how these newer EMNE\u2019s have prevailed so much globally. Thus, newer theories have been developed to try and explain this dominance. It must be said that although these new theories more accurately explain the rapid growth of EMNE\u2019s and why having ownership advantages isn\u2019t as essential as some older theories may suggest; they do still have their criticisms, as explained above. Consequently, further theories may have to be developed which are more accurate and less open to scrutiny. However, it really depends on individual views as to which theories are considered more relevant. Some would argue Dunning and the Uppsala model have been used for many years and can still be used effectively today, whilst others may say the world is constantly changing, as seen with the recent rise of EMNE\u2019s, and therefore it\u2019s necessary to keep developing and updating new theories. This will make them most effective and relevant to the current situations firms and countries find themselves in. For example, Carl Fey and others developed a new 5M framework which guides academics in their understanding of the internationalisation of EMNE\u2019s (Fey et al, 2009). It proved that internationalisation is challenging for any firm. The largest challenge for EMNE\u2019s, which is not always covered by the older theories, is overcoming the problem of a negative country image (Y.Y. Chang et al., 2009; E.Chang &amp; Taylor., 1999; Ferner et al., 2005; Smith &amp; Meiksins, 1995). It\u2019s the job of newer theories to potentially provide insight into how EMNE\u2019\u2019s can overcome this challenge.", "positive": "nk you.

{"id": "aug_479", "anchor": "In this essay, I will mention the key features of the psychodynamic approach, such as Freud and the unconscious mental processes, and those of the biological approach \u2013 genetics, heredity and evolution. Core assumptions, such as the role of nature and nurture in the key features, will also be remarked upon and compared. This essay will allude to how these perspectives are different, their stands on the nature-nurture debate, and how they are similar \u2013 such as the influence of childhood. The key features of the psychodynamic approach are mostly synonymous to Sigmund Freud, and his research with unconscious mental processes. This approach focuses on the influence of the \u2018unconscious\u2019 and how our behaviour as adults is rooted from childhood experiences (Jarvis, 2000). Freud derived theories about the mind and personalities, coming up with theory about the conscious, preconscious and unconscious, how Freudian slips showed what you are truly thinking but trying to hide, and the It (Id), I (Ego), and above-I (superego) (Freud, 1993 as cited in Jarvis, 2000). This means that this approach looks at how past experiences are reflected in current behaviour. Like the psychodynamic approach, the biological approach has a researcher well known to the field \u2013 Charles Darwin. The key features of this approach focus on the role of genetics and evolution. Evolution refers to the way genes in our DNA can change over generations due to the role of \u2018natural selection\u2019. Twin studies have been helpful in researchers understanding to the extent genes play a role in behaviour and how much the environment may play a role in this also. For example, twin and adoption studies show how the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher if you are genetically similar than dissimilar (environment also plays a role as concordance is not 100%) - Cardno &amp; Gottesman (2000). This means that this approach focuses on the interaction of genes and the environment - how nature can influence nurture and nurture can influence nature. A difference between these approaches, is the way that these perspectives view the influence of nature and nurture. The psychodynamic approach concentrates on the role of the unconscious and childhood experiences being the influence on adult behaviour. Therefore, psychoanalysts, such as Freud,, emphasise the role of nurture over nature. In contrast, the biological approach concentrates on the way nature and nurture have a similar influence on each other \u2013 the role of genetics as well as environmental influences. Another similarity with the approaches is that they both have socially sensitive research that have impacted on people negatively. According to Jarvis (2000), in the 1950s and 1960s, psychiatrists following psychodynamic concepts blamed autism on poor parenting. Tavris and Wade (1997) [as cited in Jarvis (2000)] described a case study that illustrated the negatives of taking a purely psychodynamic approach. This approach is reductionist. Its theories are derived from case studies such as Anna O and the work or Tavris and Wade and it tries to explain everything in accordance to psychodynamic theories. Reductionist approaches included socially sensitive research which as a result significantly harmed people \u2013 like the eugenics movement. The work of Galton, fixated on the role of genetics, influencing the eugenics movement. His focus on certain traits being better in society and the fixation that these traits are hereditary only led to the research being abused and hurting thousands of people (Fairholm, 2011). Eugenics was very popular to begin with but eventually it led to a way to discriminate, segregate and sterilise (,and in Nazi Germany, systematically murder) millions of people deemed to have undesirable genes. This dark side of psychology was reductionist and ethically immoral. The eugenics movement attempted to use just genes to explain everything about people. As a result, by focusing only on genes and inheritance, the importance of the environment was ignored (Fairholm, 2011). Neurodevelopmental disorders show that genes are not the only factor to developing a disorder, for example, while Fragile X Syndrome is a purely genetic disorder, Down Syndrome and Williams Syndrome are not hereditary (passed from parents to offspring) even though its genetic, and Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is purely environmental \u2013 no genetic origin. (Witton, C., 2019). This means that separating genes and the environment is not appropriate as neurodevelopmental disorders here show that nature has influence over nurture (Fragile X Syndrome) and nurture has influence over nature (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). The understanding developed from biological theories and discoveries has aided in pharmacological treatment for psychological disorders and the potential understanding on how these disorders develop. The discovery of neurones (by von Waldeyer-Hartz) and eventual discovery of the Synapse (by Sir Charles Sherrington) led to the unearthing of neurotransmitters and their functions \u2013 and their influence on the brain and psychological disorders such as serotonin with depression. This has led to biopsychology to be considered scientific due to objective and controlled research. Similar to this, Freudian theory on ego defences such as displacement, denial and projection are considered today in psychodynamic therapy. These are considered in therapy as psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals, see psychological problems as rooted in childhood and dealing with the root cause, and gaining insight into trauma, can help relieve symptoms. An example of this used in the past would be the case study of Anna O \u2013 bringing trauma into the consciousness by talking about it resolved the symptoms of her hysteria. However, this approach includes vague untestable concepts that lack specifics required to assist in Psychology being considered a science. For example, the Oedipus Complex is almost impossible to measure and the use of case studies, such as Anna O reduces the validity of this approach and it being scientific as participants are not typical of the population. (Jarvis, 2000) Anna O is a case study in the psychodynamic approach which focused on how the mind served to adapt the individual to the environment. The mind presents hysteria to unresolved trauma, the mind adapting the individual to its environment and past experiences. Based on this, I suggest that psychodynamic approach has functionalist perspectives. However, with Freud\u2019s insistence of interpreting and analysing dreams, this approach has certain structuralist qualities. The psychodynamic philosophy analyses the mind based on behaviour that presents itself, such as Freudian slips and dreams, which is partially what structuralism is based upon. Therefore, the psychodynamic approach is an interaction of functionalism and structuralism with a lean towards functionalism. Similarly, the biological approach can be viewed to be an interaction of structuralism and functionalism. The approach analyses the mind and localises areas for specific jobs, such as with genetics and chromosome x or y on the last pair which determines gender or Broca\u2019s area for speech aphasia. This is structuralist. Where this approach links with functionalism is through evolution. Where the mind has adapted an individual to their environment. This is evident with evolutionary fears \u2013 such as fear of heights, the dark and snakes. This behaviour increased survival in the past. Another example of this is the cuteness of babies. This is also a survival factor as infants are unable to look after themselves. As a result, this \u2018cuteness\u2019 factor elicits a caregiving response and the need to look after infants and protect them from the dangers. (Kringelbach, Stark, Alexander, Bornstein &amp; Stein, 2016). A similarity between the biological and psychodynamic approach are that both are deterministic approaches rather than demonstrating free will in their theories. While the biological approach approaches the nature and nurture debate as it being an interaction between the two, it is largely a deterministic approach rather than free will. Biological determinism is where biological concepts or processes determine our thoughts and behaviours (Fairholm, 2011). This approach rejects a total genetic viewpoint, especially because of the eugenics movements, but elements of this approach is still deterministic. An example would be the argument for the MAOA gene and aggression. Some have argued in the past that because one may have this gene and commit and act of aggression, this excuses their behaviour. However, this cannot be accepted in the current Criminal Justice system and that people must take responsibility for their actions as other people with this gene can control their aggression (Holmgren &amp; Winterdyk, 2011). This example shows that the biological approach focuses on deterministic theories rather than free will. Moreover, the psychodynamic approach leans more on determinism than free will. This is evident in the fact that Freudian concepts argue that behaviour in the current is influenced by past experiences in childhood. This leaves little room for free will as a result. Another example is through the ego defences suggested by Freud. These are considered an automatic phenomenon to protect a person from their trauma, for example repression of trauma or displacing anger from the object of their anger to someone more vulnerable \u2013 the person isn\u2019t aware they are doing this consciously. Therefore, this removes the aspect of free will. At first glance, one would assume that the biological approach and the psychodynamic approach are different, that because one focuses on genetics and evolution and the other focuses on early childhood experiences and the unconscious, that there are no similarities. However, this essay shows that, aside from the basic key features, the perspectives are more similar than first assumed. They have people that are well known to their areas \u2013 Freud and Darwin. Furthermore, both indicate that childhood has influence over behaviour \u2013 the unconscious desire and fears presented in Freudian theory and environmental influences on typical body development (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). There are differences in the perspectives, such as the psychanalytical approach considering nurture to have more influence but the biological approach considering the interaction of nature and nurture having equal amount of effect on behaviour. In conclusion, the biological and psychodynamic are much more similar than what would first be assumed.", "positive": "just wanted to check \ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude02 ish.

{"id": "aug_480", "anchor": "Dear CEO, With regards to your upcoming conference in Helsinki from the 2nd to 4th September, I have researched and identified the relevant itinerary items for your trip. - I have identified two potential accommodations within the \u00a3200 per night budget: 1. Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for \u00a3308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for \u00a3250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra \u00a316 per night (totalling \u00a3342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay. If you could please review my recommendations and let me know if you think they are appropriate so that I can pass them onto the travel department to do the booking.

{"id": "aug_490", "anchor": "Aims and Research Questions The topic of research being discussed in this essay is one of the experiences during a pandemic. This was chosen as a topic of research as it is interesting to see what experiences people going through during a pandemic. It is a situation which we are all facing and gaining a deeper insight into a particular individuals experience can allow us to overcome the likely feelings of going through the pandemic alone. Thus, the main research question was: \u2018How has living in a global pandemic affected one\u2019s life?\u2019. From this, a semi- structured interview schedule was created containing open-ended questions with impromptu follow up questions to encourage free accounts and detailed responses (Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003). Interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) as a suitable method: Using IPA allows us to gain what Conrad (1987) terms as an \u2018insider\u2019s perspective\u2019. We are submerged into one\u2019s personal experience where we try to make sense of how they view the world and use that information as a basis for interpretation. We are not taking a holistic view but rather identifying and acknowledging that every detail that has been spoken upon adds to the view that one has of the pandemic, hence the idiographic approach. This is contrasted with discourse analysis where the pandemic would be viewed as a \u2018social construct\u2019 and one would deconstruct what is being said and how language is used to construct our experience of the pandemic and whether that is a normalised concept in society (Wood, 2000). In using IPA, we look beyond COVID 19 as a pandemic, but delve deeper into how it has impacted an individual\u2019s life. This is done through a double hermeneutic approach (Giddens,1987) hence a bottom-up analysis of data. The data was read through several times, each time noting language use, phrases and emergent feelings that stand out. Emerging themes were then transformed from the notes and commonalities between themes were combined into majorsub themes, allowing for analysis of data through a chain of connections. Analysis This major theme aims to capture the difficulties living during a global pandemic. In this unpredictable circumstance, it is evident that it is taking a toll on Mia as here we see her use negative language whilst explaining what she is going through. The sense of the pandemic being a difficult circumstance was made evident through the repetition of \"unfortunate\" which was mentioned three times during the interview. This repetition resonates with an individual thus spotlighting how bad her experience is. Mia is unable to shake the ill feelings off and due to this, it is likely that Mia cannot help but call the circumstance unfortunate as it seems like it is the only key word that can truly capture what the feeling is like. Social interactions due to government lockdowns has meant that Mia has been unable to socially interact with others as she would have done previously and as this is an unchanging circumstance, Mia has likely come to terms with it and accepted it through the \"unfortunate\" being paired with \"\u2026it is what it is\". It suggests her experience serves some kind of ambiguity and later elaborates the effects of this ambiguity by saying the situation \"is out of my control\", rendering her useless in a sense. Mia\u2019s emphasis on the word \"much\" denotes a significant emotional toll on her, regardless of anything else that may be happening in her life. This is in contrast to how life was pre-pandemic as she describes it as being \"WAY WAY better\", the expressed emphasis on \"WAY\" announces how much happier Mia was before this happened, showing the drastic shift in life experiences for Mia. Similarly, we see Mia go through a phase of disconnection \u2013 \"for example (.) yeah)\". This incomplete sentence signifies Mia trying to disengage from the situation, perhaps as a coping mechanism. She later admits that life has acutely changed as she knows one, including herself, now has to be \"careful\" when living life, bringing to light the sombre undertones of it all. Here, Mia is actively aware that the difficulties she is currently facing is for the good of the wider society. She displays an act of selflessness, moving towards the viewpoint that what the government is trying to do to keep everyone safe is a good thing thus providing a contrast to the difficulties she faces. This provides a turning point to Mia\u2019s attitude as it reveals that her subconscious knows that this is a serious, unpredictable matter that needs addressing. The issue on mental health has clearly impacted Mia and has thus shaped her perception of what we call \u2018freedom\u2019. She no longer takes it for advantage, but rather takes it into her stride and appreciates the efforts taken by government to ensure all people are well and safe. Here, we get a sense of her deeper emotions during the pandemic and thus this quotation calling for a double entendre. First, the likely obvious meaning of Mia feeling hidden or concealed from the world, mainly due to the lockdowns mentioned during the interview. This is coincided with her emphasis on the word \"definitely\" when asked about her lost connections during the period of lockdown. It is evident that her relationships outside of her family meant a lot to her as she describes the experience as being \"really tough\", adding to the feeling of being hidden thus indicating that the relations have influenced part of her experience and has somewhat shaped her current identity and how she is managing to cope as she is lost in something that is so big However, in saying this, we also see a shift in her feeling \"shrouded\" as due to the connection with her friends drifting away, other, stronger, connection was being built with her family. She states, \"felt more connected to my family\". As this connection has been made stronger, Mia\u2019s sense of feeling \"shrouded\" disappears and we see her experience being shed in a much more positive light \u2013 \"it\u2019s made me feel better about the whole situation\". She has used her family as a way of accommodating her feeling hidden and lonely, having left university and most of her friends. Lines 38-39 indicates that Mia is trying to escape her mental health issues, almost as if she is begging and crying out for help as she wants to be able to do the things that she could do beforehand without any restrictions. It is evident that affirmations have somewhat aided in Mia\u2019s recurrent undesirable experience, especially through the repetition of \"I believe\". It is as if Mia is seeking reassurance within herself for her experiences, she is trying to keep up the feelings of optimism however, her subconscious knowledge of how bad the situation is, is hindering the positivity she is trying to portray. Thus, through this emphasis, we gain a possible insight into Mia\u2019s way of gaining control in her life, considering the unpredictability of the pandemic. \"We will get back to normality as if nothing ever happened. Life will return back to how it was before\" Here, Mia is explaining and imagining what the foreseeable future is going to hold for her, allowing her to relieve the weight of the pandemic off her shoulders. She plans to endeavour on her future plans. Nonetheless, this comes from Mia straying away from the question, seemingly getting carried away by her imagination, \"(.) lol anyways, back to working as a carer\", snapping back to reality, showing that her current experience seems to shift her focus in everyday life, even when speaking on something that is not directly linked to the pandemic. Conclusion COVID 19 seems to be more than just a \u2018pandemic\u2019. It is the one thing that we have all experienced and have in common; whether that may be for the good or bad. For some, it has been an experience of self-actualisation, a time where you find your flaws and develop them for the better. Others, however, share the same experience as Mia where it has not been such an easy journey this year considering she was battling her mental health and dealing with the loss of social relations However, in light of such a bleak situation, Mia remains hopeful about the foreseeable future, even going as far as stating what she will be able to do once the pandemic is over knowing that the situation will eventually get better. From this and the stronger connections made in her family, it is evident Mia has empowered herself which has obviously helped her significantly during these stressful times. As we all share similar aspects of Mia\u2019s experience, we should all remain hopeful and learn to manage and cope with our emotions by seeing the pandemic as an opportunity for growth and connecting with people on deeper levels in order not to feel isolated and alone.", "positive": "The Seaside Downtown Apartment offers a great waterfront view and not too far from central Helsinki.

{"id": "aug_492", "anchor": "How can media be simultaneously supporting and endangering our democracy? In recent years, there has been a profound dispute regarding the institution of media and the part it plays for crippling ethical principles within a democracy. My argument in this essay is that both these processes have a pivotal role to play in facilitating and hindering societal growth. Regardless of these, we should work to fortify this institution as both factors are necessary for the growth of our democracy and this institution has a fundamental role to play in protecting the interests of all citizens as well as promoting equality. The power of media has been constantly viewed in terms of the ability of a single individual or group to enforce order and command authority over a vast number, enabling the entity to hold power over something like a media environment with ease (Freedman a 2014, pp.11). This resulted in weakening the public domain via undermining the autonomy and wide range of diversity that is necessary for democracy to take place effectively. As an example, take Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, who has an immense amount of power, control and influence, some might even say that it is unprecedented. The most troublesome element of Facebook is Zuckerberg\u2019s ability to manipulate and influence the data of two billion people (Hughes, 2019, pp.7). Over the years, Zuckerberg has accumulated a few companies such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The sheer amount of unparalleled control and influence that a single individual has is staggering. In addition, this immense level of power that Zuckerberg has at his disposal is unwanted and undemocratic. The reasoning being that such an extensive amount of power, no matter how good the intentions, does instigate corruption. There is the constant risk of using this kind of concentrated power, especially when left unchecked, for personal use and this, in turn, is dangerous (Freedman b 2014, pp.319-334). To put it into perspective Facebook uses the medium of media to get people to use its products. Then, they use the response of that individual to manufacture more data, making Facebook\u2019s ability to calculate what you will do in a situation pervasive and a threat to democracy. (Zuboff 2018, pp. 287-289). Furthermore, another detrimental effect of democracy is that it risks the wrong choice of public servant. In this regard, the election of Donald Trump is an apt example. As Facebook has one of the most advanced predictive systems in the world, Trump was able to use this to his advantage by using the analytic data collected by Facebook. There were able to connect the files of voters to individual behaviour and then show specific ads that correlated with their voting patterns. Since winning the election Trump\u2019s bizarre behaviour combined with his delusional ideas continually reinforces the fact that he is not fit to rule America and the main aid here was Facebook, which propelled the success of his election undermining the government (Bump 2018, p.1-2). Another factor is not adequately allowing individuals the right to vote. The devastating impact, which media has on our democracy is still present. Individuals can vote for individuals based on certain factors, such as how their ideology matches with the running candidate or something as fickle as admiring the appearance of the candidate. This can lead to bias where an individual is more likely to pick a candidate if their beliefs are aligned with theirs (Caselli, F 2007, pp1-3) These factors may not even have anything to do with how capable and well suited they are for the job. In the case of America, this worsened the fact that many states where Trump\u2019s opposition received their votes were \"slave states\". There was an agreement made in the US constitution where every enslaved individual would only count as 35ths of a person (Acharya, A et al 2015, pp.4-7). This meant that even if more votes were obtained by other political candidates they would count as lesser votes overall, reducing their viability. In addition to this, there are profound issues when it comes to the topic of elite ownership and media power. Many individuals in the ruling class vigorously compete for power and ownership, which include the self-regulating ability to overcome democratic blocks (Marx 2010[1867] pp.8- 11). These individuals, known as the elite of society, often have a significant role to play in the media and the various ways that individuals, by certain messages, are susceptible to whatever the outlet portrays. They can use the controlling stakes they have in companies to get across a message that they want or control elements of news programs, newspapers and magazines all to the detriment of the working class and the surrounding institutions of society. Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet and Rupert Murdoch to name a few individuals who have bought controlling shares in media outlets. Rupert Murdoch, it can be said that he simply has too much power over the British state. (Helm, T et al 2011, pp1). Between them, they own media companies such as the Washington post and the Wall Street Journal, only further emphasising how the elite can hinder democracy. A sizeable number of shares bought by an individual would leave a company\u2019s rule to one individual, especially with social media companies (Mills, C.W 1959:3-27). In this case, the media is hindering democracy since it is allowing certain individuals to misuse and manipulate public resources. This is because considering the amount of power that individuals can obtain over public and private sectors, to the point where they can influence and predict whom you vote for via subliminal messaging or manipulating your data to benefit their agendas. They can even go the extent of using your data to predict with a high degree of accuracy the way you will behave and the resultant impact on democracy. For example, the analytic data that Facebook collected and how it assisted Trump\u2019s election. The possibilities are innumerous as to how they can exert their power. As a result, unethical practices are perpetuated, and the consequence is even more power and control which leads to a vicious cycle whereby the elite act in favour of the action which will provide them with the most benefit. These processes cripple democracy and making it feel more like a bureaucracy. Alternatively, even though the media can hinder democracy, there are ways that the media can support it, even strengthening it. One of these ways is that it protects the interest of its members. Democracy is unique in the sense that it allows people to get personally involved within their government. One way to achieve this is through social media platforms. In this way, the public have a sense of autonomy and a voice to speak up for themselves as to how they would prefer the running of their country. The choice is solely theirs as to whom they would want to elect depending on a wide range of reasons. One reason could be they think about who could, in the best way, represent their interests as well as benefit the country. Thus, giving the people free rein to choose whatever they like which also means that they could choose to not vote at all if they so wish. Everyone\u2019s opinions, through their votes, are included. This is regardless of them being in the majority or not, which appeases the public and makes them more amiable to the idea of democracy (Caplan 2007, pp.3-7) Moreover, promoting equality positively is significantly beneficial to democracy. Through using a democratic system, which connects relationally with media, a person is free to explore differentiating arguments of the running candidates, a party\u2019s manifesto details and any other details they could ever want to know. The fairness of this process is further emphasised by the fact that, regardless of social or economic background, public opinion is given. Even if you are wealthy or poor, have a lavish or humble lifestyle, under democracy your rights to vote are equal. Media only enhances the available opportunities. As a result, giving the liberal opportunity to engage in a political process in which you feel inclined towards since in the pure sense of democracy there is no bias or favouritisms. The media, being the main means of mass communication, is an enabler for democracy as having more educated voters can lead to a more legitimate government. Due to this media encourages mass participation and extends the reach that democracy can have over a country. This is beneficial as the institutions surrounding society also get strengthened as a result of the positive and consistent messages being promoted (Parsons 1992[1951] pp.45-51).Additionally, as larger numbers involved within a democracy means that a fairer and more representative process can take place and having an unrestricted, educated and varied choice enhances this. Thus, as individuals can make an informed decision how they want to engage in democratic practices, there is a higher degree of transparency within the government and that encourages more trust and in turn, makes democracy as fair and just of a system as possible (Katona, 2015 pp.359-394) For example, during elections there are several messages given about institutions, using the medium of media, such as education and health care. These include ideas such as improving the levels of education by developing a better curriculum and allocating more resources to ensure that students have a better overall quality of learning. Also, regarding the health care system the promise of more nurses, to improve the quality of service. Via this method, individuals engage within their political environment more if they know they are going to benefit as a result. So, as the surrounding institutions that underpin society strengthen, society becomes more stable. These institutions work synergistically building momentum of one another to reach a common social goal, stability (Canon, W.B 1987, pp.170-176). Thus, making it unavoidable for democracy to improve as well. Within a country, the group with the power to govern a country and its business is the government. This entity uses the tool of media to aid them in bettering the quality of democracy for everyone and strive to withhold the principles that their position stands for, which include the responsibilities they have to their nation. To hinder the monopoly of authorities, democracy needs to flourish. The state assists with this as the elected leaders are only in power for a certain period, so it is in their best interest to enforce the successful delivery of their promised policies, which benefit the people as well as their tenure but only if they are willing to do so. They are varied ways and methods in which they monopolise authority, a few of these being price capping and quality regulation (Bourdieu 1991[1982 pp.242-245]).Without the latter businesses would continuously put prices higher at a competitive rate leading to a decline in consumer welfare as well as lead to inefficiency. With the former, they can check the provision of good quality service as leaving businesses to their own devices will result in reluctance to keep the standards high. All this resulting in more stable democratic institutions. Nonetheless, government institutions, like any other institutions, are susceptible to exploitation as the elected use their position to support their own agenda, often using illegitimate means to get ahead. Furthermore, a beneficial point for media supporting democracy is that the structure of democracy works to reduce exploitation by spreading out the power that the role gives through bodies or committees who oversee the individual making sure no one has overarching power over the system. It is the fact that this task allows for easy power distribution, giving an equal opportunity for all (G\u00fcndemir, S. et al. 2017, pp.34-41). Within the government, the component of freedom usually allows individuals to act however, they want so long it is not at the detriment of others. Inside the structure of democracy, the population is free to act in any way they desire to seek any result. However, legal barriers restrict them, as they cannot go out of their way to harm another without repercussions. This governing structure grants the opportunity to pursue different careers and opportunities as well as giving a genuine voice to the people. Media is the thing that encourages such diversity, as you are free to express your own opinion and determine many lifestyle choices. Neither the communication tool, known as the media, is all-knowing nor is it useless. This tool can be capable of a vast amount such as altering the state and nature of dynamic relations within society for the better alongside mistaking acts and events creating a strain within society (Corner, 2011, pp.27-30). (For example) Due to the reasons mentioned, media can be a force for progressive change as well as a hindrance. It is safe to say that the media has a pivotal part to play within society, serving a variety of functions, and has multiple uses. Previously, having seen that the media can help the development of democracy, via methods such as promoting equality and the interest as citizens, individual trust within this process increases. Moreover, knowing that the media has the capacity to obstruct democracy. I am going to propose the argument that the media can neither endanger nor support democracy because it does not hold any power in and of itself. This communication outlet is merely the space in which power resides (Castells, 2009, pp.193). Therefore, media is not the chief proponent but merely hosts the interplay of power, control and dominance. It opens a vast space where people can come and hold power in areas such as business and politics (Freedman a, 2014, pp.11). Communication networks are central to this process and are key sources in society for it to hold power. The media agents involved help to spread this diverse message and engage in this with the end goal of altering the nature of the state (Castells, 2009, pp. 302-3). The problem has never been determining media\u2019s influence with assisting or deteriorating the economic situation, it is more to do with who occupies and aggregates the larger sources of information and the amount of space they take within this network. Media\u2019s main strength comes from the intertwining of various communication networks such as business, finance etc. Media weakens by the absence of news existing in some form or another within this domain. If there is nothing to occupy the space, then the impact of media is lackluster (Castells,2009, pp.194-195). Media cannot hold power over individuals of its own accord, it requires the strategic implementation of information from a combination of areas compiled into one place which then goes on to infiltrate all elements of social life. Conclusively, the relationship between media and democracy is extensive and far-reaching. Power, being ubiquitous in nature, seeps into the depths of media outlets and political institutions such as democracy. The power of media transcends merely control and is something far more perplexing. Even though we can see ways that media can assist and hinder democracy, its actual role is far greater and bewildering. I propose that more research is needed into the true nature of media and the way that its role functionally relates to different institutions, as well as the devastating impact it can have on society.", "positive": ", I just thought I\u2019d let you know I won\u2019t be able to attend lunch but I hope you guys have a good time and doesn\u2019t forget the key.

{"id": "aug_498", "anchor": "Abstract: This experiment investigates the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) using a cued visual attention task through an electroencephalogram (EEG). The predictions for this study are that alpha activity would be higher for the left parietal lobe in the cue left (Cl) condition rather than cue right (Cr). 39 psychology students performed visual attention task and were cued to expect the stimulus on either the right or left. This study found that the left condition did have higher alpha amplitudes in comparison to the right condition when recording for P3. The findings for this study supported previous research and found that in conclusion the alpha inhibition is indicative of attention. Introduction: \u2018High alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas\u2019 (Kilesch 2007) and is also reduced in task relevant brain areas. The findings of Handel et al (2011) showed that the stimuli presented to the participants visually were processed on the opposite side of the brain to where the stimuli were, and it is contralateral to the unattended side showing significantly higher alpha power. The results show that if a stimulus was to be presented on the left-hand side, it will be processed on the right side of the brain. A study by Sauseng et al (2005) which is being partially replicated by this study, asked participants to conduct a cued visual attention task and focused on different regions of the brain. The participants responded to a stimulus on a screen after being presented with an arrow that was an indication of which side the stimulus would appear on. The results show the side of the brain in which the stimuli had been processed, will obtain less alpha. There was also a significant effect of cue 200ms prior to stimulus onset recording from P3. These studies all show that alpha activity will be higher on the ipsilateral side in which the stimuli is shown, this supports the AIH. Therefore, supporting studies suggest that the hypothesis for this study is that the alpha amplitude would be higher in the Cl than the Cr, when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe. Method: Participants: A total of 39 undergraduate psychology students volunteered to be a participant, they were split into 5 groups. Design: The study was a repeated measures design as each participant saw both Cl and Cr conditions. The independent variable is the direction of the cue consisting of 2 levels whether it was left or right, and the dependant variable is the alpha amplitudes measured in microvolts (\u03bcV). Materials: Data was collected using a Biopac MP360. EEG electrodes were used, and AC cream was applied to help with the conductivity and reduce impedance. Everi cream to reduce skin impedance. PsychoPy is used to provide the stimuli and an event marker is sent to the Biopac. A large and small bar stimulus (figure 1a and 1b) in which participants focus their attention to. And arrow cues letting the participants know which side the stimulus will appear on, symbolised by the keys &lt; and &gt;. Procedure: The Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35 Hz and channels are set up to allow the left and right cue event markers to be accessed through PsychoPy, the event markers were used to identify when the stimuli were presented. Another channel is set up to record activity from the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz), the sampling rate was 1000 Hz; 1000 observations recorded per second. The experimenter explained the objective to the participant and consent was given before proceeding, electrodes were then put into place. Following the \u20181020 system positioning\u2019 the active electrode is placed on the P3 site on the left side of the parietal lobe in the brain. The reference electrode is placed at Fz and the earth electrode is placed by the participants hairline. Impedance checks are then done and were kept below 10KOhms. Instructions were presented on the screen for the participants to follow, stating that a cue will appear indicating which side the stimulus will appear on; left or right. A fixation cross appeared in the centre then followed by a stimulus of a bar either large or small. Participants were then told to press a specific key depending on which bar was presented e.g., \"L\" for large bar and \"S\" for small bar. Practice trials were completed first to allow them to test run the experiment and understand what they are being asked to do. Participants took part in 4 different conditions with 3 repeats so a total of 12 practice trials. Once completed feedback was given to the participants. Similarly, to the practice trial, participants then took part in the real trial containing 20 blocks of 4 trials in which 50% of the trials cued left and 50% cued right all in a randomised order. In total there was 80 experimental trials. The cues were presented on the screen for 35ms. Then followed by a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) this is set for 200ms to 1200ms. An event marker is then sent at the onset of the stimulus and the stimulus was then displayed for 50ms. Participants then proceed to respond. During the study the experimenters explained to the participant what the task was, they put the electrodes in place and proceeds to the impedance test, then the experimenter begins the experiment for the participant to complete. The experimenter recorded the data which was then followed by debriefing the participant about the aims of the study. The experimenter helped to clean up the participant then proceeded to analyse the data that was recorded. Participants had to read the instructions that appeared before starting the experiment and follow these instructions by pressing certain keys and focusing on what appears on the screen. Data treatment: When the experiment is running, event markers were sent to the computer, then to the biopac. This records exactly when the stimuli were presented, this allows the period 200ms before stimulus onset to be analysed for the Cl and Cr condition. The raw alpha data were then rectified regardless of it being either excitatory or inhibitory. This meant that any negative values were converted to positive values and an average deviation from 0\u03bcV was produced. The data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce extreme values. These data then become rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA). Results: Table 1 shows the results for 38 participants as one participant withdrew from the experiment, so no data is provided. A Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to test whether the data was parametric or non-parametric. As the p value was less than .05, a non-parametric test was carried out. The median RAAA indicates that the Cl condition had higher alpha amplitude compared to the CR condition at the P3 site. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T= 566, n= 38, p= .002). Discussion: The findings support the hypothesis that there is greater alpha amplitude when the stimuli are Cl then when the stimuli are Cr. Our results are consistent with the AIH and Sauseng et al as alpha activity is contralateral to the side it is processed, and our results showed there was less alpha activity contralateral to the stimuli where the visual stimuli had been processed. This suggest that the side of the brain that is not involved with attention has less alpha activity. A methodological problem of this study is that attention could have been redirected due to being in a distracting environment in which multiple other students were talking. Evidence from previous research (Garrison &amp; Williams 2013) shows that participants do not perform as well when distracted and are more likely to make common mistakes when taking part in a task. To gain more accurate results these limitations will need to be controlled such as being in an environment with minimal noises, therefore helping the participant to focus better.", "positive": "hh I will just relaxed Yeahh and I spent all of last night doing my assignments so I can rest now Ooh that\u2019s good Do you then start revision and coursework They really haven\u2019t been nice to you at all Aww well done They acc need to take it easy on you guys Awww Are you staying at home with your mum It\u2019s getting better tbh Not as painful Ooh no worries \ud83d\ude02 How was your day?

{"id": "aug_502", "anchor": "The subjective expected utility theory (Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1944; Savage, 1954) is a theory within decision making which aims to provide a way of optimal decision making. This theory consists of 5 different axioms which assign utility outcomes in a way that it can maximise their expected utility in any decision one makes. These axioms include preferences, transitivity, indifferent, preference and no alternative being infinitely better than other. 1. Preferences being well ordered means that two possible outcomes, (A and B) either A would be preferring to B or B to A, otherwise, the decision maker is known to be indifferent meaning they do not care which one becomes known. 2. Preferences being transitive refers to A being preferred to B, as well as B being preferred over C therefore, A would be preferred to C as well. This way it is in relation. 3. Furthermore, being indifferent between A and B, means that only one has outcome A in such a gamble, however they both hold the same level of probability. 4. Preference. This means that if I like A to B, I will not change my preference even if I am offered a third option (C). 5. Lastly, no alternative being infinitely better than any other. In this case, if one prefers A to B and B to C, there are chances of probabilistic mixture of A to C, as they are indifferent between B and that mixture. From these 5 axioms, 3 principles have been derived via psychological experiments. Transitivity, indifference, and preference. Transitivity does not always hold due to \u2018single mindfulness\u2019 (focusing on a single attribute while excluding other attributes which are important for a decision) therefore A will not necessarily be preferred to C. Furthermore, indifferent has been proved wrong by \u2018framing\u2019 by the Asian-flu problem (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981). People tend to point out the negative losses more. Lastly, Allias paradox (Allais, 1953) proves that invariance does not always uphold as people tend to pick the certain option.", "positive": "d morning , You can contact the following people for my references. -Main referee, Head of sixth form at : -My tutor at : Kind regards, Good morning , That\u2019s fine.

{"id": "aug_504", "anchor": "Over the last few years EMNE\u2019s have become more prominent within the globalised world we now live in. These firms have had a significant boost since 2002; also referred to as the \u2018going global era.\u2019 They tend to come from emerging, upper-middle income economies and developing countries and use a variety of entry modes such as joint ventures, strategic alliances and wholly owned subsidiaries (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). However, the majority choose to expand rapidly into developed countries using M&amp;A\u2019s and are late movers. A growing number of EMNE\u2019s are starting to dominate certain industries such as banking, telecommunications and engineering and outward FDI from emerging countries is increasing. For example, China has increased its presence within the Fortune 500 between 2004 and 2019; whilst the presence of US firms has started to decrease, showing the ever-growing dominance of EMNE\u2019s (Fortune Global 500, 2004,2019). There\u2019s several firms many of us from the western world may not have realised are owned by EMNE\u2019s, such as Tetley being owned by TATA \u2013 an Indian conglomerate; meaning it owns several different types of businesses and McVitie\u2019s being owned by Turkish EMNE, Yildiz Holding. This essay will highlight the key differences between MNE\u2019s and EMNE\u2019s and examine how effective current theories are at explaining outward FDI from emerging country multinationals and compare and contrast them to the more recent theories which have been developed; including the LLL model and Springboard theory. Some academics believe these new EMNE\u2019s have different motivations, which don\u2019t necessarily fit in with the traditional theories; whilst others think that these theories can be applied just as effectively as the newer ones. Key differences between traditional western MNE\u2019s and EMNE\u2019s Only a decade ago many EMNE\u2019s, which are booming today and challenging some of the most established MNE\u2019s in many industries, were marginal competitors. So how have they managed to do this in such a short space of time and be successful? It\u2019s important to look at the key characteristics of both traditional MNE\u2019s and the newer EMNE\u2019s to see what makes them so different. A main difference is the speed they internationalise. Many traditional MNE\u2019s expand gradually, following the Uppsala model whereby they expand into countries which are psychologically close considering factors such as, geography, shared language and shared cultures. On the other hand, EMNE\u2019s expand at a more accelerated pace. They do this to close the gap between their market reach and the global presence of MNE\u2019s from developed countries (Mathews, 2006). A good example of an EMNE which has expanded rapidly is Chinese firm Huawei. In just five years, despite starting as a domestic firm in 2001, it was operating in over 100 countries by 2006. It did this by providing solid technology at low prices and hiring low cost engineers at 20% of western rates. This allowed them to strongly compete against western MNE\u2019s and expand quickly (Fey et al, 2016). EMNE\u2019s also use latecomer advantage whereby they learn from mistakes of MNE\u2019s already established in the market and do better themselves. MNE\u2019s are essentially used as \u2018guinea pigs.\u2019 With regards to ownership advantages many MNE\u2019s have the required resources available to them internally; making this a big advantage if they were to expand into developing countries. However, EMNE\u2019s are sometimes seen as having weak ownership advantages, but many believe this is debatable as their institutional advantages are so strong and they can also just obtain resources and capabilities through M&amp;A\u2019s; which would naturally upgrade their ownership advantages. Institutional advantages are another key element to consider when comparing the firms. It\u2019s well documented that traditional MNE\u2019s have struggled significantly in countries with institutional voids as they\u2019re used to political stability; due to coming from countries with highly stable environments. As a result, they don\u2019t have the same experiences to cope with instability in the same way as EMNE\u2019S. New EMNE\u2019s are known to have this as a big advantage over traditional MNE\u2019s, as they\u2019re used to dealing and complying with discretionary and unstable governments in their domestic countries, therefore meaning they\u2019re better prepared to succeed in foreign countries with weak institutional environments (Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Genc, 2008). It\u2019s also believed that if EMNE\u2019s can successfully thrive in unstable developing countries, they most certainly can be successful in stable, developed countries. Finally, there\u2019s key differences in the organisational adaptability of MNE\u2019s versus EMNE\u2019s. It\u2019s believed that EMNE\u2019s are much more adaptable than MNE\u2019s which tend to suffer from inertia, by being stuck in their ways, as they have deeply ingrained values, cultures and organisational structures (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). Consequently, they tend to have lower success rates with M&amp;A\u2019s due to their lack of adaptability - almost two thirds of acquisitions by western firms end in failure, as the acquirer doesn\u2019t give flexibility to the firm acquired. On the other hand, EMNE\u2019s tend to have a high M&amp;A success rate - 67% success rate, as their adaptability is high, and they appreciate the firm they acquire more; due to their lack of global presence. Existing theories and their relevance Two major theories which explain the existing ways firms expand overseas successfully are Dunning\u2019s Eclectic Paradigm and the Uppsala Model. Dunning uses OLI theory to explain why firms use outward FDI; suggesting the key advantages as being ownership advantages, location advantages and internalisation advantages. Ownership advantages refer to valuable resources and capabilities a firm offers a country it expands into, which gives them a competitive advantage. Many argue that due to their lack of capabilities and resources, coming from developing countries, EMNE\u2019s can\u2019t satisfy this part of the OLI paradigm. Going by Dunning\u2019s explanation this would mean that they\u2019re unable to engage in outward FDI, however many still do and are proven successful. Furthermore, some believe EMNE\u2019s from developing countries could be considered to have ownership disadvantages, as they lack a well-known image and may not have the ability to compete on the same scale as western MNE\u2019s, who have larger finances and advanced technologies (Fey et al, 2016). In addition, location advantages are required by Dunning to expand overseas effectively; this is what host countries can offer to a firm undertaking FDI there (Dunning, 1979). However, many EMNE\u2019s don\u2019t go abroad to access location advantages, such as lower cost production, lower labour costs or cheaper technology; as they already have this available to them in their domestic markets. For example, many Chinese firms won\u2019t outsource their production to a developed country if they\u2019re to expand their firm into them, because it\u2019s well documented that production and labour within China can be done at a much cheaper cost to say that in the US. As both ownership advantages and location advantages aren\u2019t satisfied in the OLI paradigm, it makes it possible to say that the theory could become redundant or less relevant as more EMNE\u2019S become successful in developed markets; without having satisfied all three elements within the paradigm. Secondly, the Uppsala model is another model used to explain the internationalisation of firms. It emphasises how firms go abroad incrementally and increase commitments gradually. This may mean they go into countries close to their domestic market first. A firm may first export to a country, then open an overseas subsidiary and finally build or acquire their own factory abroad as they gain more knowledge about the market and establish their operations. EMNE\u2019S are unfortunately thought to leapfrog some steps outlined above and may even start the internationalisation process by becoming \u2018born global\u2019 and setting up the factory first. According to Eriksson et al (2000), the Uppsala Model is based on the idea that the behaviour of the internationalisation process is path dependent. Path dependence is a process based on the accumulated knowledge from the firm\u2019s past international experience, which directs the firm\u2019s future trajectory (Eriksson et al, 2000). A main concern is that Uppsala explains this path dependence but EMNE\u2019s have no experience in developed countries to use. As a result, they can only use knowledge of developing countries. On the other hand, MNE\u2019s know all about operating in developed markets so are at a bigger advantage. Finally, part of the Uppsala model is the idea of psychic distance - entering countries psychologically close. A main issue with this idea is that EMNE\u2019s may not be able to use psychic distance to enter developed countries because they\u2019re so different in nature. For example, developing countries may have stronger cultural, language, political and legal differences to developed countries. This would also be the case for MNE\u2019s looking to expand into developing countries. The development of new theories As time has progressed new theories have been developed to try to explain and analyse how these new EMNE\u2019s have used outward FDI to expand their presence internationally. The reason for creating these theories is because many couldn\u2019t understand how these firms from countries with weaker country specific advantages could compete against the firms from developed countries. At first glance, it appears these EMNE\u2019s have weaker firm specific advantages compared to their western rivals. The springboard theory was created (Luo and Tung, 2007) to explain why these firms expand so aggressively and the drivers behind this. The theory highlights seven elements. The first being that EMNE\u2019s use their international expansion to compensate for their ownership disadvantages; this means that to counteract the fact they can\u2019t offer a lot initially in terms of resources to the new market, they expand internationally and benefit from other means such as gaining resources from another firm through a M&amp;A. Immediately, this makes the OLI paradigm seem less relevant, as it\u2019s highlighting that they can still be a success without initial ownership advantages. The second element of the theory says that EMNE\u2019s use the international expansion to overcome their latecomer disadvantage; this means that they benefit from being able to see where MNE\u2019s have made mistakes and ensuring they don\u2019t make the same ones. Next, it explains that MNE\u2019s from developing countries use international expansion as a springboard to counter-attack global rivals\u2019 major foothold in their home country market. It also outlines that EMNE\u2019s use outward FDI as a springboard to bypass certain trade barriers, such as quotas and anti-dumping penalties. This means that they go into another developingemerging markets with fewer restrictions. For example, if a Chinese firm were to set up a foreign subsidiary or production in Mexico and then export their good to the US. This again goes against the OLI paradigm as the firm isn\u2019t directly using the location advantages of the US for production in the example above. Instead, they\u2019re choosing to use those of Mexico to then sell in the US. Furthermore, the theory says new emerging MNE\u2019s expand internationally to alleviate domestic institutional constraints. This for example could be if their home country doesn\u2019t have strong patent laws, so they take their product elsewhere to be better protected therefore, benefitting from the county\u2019s location advantage of having stronger patent protection. The final two elements explain that EMNE\u2019s use international expansion to both secure preferential treatment offered by emerging governments and exploit their competitive advantage in other markets. To secure preferential treatment a domestic firm, say an Indian firm, may set up a subsidiary within the UK and then invest back into India to gain the tax benefit and the preferential government treatment. A second new theory developed is the LLL model (Mathews, 2006). This model has similarities to the Springboard theory in the way it explains why EMNE\u2019s expand and internationalise. However, the key takeaway is that it says EMNE\u2019s go abroad and then they learn. This is a massive contrast to the Uppsala model which emphasises the gradual process of expansion and firms using the knowledge they already possess to expand into markets with similarities, that are psychologically close. Firms going abroad and then learning highlights a more aggressive approach to expansion. The three L\u2019s in the model stand for linkage, leverage and learning. The linkage element examines the collaborations between EMNE\u2019s and foreign firms through entry modes such as joint ventures, M&amp;A\u2019s and alliances. Leverage explains that EMNE\u2019s exploit global linkages to become \u2018latecomers\u2019 by harnessing resources and cost advantages to compete globally. The second \u2018L\u2019 really highlights the idea that firms go abroad and then learn from the foreign partners already in the market and demonstrates why Dunning\u2019s theory is less relevant of initially having certain ownership advantages to be successful. Finally, the learning element is the stage where EMNE\u2019s acquire competitive advantages and learn how to compete internationally. Firms don\u2019t need initial advantages necessarily; as they can expand and then learn and therefore become competitive. Overall, this model argues that firms acquire resources and learn over time before internationalisation occurs and the EMNE is integrated into the international activities. Although these theories have been developed and are more tailored to the new types of EMNE\u2019s, they do still have their drawback such as underestimating the importance of absorption capacity and they go against the path dependence theory; as expressed in the Uppsala model. Finally, it\u2019s clear that the importance of ownership advantages is dismissed; which is a key element in the existing OLI paradigm. In summary, it\u2019s evident EMNE\u2019s and traditional MNE\u2019s differ both in the way they operate and the way they internationalise. Key differences include the speed EMNE\u2019s internationalise compared with MNE\u2019s and how differently they use or even don\u2019t use their initial ownership advantages to ensure success abroad. Although they have their differences, both types of firm have proven to be successful in their own ways. However, there\u2019s still a huge question mark over how these newer EMNE\u2019s have prevailed so much globally. Thus, newer theories have been developed to try and explain this dominance. It must be said that although these new theories more accurately explain the rapid growth of EMNE\u2019s and why having ownership advantages isn\u2019t as essential as some older theories may suggest; they do still have their criticisms, as explained above. Consequently, further theories may have to be developed which are more accurate and less open to scrutiny. However, it really depends on individual views as to which theories are considered more relevant. Some would argue Dunning and the Uppsala model have been used for many years and can still be used effectively today, whilst others may say the world is constantly changing, as seen with the recent rise of EMNE\u2019s, and therefore it\u2019s necessary to keep developing and updating new theories. This will make them most effective and relevant to the current situations firms and countries find themselves in. For example, Carl Fey and others developed a new 5M framework which guides academics in their understanding of the internationalisation of EMNE\u2019s (Fey et al, 2009). It proved that internationalisation is challenging for any firm. The largest challenge for EMNE\u2019s, which is not always covered by the older theories, is overcoming the problem of a negative country image (Y.Y. Chang et al., 2009; E.Chang &amp; Taylor., 1999; Ferner et al., 2005; Smith &amp; Meiksins, 1995). It\u2019s the job of newer theories to potentially provide insight into how EMNE\u2019\u2019s can overcome this challenge.", "positive": ", Would it be possible to upload the lecture slides for our lecture later today to so I can print them off to make notes during the webinar? \ud83d\ude42 Many thanks, Hi , This is just a quick email to ask if we will be going over anything regarding the coursework again during our lesson on ?

{"id": "aug_514", "anchor": "This essay shall address the question \"What are the core assumptions and key features of the biological and psychoanalytical perspectives in psychology? In what ways are they similar and how do they differ?\". Each approach has their own individual assumptions and features, some of which are strengths and some of which are weaknesses, but each perspective has its place in psychological science as they can both be used in suitable situations, with the Biological approach being a more scientific, research based, utilitarian perspective, and the Psychoanalytical approach being a more theoretical, subjective, purity focused perspective towards psychology (Singh, 1991). One core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many of our adult behavior and feelings stem from childhood experiences. An example of this is Freud\u2019s theory of the Psychosexual developmental stages, a key feature of the Psychodynamic approach. This theory is characterized by the five stages of childhood development; these are the Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latent, and Genital stages (Brown, 1964). According to Psychodynamic theory, each of these stages must be successfully completed in order for the individual to progress, and failure to complete any particular stage will result in fixation. Fixation refers to the id\u2019s inability to transfer its pleasure-seeking focus from one psychosexual stage to the next. Without this natural progression, fixation will be shown in the behavior and feelings of the individual (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), for example someone with an oral fixation may take up smoking or start biting the nails, as they find pleasure in these oral-related activities. At this point, the Psychodynamic approach delves into the Biological side of psychology in a key feature referred to as \u2018Psychosomatic\u2019 disorders. This is the idea that unconscious psychological factors can produce physical manifestations, often seen as a disease or symptom, and that these disorders can be treated or cured by resolving the internal psychological cause, be it past trauma or a psychosexual fixation (Freud &amp; Riviere, 1961). This core assumption covers the \u2018nurture\u2019 side of the nature nurture debate as fixation tends to be the result of the way the child is raised, however the very presence of the psychosexual stages in everyone relates to the nature side of the debate. Another core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach is \u2018Psychic determinism\u2019. This is the theory that all behavior is caused by mental processes. This idea of all behavior having a psychological cause is shown in the psychodynamic theory of structure of personality. This structure is made up of three parts, the Id, Ego, and Superego, with the Id being the driving force behind our pleasure seeking behavior, the Superego counteracting the Id with the morality of our desires, and the Ego balancing the two to comply with the rules of society and reality (Freud &amp; Rickman, A General Selection from the Works of Sigmund Freud, 1953). Freud\u2019s theory of personality structure addresses the determinism versus free will dichotomy as, if all behavior is dictated by the interactions between the three structures, then the individual has no freedom in their actions. One last core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many feelings and behaviors are driven by unconscious forces. This is seen in Freud\u2019s theory of the Unconscious, which is in turn related to the theory of personality structure. The theory of the Unconscious separates the mind into three levels of consciousness; There is the Conscious which is our fully accessible thought, and then there is the Preconscious which can be accessed using psychodynamic techniques and the Unconscious which cannot be accessed, both of which operate in the subconscious level of thought (Freud &amp; Strachey, On Metapsychology: The Theory of Psychoanalysis, 1984). These are further related to the theory of personality structure as the different structures are located in different levels of consciousness. The Id operates solely in the Unconscious mind, the Ego exists mainly in the Conscious mind, and the Superego spans across all three levels of consciousness (Costigan, 1967). This interaction between the levels of consciousness is an example of the Psychodynamic approach\u2019s stance on the Idiographic versus Nomothetic debate, as the unconscious drives that affect behavior are generalized to humanity as a whole rather than individuals being affected by different unconscious forces or having differing levels of consciousness. A core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is that for psychology to be considered a valid science rather than a pseudoscience, then it must be treated as a science. In order for this to happen the scientific method must be upheld as it would be in any other scientific field of study, including using correct experimental methods such as Laboratory, Field, Natural, and Quasi experiments (Beatty, 2001). These are used to test hypotheses, the data from which is then peer reviewed. This core assumption relies on the Determinism argument rather than free will; For causational relationships between variables to be identified, particularly in regard to behavior, the assumption must be made that there is a cause at all (Green, 1987). In this case, the Biological is similar to the Psychodynamic approach. Another core assumption of the Biological approach, and perhaps the most important assumption in this approach, is the idea that many if not all behavioral characteristics are due to internal biological processes. This can include hormones, neuronal activity, and the genetic make up of an individual, as well as externally caused internal reactions such as brain damage (Kolb &amp; Whishaw, 2008). One way psychologists can study biological causes of behavior is through direct observation as the phenomena occur. Methods of this include brain scans such as MRI, ECG and EEG, and less brain-focused methods such as blood tests (Kalat, 2017). However, these methods can be quite invasive and are not always valid methods of measuring the inner-most structures of the brain. To address this issue, post-mortem studies are conducted (Groves &amp; Rebec, 1992). This is a key feature of the Biological approach where the brains of individuals, often with abnormal brain processes, are studied after death to observe the physical structure of these brains. As biological processes often take place on a scale too small to directly observe, biological psychologists often must resort to making inferences based on observable data, another key feature of the approach. A final core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is the idea of the evolutionary explanation for certain behaviors. The Darwinian theory of evolution features heavily in biological psychology, as some behaviors seem to be instinctual from birth. For example, particular phobias can be observed in young children even though the participants have never had any contact with the phobic stimulus before. \u2018Ophidiophobia\u2019 is an abnormal fear of snakes, and can be seen in children who have never before had any experience with snakes (Fredrikson, Annas, Fischer, &amp; Vik, 1996). The evolutionary explanation would suggest that this fear is instinctual and has been inherited as a survival mechanism to ensure the continuation of the individual\u2019s genes (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). This core assumption is an example of the nomotheticism of the Biological approach, as the theory of heredity of behavior is generalized to the entirety of humanity, as well as other species. The Biological and the Psychodynamic approaches both have weaknesses, some shared between the two approaches, some differing. Whilst Biopsychology takes a wider idiographic approach to behavior which can be considered to be overly simplistic and excessively generalized, the Psychodynamic approach uses an individual\u2019s childhood experiences to explain behavior, an idiographic method which may be considered to be too subjective to qualify as anything more than pseudoscience. The Biological approach uses the strictly monitored scientific method to prove hypotheses, using empirical data to demonstrate causational relationships between biological processes and behavioral phenomena (Breedlove &amp; Watson, 2013), whereas elements of the Psychodynamic approach uses methods that are dependent on the subjective interpretations of the psychologist using them, for example dream analysis (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), making it difficult to form concrete theories about certain behaviors. However, some assumptions of the two approaches can be seen as strengths of the different schools of thought. For example, the quantification of data used in many areas of Biopsychological research enables the results to be carefully and extensively analyzed to find correlations between variables and behavioral traits, and often lead to identifying causational relationships for feelings and behavior. The Psychodynamic approach uses more qualitative research which can be useful when producing Psychoanalytical treatments for individual patients. Also, the Biological approach takes a more utilitarian view towards psychology as a science. This means that the research conducted by Biological psychologists is focused around the practical uses of the results. It could be argued that this is partly due to the high financial cost of biological research, which requires grants and funding from organizations that would benefit from the results. The Psychodynamic approach has a more psychological purity point of view when it comes to research, meaning that some of the research and theories are produced purely for the philosophical understanding of behavior (Clark, 1980). For example, it could be argued that the theory of personality structure has very limited practical use as the Id, Ego and Superego cannot be directly interfered with, even though it is a possible explanation to help psychologists understand behavior. To conclude, both the Biological and the Psychoanalytic have some similar key features and core assumptions, and others that differ between the two. Each perspective has its own strengths and weaknesses and their own practical applications. Inevitably there will always be individuals who strongly disagree with one or the other, but given the chance each approach has something to offer modern view of psychology.", "positive": "r , Please could you confirm this can be done?

{"id": "aug_517", "anchor": "Introduction The topic of research I decided to study is why it\u2019s mostly students who take Humanities and social sciences degrees; specifically, Psychology students, who are interested in East Asian cultures such as Korean culture. This is an interesting topic to explore because me personally and people around me, have experience of studying Psychology and being a part of Korean society and the Japanese and Manga Society at Aston university. Most of the members of Korean society are Psychology undergraduates so I found that quite interesting and wanted to see if there was an actual link between these types of university students and an interest in East Asian culture as many of them join related societies such as the ones mentioned previously or martial arts societies from these specific cultures to develop their interests or to find new hobbies and interests out of curiosity. My main research question is \u2018What Psychology students\u2019 experiences are in being interested in Korean culture?\u2019 I decided this would be an Interpretative phenomenological study as it focuses on student\u2019s personal experiences and reasonings behind why they chose to study Psychology and why and how they became interested in Korean culture. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) focuses on \"wanting to understand the meaning of human experience\" this suggests that the method is focused on trying to understand and make sense of how people make sense of their experiences. IPA is also an idiographic form of research method as it is \"conducted at the level of the individual case\" so you\u2019re able to \"make specific claims about the individuals studied\" (Sullivan, C. &amp; Forrester, M.,2019). This means that it is more person orientated and allows researchers to look at certain niche groups and create specialised generalisations on specific typesgroups of people. Therefore, I felt like it was a method that was most suited to this topic as the group of people I am studying are quite specific. I approached the analysis by highlighting points of interest whilst transcribing the audio of my semi-structured interview. After completing the transcription, I went through my highlighted areas and did descriptive summaries on them. I then tried to group the coding to come up with relevant theories and see if anything was contradictory or could be explained further. Analysis The key themes I will be discussing in this analysis are relatability and self-discovery, as they constantly came up throughout the interview which allowed me to group multiple parts of discussion into these two themes. Relatability I chose relatability as one of the themes because during the interview, my participant Faith (Fake name) mentioned a lot of situations where she felt she could relate to them through her personal experiences. Faith mentioned that true crime, especially rape cases was one of the reasons she became interested in Psychology as it touched her. Being South African, Faith felt like she could relate to the issue of citizens going through the constant threat of gender-based violence against women. A study conducted found that gender inequality was part of the reason why women were more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner or contract HIVAIDS from them. The researchers found and concluded that women with violent and controlling male partners (abusive) were more likely to contract the viruses as those men would force their partners to take part in risky sexual practices (Dunkle et al, 2004). Faith mentioned that prostitution was also illegal in South Africa and again, due to the gender disparities, female sex workers are criminalised, and systems aren\u2019t set in place to protect them from harm. Faith wants to \"help in positive change, treating people like people instead of (.) dehumanising like. [they\u2019ve been though a lot]\". This further supports the claim that sex workers are not treated fairly and due to their nature of work and even based on just their gender, are not protected but even blamed. Faith feels that Korean culture is respectful, and group orientated, she states that \"with the whole South Korean culture like they are all like respectful to each other it\u2019s a culturist culturistic culture so like I really enjoy that\". From this we can infer that Faith is drawn to the group orientated mindset, however, I am assuming that when she means \u2018culturistic\u2019 she meant collectivist, I did check it by her to be sure. She feels like South Korean social culture is like South African culture in terms of mutual respect for the people around you and the collectivism shown amongst people, she mentions that \"I love working together\" and \"in South Africa you know your neighbours, you know everyone, here you don\u2019t [know your neighbours] you don\u2019t know your flatmates\" this suggests that she can relate to Korean culture more than Western culture as they share similar cross-cultural values that she understands, thus supporting the effect of relatability on her interest in South Korean culture. Self-discovery I chose self-discovery as another theme because whilst talking to Faith, I was able to find out that she felt personal connections to some experiences she discussed and felt that they brought out or revitalised parts of her interests or personalities that were previously doormat or overshadowed. Faith stated that Psychology was her favourite subject during sixth form, and it was the only one she found interesting during A levels \"A levels was like the worst two years of my life\" this suggests that A levels was not an enjoyable time for Faith and further shows how Psychology could have been her favourite subject. She also highlights how her Psychology teacher during that time was really kind and helpful to her \"he helped me like prepare everything to do for uni\" she says now, she does not regret her decision to study Psychology at University all these things combined may have influenced the positive feelings she started to have when first learning Psychology which has led her to pursue it at a higher level. Faith finds that she is learning more about herself through Psychology even though she believes that \"Psychology involves learning about others\" this suggests that Psychology allows for the personal development of students who study it and gives a chance for them to open their minds and find out about other things that may interest them. Within the theme of self-discovery, as Faith became more interested in Korean culture, she also became interested in Korean skin care \"South Korea has the best skin care\" this just coincides with the common sentiment of Korean skincare. The country is known worldwide as the plastic surgery capital and for its dermatological research and highly popularised cosmetic culture which includes skin-care routines, this has led to the sale of high quality, mostly affordable products targeted for the skin on the global market (find research stats &amp; qoute). Due to the increased interest in Korean culture, this has also increased accessibility to these things and many media outlets such as Korean music and media, this as a whole, is known as the \u2018Hallyu wave\u2019. Faith also expresses her interests in music and media, specifically K-pop, she expressed that she really enjoyed dancing to K-pop groups songs as she was not able to during secondary school, Korean culture \"has brought back like dancing part of me back\" this suggests that exploring the culture further has allowed her to pursue her interests again. Faith has also taken an interest in Korean food and feels like the country\u2019s cooking practices have entered her cooking style \"like now I\u2019m starting to cook with like Soy sauce [and all these things]\" this shows how influenced Faith has become by Korean culture and how its seamlessly interwoven into her life. She states that \"everything I do now just leads me to them\", the \u2018them\u2019 being the main interest points of Korean culture for her e.g., dance and cooking. Faith also found interest in Korean dramas and movies due to recommendations from friends but was already interested in other foreign shows \"(.) I just got bored of watching Western stuff\" this suggests Faith\u2019s willingness to consume media and entertainment different to watch she usually consumes, indicating an open, which was one of the reasons I expressed for the connection of Psychology students and their interest in Korean culture as Psychology students usually cultivate an open mind during their degrees. Through this analysis of the themes, I have been able to conclude that there is a link between Psychology students\u2019 experiences with interests in Korean culture whilst focusing on Faith and what her experiences are. The link is related to the benefits of open mindedness which allows you to find new interests pr develop old ones that you previously had, especially open mindedness to cultures different or similar to your own but in another societal setting.", "positive": "Dear CEO, These are what I was able to find with the list you have given me: I found a central hotel called Radisson Blu seaside hotel, which costs \u00a391 per night and \u00a3181 for 2 nights which satisfies your budget conditions of \u00a3200 and location conditions of being close to water.

Firstly, I have found a hotel called the Radisson Blue seaside hotel as i know you like the water and would want to be near it, this hotel is only 1 mile away from the Hetrikani beach and has stunning ocean views from the room. it is \u00c2\u00a377 a night within your budget and has many features such as AC, barlounge, a gym in case you would want to blow off any steam from the conference. It has many positive reviews and is deemed one of the best in Helsinki! It also is near many great sights so travelling will be very convenient. It is 6 mins from a museum as well as 2 mins from a escape room in case you would want to partake any other activities during your trip. The cafe I found for you to have breakfast at is called Eckberg cafe and is only a 12 min walk away from the hotel and they have many positive reviews and the images of the food also look amazing! The national museum of Finland are home to many artefacts and feature a great deal of history which will be perfect for you to get to know the history of the place and is only a 20 minute metro journey from the hotel, with the metro also near the hotel, perfect for travelling there! In terms of the restaurant, I found the restaurant Olo for you, it has a unique ambience with amazing food and are cautious with dietary requirements as I know you are allergic to shellfish. This restaurant is also close by to the hotel being 19 mins away! The lioporo gift shop is also home to some amazing handmade souvenir and typical souvenirs so you can get authentic gifts for your children, and again this is all close by so you don't have to worry about not having time due to your busy schedule! Finally, I know you wanted a nice live music venue to wind down in the evenings and I have found the Tavasata which is the no.1 live music venue in Helsinki and is described as legendary and iconic and is only 6 mins away!

{"id": "aug_524", "anchor": "The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport\u2019s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA\u2019s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims. Corruption is defined as \u2018dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority\u2019. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the \u2018spirit of sport\u2019 which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example. Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so. It is very possible that chalking Armstrong\u2019s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA? Clean athletes often lose out The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures \u2018clean athletes don\u2019t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments\u2019. Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping. Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete\u2019s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA\u2019s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete\u2019s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS\u2019 shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was \u2018\u2026 the most detrimental aspect of the Code\u2019. One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies. There is not a \u2018level playing field\u2019 It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in \u2018sophisticated doping\u2019 in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are \u2018unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated\u2019. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists. Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya\u2019s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success. It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean. WADA cannot enforce consequences 'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that \u2018at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach\u2019. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country. The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was \u2018a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.\u2019 For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies\u2019 ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to. Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being \u2018neutral athletes\u2019 provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. Legalising doping is flawed It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations. While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious. It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change. Conclusion It has been argued that WADA\u2019s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", "positive": "lo, asked if it was a possibility.

{"id": "aug_528", "anchor": "Johns Case: John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010). Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: John\u2019s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John\u2019s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992). Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so. John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017). As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008), who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008). John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood. Coping: John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance. In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). Interventions: The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and has little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007). Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": "when ave gon non family weddings i wear suits?

{"id": "aug_529", "anchor": "This strategy paper will focus on suggesting realistic solutions to the problem of educational gender inequality in India. This inequality is a clear problem; unequal access to education is an infringement of human rights. If this gender disparity was lessened, the well-being and development of children would be positively impacted, as well as the economy of the country itself (Fuller, 2019). To tackle this issue, proposed strategies could take the form of implementing new legislative reforms that aid families in the struggles they face, as well as reforming teaching throughout India in order to help eradicate damaging cultural and social norms. The paper will begin by firstly explaining the main problems within the education sector in India and will then highlight the importance of achieving gender equality in education. The main body of the paper will entail a detailed analysis of the current strategies and legislation in place as well as non-governmental reforms made by different organisations. The paper will then move towards a focus on the suggested strategies that could be incorporated into the current education system to alleviate gender inequalities and will be compared to the successes of educational reform in Sweden. This will include a description of the targets for the reforms, instruments to aid reform, and the target groups at which reforms are aimed at. The paper will conclude with a summary of the findings from this research and ways to ensure the successful implementation of new strategies. Why is this a problem? There are two primary factors that can limit the education of girls in India: cultural traditions and poverty. In terms of cultural traditions, there are several reasons that this issue can play a significant role in the educational disparity between genders. Firstly, the miseducation of parents about the importance of schools for girls and the costings of education itself thus leads to families becoming reluctant to educate girls within the household. Research shows that parents are more willing to send their girls to school if they had access to more information about school (Maertens, 2011). Furthermore, it is said that gender discrimination within household expenditure and education has resulted in the inadequate progress of educating of women in many countries across the world, and thus ingrains this issue into the societal framework of such countries (Saha, 2013). This is also reinforced by the low literacy rates in India. The correlation between low literacy rates among men and women indicates that the miseducation of parents can affect the education of girls because they themselves have had inadequate education, and it is difficult for them to understand the importance of it, further highlighting the gender inequalities between men and women through previous social norms. For example, the 2011 literacy rates of women were 57.93% compared to men which were 77.15% (Pathania, 2020) demonstrating gender disparities and how poverty can be a factor in gender inequalities within education. Poverty plays an important role in the lack of education for girls. Daughters from families that face social pressures to get married are more likely to only complete minimum education, as shown in a study of three rural villages in India, where only 39% of girls were allowed by their parents to pursue higher education, compared to the 71% of boys who would go into further education (Maertens, 2013). Furthermore, educating women is not prioritised in the household as it stops the income that would otherwise be earned from girls going straight into work rather than staying in school. Therefore, working and earning can be seen to be put on a pedestal instead for the many families facing financial difficulties (Hebert, 2020). Why is this an important issue for gender equality? As UNICEF has stated, the educational advancement of girls is the most effective way of combatting challenges to human development, so it is important to expand educational access and overcome cultural norms to achieve this (Ross, Shah &amp; Wang, 2011). Inequalities within education are important to the issue of gender equality, as even though India emerges as one of the top three countries for higher education (Bazaz &amp; Akram, 2020), in certain states such as Uttar Pradesh, only 33.20% of women are educated compared to the 73.40% of men who are educated, highlighting that there are severe problems within the education system that disadvantage women. Furthermore, this can lead to other problems such as a gender gap in the labour market, as if employers value a woman\u2019s education less than that of a man\u2019s, and therefore there are fewer economic incentives to educate women, which subsequently affects the economy and the wellbeing of women (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Another factor that makes this issue important is that the education of girls further reduces the risks they face, such as abuse and child marriage, as currently, a third of child brides worldwide are in India (Sahni, 2018). Moreover, better education for girls reduces the risks of child labour in poorer families to ensure the survival of their households, as the hourly wages of a child with higher school education are 8.97% higher compared to a child with no schooling, leading to less exploitation (Chamarbagwala, 2008). Attempted strategies to achieve gender equality in education There have been many attempts in India to close the gender gaps in education, through both legal and social means. The main legislative reform introduced was the Right to Education Act in 2009, in which, all children between 6 and 14 years of age are required to complete primary school education. This reform has proven successful as enrolment between 2013-14 increased from 43.8% to 48.2% (Sahni, 2018). However, its success still proves limited on the gender equality front as a UNESCO report detailed that of the 95% of children who attended primary school, only 40% continued onto secondary education, in which, a small fraction of the 40% were girls (Modi, 2017). Attempts have also been made to reform the curriculum. However, this failed due to the response of disadvantaged schools towards the issue of gender equality: an attempt was made to create a new system where boys of different abilities were paired with girls, but this meant the educational interests of girls were sacrificed, therefore showing little to no development in changing gender inequalities in schools (Charlton, 2007). Secondly, a non-legislative reform that was made to combat gender inequality in education was the KGBV programme introduced in 2004. The goal of the programme was to increase children\u2019s, and in particular girls, access to the curriculum and to improve teaching standards. This began successfully as two Indian states partnered with CARE India (a non-governmental organisation) to introduce KGBV schools that were single-sex and employ a non-traditional curriculum. The KGBV school initiative was shown to be successful as they were more inclusive than state schools, as children of all castes could attend, which also allowed the new schools challenged harmful social norms. However, the success was limited as the KGBV programme did not focus on education above seventh grade where school dropout rates for girls are the highest (Shah, 2015). Finally, the most successful attempt at improving gender inequality in education was by ANK, a non-profit organisation with an aim to empower girls. ANK set up in 10 rural villages and introduced several initiatives for girls including: bicycle banks in 2002 to improve access to schools for girls, a life skills education programme out of school hours, a scholarship programme, and a karate programme. The implementation of these programmes showed great promise as 1,100 girls achieved a scholarship and 1,000 girls were given access to bikes. It was found that the combination of the bicycle bank and the life skills education programme led to the best education outcomes for girls. However, the bicycle bank programme was discontinued and this programme only reached a small number of girls, so, nationally, gender disparities remained high (Modi, 2017). Proposed Strategies My first proposed strategy is to subsidise costs for school by 50% for low-income families; as mentioned above, many parents selectively choose their male children to attend school rather than their female children, because of financial difficulties. Therefore, subsidising the costs of schooling can enable equal opportunities for girls. This has proved successful in countries such as Sweden, where pre-schooling costs have been subsidised for lower-income families, in order to equalise opportunities for all and ensure substantial educational attainment for both males and females (Bjorklund, Clark, Edin, Fredricksson &amp; Krueger, 2006). Success can be seen clearly when compared to India, a large 79% of the students go on to secondary school in Sweden (European Commission, 2017) against a mere 40% in India, in which, the ratio of boys to girls is equal in Sweden unlike in India (Modi, 2017). Additionally, another legislative reform that could be introduced is to improve families\u2019 access to daycare and after school care, so that parents can work, alleviating any stresses on children providing additional household income. A similar policy proved successful in Sweden (Sweden, 2020), in which a right to daycare was introduced in the 1990s for working parents to alleviate financial pressure (Fritzell, Hvinden, Kautto, Kvist &amp; Uusitalo, 2001). Furthermore, there has been evidence to suggest that altering the way teachers are trained helps to promote gender equality and eradicate bias in the classroom. In a proposed system called REFLECT, teachers are given criteria that they must meet, including creating a suitable learning environment for female and male children - this could prove beneficial in India (Kollmayer, 2020). The next proposed strategy is an extension of the work of ANK with the bicycle banks and life skills education programme (Modi, 2017) as it proved successful but stopped due to a lack of funding. This would enable a focus on the education of girls and give them access to adequate teaching, which in turn reaps enormous benefits economically, socially, and mentally, especially in terms of the wellbeing of girls in India. It would also help to elevate the goal of India to become more gender-inclusive, as currently, their progress for gender equality remains slow and they stand at a ranking of 132 out of 187 countries (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Sequentially, to enable parents of girls to realise the importance of education, it is vital to recruit them as allies in the movement against gender inequalities in education. To do this, parents\u2019 evenings could be introduced for teachers to educate parents in schooling and other matters that put girls at risk such as child marriage. Research shows that parents evenings are important in the development of a child and important for the parents themselves as they are responsible for making key decisions that impact the future of their children (Fefer, 2020), highlighting how this can also be a way to communicate the positive prospects for girls with the aid of education. To conclude, it is prevalent that actions must be taken within education legislation and within the households of girls to combat the problem of gender inequality within education. The government must take steps to support families of lower incomes so as to ensure no one is denied equal opportunity to education. This will reduce child labour rates, increase literacy rates, and improve India\u2019s ranking on the gender equality index, as well as increasing the economic status of many civilians in India. With the increased education of girls, it will help to combat harmful social norms in the future, preventing young girls from the fate of child marriage, abuse, and exploitation. With reforms in teaching, they could allow for long-lasting changes within education, as it means they can be the main drivers for change within schools. This, combined with the added aid of regular parents\u2019 evenings, allows for teachers to become catalysts in changing negative social attitudes towards gender equality concerns that strategies like these will remain only partially effective. For example, India was one of 52 countries that refused to comply with Article 5 of the UN sustainable development goals which states that \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" (United Nations, 2020). Without the support of the government, gender equality may not be valued. However, this can be counteracted by the implementation and enforcement of new laws, starting within the education sector, to allow women and young girls to become more independent and assert themselves within society.", "positive": "\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f will let you know tmrw!!! xxxx thanks love will let them know xxxx Ahhh okay that sounds good!!!

{"id": "aug_532", "anchor": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that is widely identified as having impairments on communication and behaviour. The DSM-V refers to social-emotional reciprocity deficits, difficulties in maintaining relationships and deficits in non-verbal communication as diagnostic criteria for Autism (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Memory functions are another aspect of autism that are talked about frequently, in particular, with executive functions (EF). Studies have shown that autistic individuals (AI) struggle with EF. For example, Bennetto et al. (1996) compared AI to individuals that suffer from frontal lobe brain lesions (extensively known for memory impairments) and found that they scored similarly on standardised EF tasks, showing an impairment on their executive functioning. It is important to note that this study was conducted with high-functioning AI so may not speak for all on the spectrum, nevertheless it has been a prominent study in the field of memory and AI. Regarding gathering evidence from autistic witnesses (AW), a few studies have looked at their performance on line-ups, but a lot of the research has focused on formal interviews. The Cognitive interview (CI) is an interview method that significantly improves the detail and accuracy of witness reports across various witness groups and is used highly in the US and UK (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). However, research by Maras and Bowler (2010) found that when conducting the CI on AI, they were less accurate on all sections of the CI compared to the control of typically developing (TD) matched adults. Further study results also suggest that it isn\u2019t an efficient method of interviewing AW, therefore I will list out a few recommendations that may improve evidence gathering from AW in an interview setting. One key aspect in conducting the CI or other enhanced interviews is the \u2018context reinstatement\u2019. Fisher and Geiselman (1992) stated that context reinstatement requires witnesses to mentally return to the incidentcrime for access to the cues that are representative of the incident context. However, for AW and AI this does not seem boost accuracy or recall but in fact reduce their accuracy and lead to reporting more incorrect details (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). One explanation for this is that AI struggle with episodic memory and the relational binding of events. Bowler et al. (2014) presented this as they conducted a study with autistic participants and TD participants where they viewed coloured drawings in a grid. In one condition, they were asked to recall either the item, colour, or location of the drawing and in the other condition, they were asked to recall the item and colour or the item and location. Results showed that participants with autism did significantly worse in the second condition on both trials. The findings suggest that AI show diminished relational binding compared to TD individuals. However, Solomon et al. (2016) suggested it may not be a relational binding problem but rather the excess use of cognitive functions. Solomon\u2019s study into memory involved autistic adolescents compared to Bowler\u2019s adults which could suggest age-specific differences regarding relational binding. Maras et al (2014) argued that the self-administered interview (SAI) combated the caveats for context reinstatement and the social aspect of the CI. The SAI was developed by Gabbert et al. (2009) to initially preserve the memory of the incidentcrime soon after it occurs. Maras et al. used the SAI with AW and despite the perceived benefits, it did not increase the rate of correct details recalled. However, one aspect of the SAI that they found to be useful was the Sketch component as autistic participants found it easier to recall more details with drawing in relation to the event. Maras et al. suggested that this aspect of the SAI may reduce the cognitive demands on AI. To further support this, Mattison et al. (2015) conducted studies with the sketch reinstatement of context (Sketch-RC) and mental context reinstatement (MCR) on autistic children and TD children and found that autistic children in the Sketch-RC condition (which consisted of drawing everything they could remember from the earlier video they watched) did significantly better than the autistic children in the MRC condition. In this study by Mattison et al. the results only supported free recall so a further study (Mattison et al., 2018) assessed the same conditions also in a probed setting (cued recall) but found that autistic children still did not have higher accuracy or detail but they did make significantly fewer errors than autistic children in the MRC condition. Therefore, to aid AI and AW in investigative interviews, the results from these studies suggest that it may be worth adding a sketch element to interviews, especially with children, as though it may not make the largest difference in detailed recall, it can reduce the amount of errors made, leading to better information gathered for the police. One recent recommendation that is also based off improving the recall of AW is the Witness-aimed First Account (WAFA). The WAFA (Maras et al., 2020) is another method of alternate interviewing where AW self-direct their recall. They stated that while Sketch-RC and the CI use unbounded narrative recall, the WAFA uses segmentation.. During the WAFA study, both autistic and TD participants watched an intact narrative version and narratively scrambled version of a crime video in a WAFA and control interview condition. WAFA condition participants were asked to segment aspects of their recall through questions such as, what the most important part of the video was, or what else had happened. The interviewer then returned to the noted segments and asked the participant to recall what had happened for each segment mentioned, in the same order they mentioned them in. Maras et al. found that autistic participants recalled around 15% more correct information as well as TD participants compared to the control condition. However, autistic participants still recalled less than TD participants with the WAFA which leads to more uncertainty of why AW still can\u2019t do as well as TD individuals. Also, in the present study, the time between watching the two videos and conducting the interview was 30 minutes which is unrealistic in a real-life setting. A longer wait may reduce the \u2018effects\u2019 of the WAFA, as memory worsens over time or it could also surprisingly prove beneficial. Nevertheless, there is supporting evidence for the segmentation method that the WAFA uses. Zacks and Swallow (2007) talked about segmentation and suggest that the way in which individuals segment events can aid to remembering more and learning better, especially if their events have boundaries. Interestingly, a study into AI and perceiving actions by Zalla et al. (2013) found that among individuals that had to detect boundary transitions in events at \u2018fine and coarse\u2019 levels, autistic participants showed reduced accuracy compared to TD participants. These findings support the notion that AI struggle with detecting event boundaries in a traditional sense, which makes it more difficult to provide detail and accuracy in standard or CI. The WAFA appears as a good recommendation as though it requires further research (one of the first studies), it uses framework like Zacks et al. to try and use segmentation for aiding better recall in AI. A further component mentioned earlier, is the social aspect of interviews with AW. Again, it is explicit knowledge that AI have many social communicative deficits (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and one qualitative study conducted by Benford and Standen (2009) looked into how high-functioning AI and individuals with Asperger\u2019s preferred internet communication (IC). Participants in the study spoke about the idea of control with IC, such as control over time and how much time they spent on thinking. One participant mentioned that IC allowed her to not have to deal with the \u2018incomprehension and frustration\u2019 of a social encounter. The study does specifically involve high-functioning AI which again, may not be applicable to a wider autistic population, however the study acquired a large amount of detailed information as participants sent from 22-82 email postings back and the researchers were able to spend a while developing their conclusions. Although this study doesn\u2019t directly relate to witness interviews, the premises of it and other research into remote interviewing (see Nash et al., 2014) suggest that the use of technology in gathering evidence may add an element of comfortability for interviews, which can strengthen rapport and lead to a better investigation as a whole. This is shown as Collins et al. (2002) found among conditions of \u2018rapport\u2019, \u2018neutral\u2019 and \u2018abrupt\u2019 interviews, participants recalled more correct information in the \u2018rapport\u2019 condition without an increase of incorrect information but were also more willing to co-operate and \u2018try harder\u2019 for the interview. One very important factor in these recommendations is that individually, they may not seem to produce extremely yielding results but with more research, it can become clearer which aspects provide better information (such as the sketch aspect in the SAI) or even whether some techniques will work cohesively or not. To conclude, the first two recommendations aim to improve the recall provided by AW and both draw on the Task Hypothesis (Bowler et al., 2004) which suggests that AI have better recall when they are provided with more support on what they want to remember. However, autism is a spectrum disorder, indicating that individuals can be extremely diverse, much research into autism even shows the difference as majority of it looks in to high-functioning AI. Even so, the studies allow for base recommendations that can improve with more research. The last recommendation of using technology to better conduct interviews also requires more research in the field but can no doubt offer a more suitable approach for AW that struggle with the social component of interviews.", "positive": ", These are the interview questions I thought of, I've also highlighted the ones that I think are important.

{"id": "aug_534", "anchor": "Introduction After winning a costa first novel award, The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer (2013) became a piece of popular fiction, inviting a broad range of readers. However, it\u2019s brutal depiction of mental illness means there are differing responses to the text. \u2018Reader response data\u2019 has become a popular way for researchers to identify how a reader places themselves in relation to a text through assessing their responses to said text. This study will assess how reviews from the open access website \u2018Good Reads\u2019 align themselves to The Shock of the Fall\u2019s protagonist and overall narrative. Oatley\u2019s (1999) theory of \"identification\" or \"observer\" will be drawn upon for this purpose, as well as Stockwell\u2019s (2009) discussion of reading metaphors, so that commonalities can emerge to determine factors that cause alignment with the text. To compliment these theories, language analysis more generally will be utilised in order to collectively lead to an understanding of reader positioning within the data sets. Literature Review The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer is a piece of experimental fiction portraying the deteriorating mind of the protagonist, Matthew. McCarthy-Jones (2018) praises Filer for his \"beautiful\" form and word choice, whilst Armstrong (2014, 173) highlights the brilliant use of \"complex narrative structure\" and experimental use of \"graphics and fonts\". Moreover, Armstrong argues that the novel is brilliant both in its insightful portrayal of the family bond, but also in its depictions of mental health. Similarly, Rajasingam (2014) believes the novel depicts the inpatient experience with such accuracy that it could be beneficial for junior doctors to understand the bleak realities of these unique situations. This accurate depiction is most likely down to Filer\u2019s personal experience as a psychiatric nurse (Sanai 2014), as he was seemingly able to amalgamate his previous experience to create the protagonist, Matthew. This study utilises reader response data. Reader response data is seen as a \"rigorous and evidence based\" approach to understanding reader interactions with a text (Whiteley and Canning 2017). Fish (1970) discusses how a text comes into being through reader interaction. Therefore, reader response data allows us to seek, understand and interpret reader\u2019s interactions with certain texts through different means, which is why it is utilised within this research to determine factors of alignment within reader reviews. The basis of this research surrounds Oatley\u2019s (1995;1999) theory discussing alignment with a text. Oatley (1999) argues there are two positions a reader adopts; \"identification\" or \"observer\". He believes that the observer is a spectator role, in which we are an objective outsider in a narrative, whereas identification occurs when a reader aligns themselves with the protagonist, taking on their goals and emotions. Moreover, he argues that a first-person narrative favours identification, whereas third-person narratives favour the spectatorobserver role. Identification is therefore seen as an intense alignment with the protagonist, with Oatley stating we \"become that person\" in the narrative (Oatley 1999, 446), made ever more present if the reader can sympathise with the protagonist through personal experience (Oatley 1995). However, it is important to note that these alignments are part of a scale where readers have autonomy, as opposed to having a fixed state in one position. To analyse the position of identification or observer, one of the methods I will be using is metaphor analysis. Lakoff and Johnson\u2019s (1980) \u2018conceptual metaphor theory\u2019 highlights how we better understand an entity when it is described in relation to another. It shows how metaphors can be \"extended\", allowing us to map the meaning within a metaphor in order to gauge the full detail of the comparison. Dirven et al (2003) highlight the significance of the theory, arguing conceptual metaphor theory ignited the importance of metaphor for our understanding of knowledge. Metaphors are useful in conjunction with noticing the identifierobserver role, as the way a reader discusses their experience of reading is often linked to their level of submersion and alignment with the protagonist and the text. Stockwell (2009) and Gerrig (1993) discuss metaphors more centred around reading. Stockwell (extending knowledge outlined by Gerrig) discusses metaphors that can be used by readers to describe their reading experience. These include \"reading is a journey\", \"reading as transport\" and \"reading as control\" (Stockwell 2009, 80-81). Stockwell (2005, 144) believes critical theorists should \"engage with the texture of the text\", which allows us to read as one does when they are simply reading for enjoyment; a \"natural reader\". With \u2018Good Reads\u2019 being a platform for mostly natural readers, we can see how utilising this method will allow inferences for reader position to emerge, as the reviewers discuss their experiences in a natural way, therefore giving their natural alignment with the text. I will also be drawing on conceptions of \u2018stake inoculation\u2019 and \u2018category entitlement\u2019 within my analysis. Stake inoculation can be identified when a reader is not presenting a vested interest in a text, and has been described as readers wanting to be \"regarded as considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306). Category entitlement, however, is defined as when certain people in specific situations are given authority for their knowledge in a specific area (Potter 1996). These features can be linked to the need to keep a \"positive face\" that is protected and maintained with the social space (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967). Reviewers may use stake inoculation andor category entitlement in order to portray themselves in a positive light for other reviewers, especially because the site is seen as a \"social network for book reviews\" (Fay 2012). Methodology I began my naturalistic study by sourcing reviews from the open access website \u2018Good Reads\u2019; a book reviewing website. This website was useful as it allows users to interact with reviews through \u2018likes\u2019, as well as having a rating system (one to five stars) to review the book discussed. As a result, I was able to find the most \u2018liked\u2019 reviews within each rating category. By choosing the most \u2018liked\u2019 reviews, the assumption can be made that the views described within the review reflect the majority, as they were the most widely interacted with. After selecting the most liked review from each rating category, I anonymised each review, by naming them R1 (being the review with a one-star rating) to R5 (being the review with a five-star rating), ensuring no ethical issues in relation to confidentiality could occur (See Appendix for full reviews). I then used \u2018NVivo\u2019; a form of qualitative data analysis software, to begin my analysis. I \u2018coded\u2019 each review in NVivo, which then highlighted areas where there were common themes among each review. This allowed me to make inferences as to the common themes that link to identificationobservation (Oatley 1999) within each of the rating categories. Analysis Comparing uses of Category Entitlement: One of the most common themes across all of the reviews is category entitlement. All of the reviewers, in one way or another, highlighted their authority within their review. The interesting part about comparing the uses of category entitlement is the difference in tone that occurs depending on how positive or negative the review is. The more negative reviews use this device in order to depict how The Shock of The Fall was a bad novel, because they identified better with certain other novels (R1 and R2). Whereas, the more positive reviews show their identification with The Shock of The Fall by providing examples of other mental health literature that has also made them feel this way (R3, R4 and R5). For example, R5 states they have read \"a number of books regarding mental illness\", but describes this text as \"purely unique\". On the other hand, R1 argues \"I would never recommend this book considering the wealth of options available to readers [\u2026]\". Peplow et al (2015, 75) discuss how you can put yourself forward as having \"expert knowledge\", which can be seen through the intentional discussion of broader knowledge. However, they also discuss how readers can \"play down\" their entitlement, which is also present through the subtle portrayals of wider reading as opposed to more direct mentions of expert knowledge (Peplow et al 2015, 74). As \u2018Good Reads\u2019 is a platform that invites avid readers, one could argue that a participant of the site would likely house a level of category entitlement simply due to this fact, and therefore their broad knowledge of literature would most likely be conveyed within their reviews, intentionally or not. Moreover, the fact that the website has open access means some reviewers may want to portray, and maintain, a \u2018positive face\u2019 (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967), which can be achieved through the use of category entitlement. Therefore, the comparative aspect category entitlement allows the users to present their identificationobservation with the text. Although in another breadth of mental illness, a study into the effects of reading novels about eating disorders showed participants felt their mood and self-confidence diminished, whilst other genres improved their mood (Troscianko 2018). Despite being about a very different aspect of mental health, I believe these findings highlight how the genre one chooses to focus on can have such ingrained effects on themselves as a reader. In a similar way to Oatley\u2019s (1995) statement about how a reader identifies more intensely if they can empathise with a reader from their personal experience, you could argue that reading fiction of this genre highlights how different forms of mental health literature ignite different reactions for certain individuals. Where the more positive reviews name novels that depict mental health in a way that has \"fascinated\" them (R4) and highlight their appreciation for such literature (R5, R3), the more negative reviews could arguably be having a similar reaction to that laid out in the study mentioned (Troscianko 2018) through their preference of other mental health literature (R2), therefore showing the use of comparison to determine alignment with the text. As the readers all portray themselves to have a broad knowledge of literature, we can see how a novel of such unique nature could create conflicting responses depending on the reviewers individual understanding and perceptions of mental health literature more generally. Therefore, we can see that all of the reviews utilise category entitlement as a device to compare The Shock of the Fall to other texts of a similar vein, which therefore portrays their level of observationidentification depending on how they \u2018rank\u2019 this text compared to others they discuss. Emotive vs Clinical Language \u2013 Comparing uses of Reading Metaphors and Stake Inoculation: Reading metaphors (Stockwell 2009; Gerrig 1993) are an insightful way to decipher the identificationobserver positioning. Stockwell (2009,80) identifies a number of metaphors commonly used by readers; reading is \"transport\", reading is \"control\", and reading is \"investment\". As these responses can be aligned more directly with an investment with the reading material, it isn\u2019t entirely unsurprising that the two top rated reviews are the only reviews which give examples of this use of metaphor. The more positive reviews actively present themselves as having an identification stance through their use of reading metaphors. R5 described being \"grabbed\" and \"held\" by the book, providing an example of the \"reading as control\" metaphor that Stockwell (2009, 80) discusses. As this is the most highly rated review, which speaks very positively about the novel as a whole, is it not surprising that the reader feels so invested in the narrative. However, despite R4 being mostly positive, the metaphors used within their review do not reflect their identification in the same way. R4 utilises \"reading as transport\" (Stockwell 2009, 80) through feelings of being lost in the narrative; \"at times you have to try and remember where you are\", as well as describing the narrative as \"following\" the narrator. Here, the use of metaphor seems to have less intensity; they are not being controlled in the same sense that R5 describes. However, there is still a clear alignment presented, as the reviewer is situated within the narrative for the feeling of being \"lost\" to occur. Although \"following\" for R4 is not as intense of a description as \"grabbed\" and \"held\" in R5, we can see that there is still a level of alignment that is arguably understandable from their different review ratings (as R4 rated the novel slightly lower than R5). Their difference also highlights Oatley\u2019s argument that aligning with a text is part of a scale, therefore R4 simply isn\u2019t as far on the \u2018identification scale\u2019 as R5. Therefore, we can see that the use of metaphor for the more positive reviews shows the level of identification that the readers feel through their embodiment of the text. On the other hand, it is interesting how some of the negative reviews use stake inoculation, which directly contrasts the intense feeling described by the reading metaphors portrayed in the positive reviews. Where the positive reviewers use metaphor in order to portray an alignment with the text, R3 and R2 speak about the same harrowing events within the novel, yet do not use the same language to describe the experience. R2 states very blatantly \"Matt is haunted by his dead brother\", whilst R3 states \"This is an interesting read that deals with mental illness, more particularly schizophrenia, as a result of a boy\u2019s grief over the death of his older brother.\". Where other more positive reviews have discussed the physical grip and transportation that the portrayal of the protagonist\u2019s mental health had on them, we can see with R2 and R3 that there is a very clinical, blunt approach to discussing the topic. Stake inoculation is about a portrayal of being \"considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306), which, when discussing mental health, shows why some who wish to portray themselves in this way would use such clinical language to describe the text. Peplow (2011) discusses how a reader\u2019s positive face can be at risk if they engage in explaining their personal interpretation of a text due to judgement from other readers, therefore this could indicate why some of the reviewers, on a site that is based so largely on user interaction, could use stake inoculation as a means to deter this judgement. The stark comparison between the positive and negative reviews shows how having an identification stance clearly impacts your perception of a text, as those that do identify describe their reading experience with so much more intensity. On the other hand, the clinical approach of the negative reviews highlights that they simply observed the events without gaining any form of attachment to the protagonist or his struggles, giving a fairly alternate reading experience. Perceptions of Accuracy: The majority of the reviews comment on Filer\u2019s accurate depiction of mental health within the novel, arguing his background as a psychiatric nurse enhanced his ability to portray expert knowledge on the topic. Therefore, we can see, even within the negative reviews, one of the main praises is through this depiction of accuracy. However, the important distinction between the positive and negative reviews, despite all of them praising the accurate depiction, is that some reviews can empathise with the accurate depiction, whereas others can simply appreciate. The most negative review, R1, states their appreciation for the accuracy very blatantly; \"\u2026it presents a very realistic glimpse of what mental illness looks and feels like\". Here we see no language that attaches the reader to the narrative; they are embodying the essence of an observer role. R2 is less clinical in language, yet still places themselves outside of the story world; \"You do get a very strong sense of the mental bind that some patients\u2026 get into once they\u2019re sucked into the mental health biz\u2026\". R2 is very informal throughout, therefore their discussion of the accuracy continues this informal language to convey their observer position. This review uses emotive language to describe the actual events of the novel (\"mental bind\", \"sucked into\"), but this language is solely attached to the narrative and not their emotions in relation to said narrative. Similar to the use of stake inoculation discussed previously, the clinical language is used within the more negative reviews as a means to distance themselves from the narrative. Therefore, we can see that again, with such a sensitive topic, the clinical language allows these reviewers to avoid being seen as prejudice (Peplow 2011) by simply outlining events as opposed to exposing their own opinions of said events. On the other hand, with the more positive reviews, the accuracy only seemed to add to their levels of identification. R5 states \"He [Filer] does not idealise the staff or the patients, both of them have good days and bad days and this was remarkably refreshing.\". Moreover, R3 states \"It is a daring but successful endeavour on the part of the author to unravel the tangled world a person with schizophrenia lives in.\". Here, we can see that identificationobservation is part of a scale, as both the most highly rated review and the neutral review use emotive language which signifies identification. R3\u2019s use of emotive language (\"daring\", \"unravel\", \"tangled\") in isolation invite the assumption of heightened identification, but when we assess within the entire review, this isn\u2019t the case. Whereas R5 discusses the accuracy in the expected manner due to their consistent identification. Oatley (1999) believes first-person narratives invite more of an \"identification\" role, which is reflected within these reviews. Those that do identify can be seen to enter the story world and therefore take on the emotions of the protagonist, meaning the accurate depiction seemingly made this embodiment even more intense. Moreover, Oatley (1995) argues that emotions arise whenif a reader can empathise with the story characters and their struggles, particularly from personal experience, which could indicate why some reviews discuss the text with such identification; if a reader has had personal experiences that are similar to the protagonist, they may be able to identify more heavily than someone who cannot relate in the same way. When we assess the discussion of accuracy from all of the reviewers, we can see that accuracy as a feature within a novel does not create a heightened level of observation or identification, but instead can be analysed as a discussion point to assess the position of observationidentification. In other words, in some cases it is important to see how readers discuss aspects of a text, as opposed to the specific aspect itself. With this example, language analysis is the focal device to understand the identificationobserver role, as well as highlighting how alignment with a text causes fairly distinctive differences in perceptions of key themes. Conclusion Despite using a small data set, I believe there is clear evidence about the factors that indicate the identificationobserver role in relation to The Shock of the Fall, and therefore the aim of this research has been met. It emerged that the positive reviews had identification with the text (seen through emotive language and use of metaphor), and the negative reviews were more observational (seen through stake inoculation and clinical language). However, the slight inconsistencies of these patterns highlight Oatley\u2019s argument that identificationobservation is part of a scale as opposed to two polarised positions. Should this research be extended with a larger data set, I believe more evidence would arise to reflect this scale, and present that not all negative reviews are entirely observational, and not all positive reviews show identification. It seems the best device to assess the identificationobservation within the reviews was language analysis. The comparison between the different reviews showed that it isn\u2019t necessarily the presence of certain linguistic factors (for example category entitlement), but the discussion of such that show reader positioning; language analysis shows the device as an entity does not lead to an understanding of reader position, but the way it is utilised does.", "positive": "glad you liked it!!

{"id": "aug_539", "anchor": "Employment relations is a process of socio-economic exchange, and involves a individual performing service or duty in exchange for payment. Employment relations looks at the different aspects of a relationship between an employee and its employer. Employment relations have a major impact on the UK labour market, this statement is supported by ONS report on the UK labour market which shows from November 2017, there are approximately 32 million people at work with more than half being employed. The UK government is crucial with regards to employment relations to ensure they are able to meet the key goals of the country. The government acts as the economic manager, this consist of setting the level of wages, tax rate and managing the cost of living. The government are also classed as regulators of labour markets, this involves initiating new laws and regulations that have an impact upon the relationship between employer and employee. In addition, they play act as the welfare state, ensuring they are able to aid those who have been made redundant or struggling with financial difficulties. Being the largest employer with 5.39 million workers employed, the government sees itself as a eloquent employer and wants to show private sectors how to do this. This report will look the role the government plays with regards to gender equality in the UK. There has been an improvement in the amount of females in the labour market. Since the beginning, there has always been more men employed them women. The office of national statistics shows during the third quarter of 2020, 78.6% of men were employed opposed to the 71.9% of women who have been employed, a difference of just under 7%, this is near enough the lowest the difference has ever been and is a huge improvement considering the gap was 11.5% ten years ago. These numbers have however been affected heavily by the covid-19 pandemic. The employment rates of males has remained around 70%, however females have increased immensely. Since the great recession in 2008 in which women employment was roughly 67%, women employment has increased by around 5%. ONS suggests that women employment was at an all time high in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic of 72.6%, showing a positive change from 52.8% in 1971. The changes in state pension age for women has had a slight impact on this increase meaning less females retiring between the ages of 60-65. This increase in the number of women in the labour market has initiated a positive attitude towards the support of gender equality. There are several reasons for the growth in numbers of females in the workforce, one huge reason is the government acting as regulators of labour markets and initiating laws, these laws include the lone parent income support and equality act 2010, equality and human right commission, employment act 2008 and equality act 2006. From the start of 2008 to 2010, male employment rate went down by 4%, whereas for females just under 2% due to so many being made redundant. The years following the UK recession saw a loss in numbers of female full time workers, but an improvement in the number of part time employees. Fortunately, since the end of 2012 the full time employment has grown. During recession, many organisations recruited part time workers and full time workers were made redundant to help with labour costs and still have the same productivity from employees. This process is referred to as labour market flexibility, (Bell and Blanchflower, 2010). And is a process that the state were supportive of to help get the labour market back to the equilibrium, and was beneficial for part time employees. To have a greater effect, the UK government should have implemented a different strategy in order to support all those affected with the great recession. Despite many efforts for many years, gender equality is still a major and worldwide issue within the workplace. The global gender gap report 2020 stated there are \"massive inequalities in almost all of the UK\u2019s fasted-growing job clusters of the future\", this is a worrying stat as in order to sustain an effective workforce in the future, it is crucial that women are able to access resources that would aid the upbringing of children, inevitably the future labour market. Improvement in gender equality in the workplace with regards to the opportunities available, would allow women to contribute and support the UK economy. A study conducted by PwC (2020), suggests \"steps have been made towards advancing gender equality, however progress is slow\". This statement comes from results showing that the UK\u2019s position remaining at 16th however still doing better than OECD average. Another major and insightful fact from this study reports that if the UK were able to achieve the same level of female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by a staggering $252 billion. This supports the importance of allowing women the same opportunities and resources as men and pushing the gender equality agenda, because of the great impact it could have on the UK economy. An article written by the guardian states, \"the UK has fallen from 15th to 21st\" with regards to being the most equal nation. Although there has been progress in the number of women in the labour market, the UK are still far below its European neighbours with the gender equality rankings and shows that gender inequality is still of a major concern. Another major dilemma within the workforce is gender pay gap which supports the gender inequality regime. 8,424 private sector employers reported their data, with 3,746 employers noticing their pay gap improve whilst 3,387 seeing pay gap worsen, and 645 employers seeing no change. This supports that the statement that gender equality is still an issue. However, with regards to part-time employees women on average earn more, a possible reason for females earning more in part time field is it gives them flexibility to complete other commitments meaning more women doing part-time and higher earnings. The state of UK has played its role with the improvement in the gender pay gap with the policies and laws that have been legislated. Companies with more than 50 employees are now required to execute an equal pay audit, this identifies any differences in pay between men and women doing equal work. As an employer, doing an audit shows your dedication to remove any unfair pay. This comes as a part of the equal pay act 2010, which came into force to give both men and women a right to equal pay for equal work and has been implemented to protect people from discrimination. In 2017, it was compulsory for any company with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gap report, this comes as change as originally companies could publish this voluntarily. A negative to this law is that it is only compulsory for companies to report, however not actually make amendments to the pay gap. Since the beginning of gender pay gap being analysed, this issue has still not been resolved and could still be a problem for the foreseeable future, this comes as a result of the lack of determination from the UK government to resolve this issue. To help minimise gender pay gap and to resolve the issue of pay inequality, national minimum wage was enacted as a plan. This is significant as this was the UK governments\u2019 first national and cross-sectural attempt to regulate low pay. Dube (2017) found that in America for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, over the long run, the poverty rate is expected to decline by 5.3 percent, this emphasises the importance of minimum wage. In 2016, national living wage was implemented to help and support females in the workforce, however with the increase of the minimum national living wage by 4.9% in 2019, nearly 3 million children are still in poverty with parents who are at work. This proves that it is still of a major concern. Women make up 60% of workers on the national living wage, meaning at least one third of females are not on a wage that they could live on. The Fawcett society also mentioned that increasing the minimum wage to the real living wage, would help in resolving the gender pay gap issue. With regards to public sector, the government are doing there best to set an example to private sector companies, this is evident as an article from the public finance states that based on the number of employees in the senior government roles, UK is top in the EU and only fourth in the G20 nations. Presently, the gender pay gap amongst all employees in the public sector is 15.5%, which is a slight improvement, as in the last decade the gap has increased by roughly 4%. The most recent data conducted by ONS was in 2018, and suggests there has been an increase of 10.9 percentage points from 31 march 2008 to 31 march 2018 which at that point was 42.7% of female employees working at senior civil service level. This is a positive sign and shows gradual improvement year by year. In the executive officer and administrate responsibility levels, there are more females then male employees. Females still dominate with the number of civil service employees, however decreased by 0.1% from 2018 to 2019 which is not a positive sign. To prevent gender inequality occurring within the public sector, the government have enacted public sector equality duty. PSED \"requires public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity\" (Fredman, 2011).and ensure good relations between employees. This act requires public authorities to published quality objectives every four years as a minimum, also information to show they are cooperating with the public sector equality duty. PSED has yet to accomplish the goals it was set out to perform, as gender inequality is still present within the public sector. ONS shows that gender pay gap still exists amongst all of the professions within the public sector, showing more still needs to be done to resolve gender inequality. This affects the government\u2019s stance as aiming to be a role model, and portrays a negative image for the private sector employers. The UK government has attempted to find the perfect solution for gender inequality and has done this through various techniques including creating new laws to tackle the issues. There are still many issues occurring presently such as , gender pay gap, the number of females in the higher positions in contrast to males, the significant amount of women who are not on a wage that they could live on. One major law that was implemented by the government which was crucial was the Equality act 2010, this was a good intervention is helping with equality, however both males and females being represented equally still seems to be on concern. Equal pay has gradually been improving, however still seems a long way from the end goal, a solution to this could be a stricter approach towards companies like setting deadlines, ensuring equal pay becomes a priority for companies. To help with the millions of females who struggle to earn a wage to live on, the government should make this a priority by encouraging organisations to pay the real living wage and to make it mandatory. The national minimum wage is a positive for low pay workers (which is dominated by females), however there are still millions who earn less than the real living wage. Therefore the government need to implement new strategies to tackle this. The positions of more authority within organisations still have majority of men as the employees, the government should encourage females to apply for these higher positions by showing other women who have been able to become employees of these top positions, this could be used as motivation for females to feel that they are also able to achieve these roles. It is vital that the skills and potential of women in the UK are used to a maximum, as mentioned previously if the UK were able to reach the same female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by $252 billion, which would help decrease the gender pay gap and boost the economy significantly. This shows if the UK government are able to fulfil their roles efficiently as the biggest employers, and regulators of labour market, they could definitely help with gender inequality in the UK", "positive": ", I was just wondering if i would be able to change some of my modules for 2nd semester, or has the deadline passed?

{"id": "aug_547", "anchor": "The subjective expected utility theory (Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1944; Savage, 1954) is a theory within decision making which aims to provide a way of optimal decision making. This theory consists of 5 different axioms which assign utility outcomes in a way that it can maximise their expected utility in any decision one makes. These axioms include preferences, transitivity, indifferent, preference and no alternative being infinitely better than other. 1. Preferences being well ordered means that two possible outcomes, (A and B) either A would be preferring to B or B to A, otherwise, the decision maker is known to be indifferent meaning they do not care which one becomes known. 2. Preferences being transitive refers to A being preferred to B, as well as B being preferred over C therefore, A would be preferred to C as well. This way it is in relation. 3. Furthermore, being indifferent between A and B, means that only one has outcome A in such a gamble, however they both hold the same level of probability. 4. Preference. This means that if I like A to B, I will not change my preference even if I am offered a third option (C). 5. Lastly, no alternative being infinitely better than any other. In this case, if one prefers A to B and B to C, there are chances of probabilistic mixture of A to C, as they are indifferent between B and that mixture. From these 5 axioms, 3 principles have been derived via psychological experiments. Transitivity, indifference, and preference. Transitivity does not always hold due to \u2018single mindfulness\u2019 (focusing on a single attribute while excluding other attributes which are important for a decision) therefore A will not necessarily be preferred to C. Furthermore, indifferent has been proved wrong by \u2018framing\u2019 by the Asian-flu problem (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981). People tend to point out the negative losses more. Lastly, Allias paradox (Allais, 1953) proves that invariance does not always uphold as people tend to pick the certain option.", "positive": ", I hope you are back in office safely, today.

{"id": "aug_551", "anchor": "r Dr. , I am a first-year student studying . I was advised by my personal tutor to forward my email to my and directors. I understand that you are the head of at . So, I hope you can help me or direct me to the correct staff. I have also emailed the director of and undergraduate matters. I apologise in advance for the lengthy email. I I hope you are doing well and hope the Covid-19 situation has not affected you too much. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made a big impact on me and my family. For my well-being, I have had to move to from my family home in . So, what I can understand from the university updates via email is that term 1 (Second year of university - ) will consist of mainly online teaching but some on-campus learning. I wanted to know and confirm whether it would okay for me to stay here and continue with my online learning here in . In regard to on-campus learning, I would make use of the resources available online and make my tutors also aware weekly or however they prefer. For example, if there are seminars I would do the work and reading notes electronically and then send them to my seminar leaders and interact with students I know from that class but online instead. This way the University does know I am continuing with my studies. Or if there is any group work, I could communicate with group members online via emailtextSkype. If I did have to come onto campus to present or for any other important reason I could travel to for a week. There are options for me transferring universities or taking a year out however for myself I do love going to because it is a great way of distracting myself and I love the environment. Hopefully, for only a short period things at home in are not good and I thought I would stay in with my relatives that live here and they are supporting me and keeping me distracted. At least till , and I may as well use the Covid-19 online teaching to its advantage. In terms of adapting to the changes being made at university because of Covid-19. I believe I would not face any difficulties when I return because I have been actively going out in public due to the fact I am a key worker at a local . So, I am fully aware and have adapted to the new rules and social distancing, etc. I hope you can let me know if I am okay doing this. And if there are any other tutors or Staff that I should make aware of my decisionsituation. Please feel free to ask me any questions if it will help you understand the situation. And if you would like me to clarify or explain how I will still make sure to keep up with everything. Thank you.

{"id": "aug_554", "anchor": "\"The mercantile law\u2026 is the same all over the world. For\u2026 the same premises, the sound conclusions of reason and justice must universally be the same\". This opinion led to the signing of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) in 1980, coming into force on 1st January 1988. Operating on \"contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places of business are in different States\", and aiming to provide a set of default, harmonised rules to be applied in the absence of specified terms, the CISG has been adopted in ninety-four states as of September 2020. However, the UK is not a signatory; instead, English sale of goods law is governed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979. The dominance of English law in this field, demonstrated by the mirroring of it within the Hong Kong Sale of Goods Ordinance, means that if the UK ratified the Convention, it would undermine the position of its domestic law, potentially causing the loss of its international status. This alongside the CISG\u2019s civil law influences, resulting in \"rules foreign to\u2026 the common law\u2019 of the UK, and the lack of comprehensive cover offered by the Convention, with no mention of areas including the passing of property, makes it \u2018less suitable to commodity sales than the English Sale of Goods Act\u2019. As such, the UK government has historically seen no demand for ratification of the CISG. The commercial law on international sale of goods \"aims at establishing certainty and trust and the reduction of transaction costs\". In exploring and comparing the remedies available under both the CISG and SGA, this essay will examine the extent to which English domestic law remains capable of this; or whether the Convention \"would be a useful addition to (or in certain circumstances, replacement of) English sale of goods law as it currently exists\". Overall, I will argue that English common law promotes the most commercial certainty, and therefore ratification of the CISG is not required as an addition or replacement of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. Remedies Typical of a common law jurisdiction, English law adopts a restrictive approach to remedies. Under which, the measurement used for determining remedies available is the importance to the parties of the contractual obligation being breached \u2013 differentiating between breach of a major term (\"condition\") and a lesser term (\"warranty\"). However, the classification of each term remains a matter for judicial interpretation based on the construction of the contract; this dual system being criticised as overly simplistic. The trivialisation was demonstrated when the Court of Appeal first made reference to a third classification \u2013 \u2018innominate\u2019 terms \u2013 whereby a breach may or may not lead to the right of repudiation, depending on the severity of the breach. Meanwhile, the CISG was designed considering the special characteristics of the international sale of goods, including the long distances involved, costs of transportation and length of the term of the contracts. To accommodate such factors, the Convention adopts a more permissive remedial approach, as common for a civil law jurisdiction. Set out in Article 45(1) and 61(1), remedies available depend on the breach severity, measured in relation to a \u2018fundamental breach\u2019, as defined to be an act that \"results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract\" . However, the Article \"does not provide clear guidelines for distinguishing fundamental breach from non-fundamental ones\" and case law, such as Doolim Corp v R Doll and Bundesgericht, does not clarify the differentiation either. As such, both the CISG and English law provide similar provisions for determining remedies available, each resulting in uncertainty. Initially, the warranty and conditions system under the SGA appears to promote certainty considering s12-15 SGA establish items designated to be conditions and warranties. However, the mention of \"innominate terms\u2026 'fatally' remove[s this] element of certainty which is an essential provision in contracts and gives rise to an increasing number of arbitrations\". Similarly, Grebler details the uncertainty associated with defining \u2018fundamental breach\u2019 under the CISG in terms of the phasing of Article 25; explaining how the conditions, exceptions and affirmative statements within the same sentence antagonise its accurate interpretation. Hence demonstrating that both systems harbour their own uncertainty; failing to imply one is any more favourable than the other. Damages Under the SGA 1979, damages serve as the primary remedy \u2013 drawing \"a distinction between a provision for a \"penalty\", which is not valid, and a provision for \"liquidated damages,\" which is valid\". Whilst other remedies exist under domestic law, and \"parties are generally free to choose their own remedies, English law will not enforce all the remedies, at least not to the same degree\". Alternatively, damages are also available under Article 74 of the CISG, which places no limit on the amount of compensation that parties can agree to pay upon breach of contract. To the same effect, damages under the CISG can also be claimed in conjunction with other remedies provided overcompensation does not occur. This flexible approach can also be seen in the principle of freedom of contract in Article 6, whereby parties can derogate from the Convention, including Article 74, in order to replace them with bespoke clauses, such as one on remedy and damages available. National law would then govern the validity of such clauses, which will be upheld in place of their CISG alternative, as seen in ICC International Court of Arbitration Award No 99781999. This being said, whilst this gives parties the freedom to establish their own remedies, they will not necessarily be enforced uniformly between countries as elements such as penal clauses are a matter of public policy, to be dictated by the jurisdiction in which the contract operates. This demonstrates that whilst \"[the] CISG approach has the merit of being more transparent and truer to the commercial purpose of very many contracts\u2026 the Sale of Goods Act approach\u2026 may be the easier to apply\". The Convention undeniably allows for a more flexible approach to damages, compared to the more limited scope of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. However, if this flexible approach, caveated by domestic law, cannot be applied and interpreted uniformly, it fails to provide the harmonisation of law that it aims to achieve; instead generating uncertainty that would be detrimental, and not a useful addition, to English law if incorporated. Specific performance The doctrine of specific performance \"reflect[s] the principle\u2026 that the law should compel parties specifically to perform their contractual obligations\". Under English law, a remedy of specific performance is available under s52 SGA 1979 but is only available to the buyer, and is only granted in exceptionally rare circumstances where the \"courts of equity were without jurisdiction unless the remedy at law was inadequate\", as demonstrated by Lord Hoffman in Co-Operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores. Whilst the doctrine in theory \"applies to all cases where the goods are specific or ascertained, whether the property has passed to the buyer or not\", there is no guarantee that the court will always exercise its discretion and enforce specific performance, even in instances where the buyer has struggled to obtain replacement goods such as custom machinery or a ship. As such, this discretionary approach under English law demonstrates a lack of uniformity in application that has been criticised for being detrimental to commercial certainty. Concurrently, under Articles 46 of the CISG, a \"buyer may require performance of the seller of his obligations unless the buyer has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement\", with a mirrored provision for the seller under Article 62. The lack of a requirement for the goods to be specific and identified under the contract, allows these articles to avoid \"some of the uncertainty associated with the scope of specific performance under the SGA\". However, \"due to the divergent common-law and civil-law perceptions\u2026, the\u2026 CISG included article 28 as a compromise\", which \"seeks to preserve domestic law regarding the availability of specific performance\". As such, \"a court is not bound to enter a judgment for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law\", as demonstrated in Magellan International Corporation v Salzgitter Hanbdel GmbH. This article therefore makes the remedy of specific performance discretionary rather than mandatory, and creates its own uncertainty as this caveat is \"disruptive [of] the Conventions underlying goal of uniformity\". Overall, the approach of English law means that the \"precise scope of when a court might have the power or discretion to grant specific performance is\u2026 unclear\". The adoption of the CISG \"will have the opportunity to clarify English law on this point\", and may allow for the widening of the scope of application based on its less restrictive definition. However, the inclusion of Article 28 means that the CISG cannot replace domestic law on this matter, and given the reluctance of the English courts to enforce s52(1) SGA, it is unlikely that the addition of the CISG to English law would result in any expansion of the doctrine, or additional commercial certainty. Instead, it is likely to cause further confusion due to the lack of uniformity in its own application, thus resulting in further costs when settling the inevitable increase in related disputes. Granting of additional time (\u2018Nachfrist\u2019) The Sale of Goods Act 1979 contains no express remedy for the granting of additional time in order to perform contractual obligations. S10 of the Act contains stipulations regarding timing of contracts, deeming remedy only to be available on these grounds if timing is of the \u2018essence\u2019. Whilst the House of Lords confirmed that time stipulations in mercantile contracts will typically be considered to be of the essence, the shift away from considering breaches in terms of \u2018conditions\u2019 and \u2018warranties\u2019 results in further uncertainty. This being said, under English law the non-breaching party can grant additional time, as per s11(2) SGA, by waiving the original contractual term and establishing a new notice making the new time frame to be of the essence, as in Stickney v Keeble. Similarly, under the CISG, Articles 47 and 63 provide for the allowance of additional time as seen in civil jurisdictions, and referred to as Nachfrist after the similar German law remedy. Rooted in the CISG\u2019s aims of maintaining viability of contract, rather than avoiding them, Nachfrist allows for \u2018reasonable\u2019 periods of delay in performance of contracts. However, as with English law\u2019s approach, uncertainty stems from the \u2018reasonability\u2019 element of this requirement. Such uncertainty, leading to increasing disputes and ultimately higher costs of transaction, as in Germany Oberlandesgericht where whilst the original fixed period of two weeks agreed was deemed an \u2018unreasonable\u2019 addition, the seven weeks that followed were held to be \u2018reasonable\u2019 based on the facts. In both systems, whilst the approach differs, the granting of the additional period in both is seen to be a \"kind of estoppel\" preventing the non-defaulting party from seeking other remedies during this period, but for the avoidance of the contract if the additional period is not met. Equally, both systems \"give the defaulting party the protection of a reasonable time, at the expense of the innocent party's certainty of when a time period would be considered reasonable\". As such, there would unlikely be any benefit to incorporating the CISG into English law in this respect in terms of commercial certainty gained or expansion of the doctrine. Conclusion \"In Commercial Law, the parties plan and negotiate their transactions based on their understanding of the legal rules that govern their transactions, and in the expectation that these rules will remain\u2026 stable in the future.\" As such, to consider incorporating the CISG into English domestic law, there would have to be notable benefits associated to outbalance the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of the new rules. Having first come into effect in 1983, and not having been updated more recently than 1979, the Sale of Goods Act would benefit from expansion and modernisation. Comparatively to the CISG, the remedies available are far more restrictive, as demonstrated by the more restricted scope for damages and limited willingness to apply principles including specific performance and the granting of additional time. Whilst all such remedies are accounted for under both the SGA and the CISG, the SGA\u2019s approach has been criticised for giving insufficient gravitas to the complex and logistical nature of the international sale of goods. Comparatively, as the Convention borrows from a range of both common and civil law jurisdictions, it is considered to be more up to date with modern requirements of international trade, and representing of global best practices, for example catering for the \u2018reasonable\u2019 delays resulting from many transactions easily under Nachfrist rather than requiring the explicit waiving and recreation of terms. This being said, \"[an] extremely important goal for the CISG is to achieve\u2026 uniformity and certainty with regard to remedies available\", yet \"[no] international commercial legal regime can expect to be perfect, especially when it is developed on the basis of compromise between legal systems\". The required compromise is particularly evident in Article 28 of the CISG, explicitly giving domestic law superiority over the Convention in terms of specific performance. It is this compromise between common and civil jurisdictions that means that the CISG \u2018contains hidden complexities which can easily lead to errors\u2019, as in FilantoS.p.A. v Chilewich International Corp, that would likely result in an increased number of disputes if incorporated into English law. As such, I believe the outcome from the previous two consultations carried out by the UK Department of Trade and Industry on the possible incorporation of the CISG in 1989 and 1997 stands \u2013 ratification is not a priority. Whilst it would bring the UK in line with many of its global trading partners, \u2018in all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty\u2026 because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon\", and \"[no] matter what the merits or drawbacks of the CISG, it cannot instantly create the same measure of legal certainty and is therefore condemned to exclusion so long as English law, or rather courts and arbitrators applying English law, do their job well\". In kind, following PST Energy 7 Shipping v OW Bunker Malta (The \u2018Res Cogitans\u2019), \u2018many similar cases worldwide await[ed the] decision with interest\u2019, showing the global dominance of English law on the sale of goods remains intact. Thus, as it currently stands, the CISG remains an unnecessary addition to, or replacement for the law; instead, it should remain a guideline of global standards of best practice to which the UK can compare its own domestic law.", "positive": ", I have booked a appointment with you for 9:30am tomorrow - I am just putting in a Teams meeting for us to use for the feedback.

{"id": "aug_557", "anchor": "Thank you for visiting. Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders? To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee\u2019s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work. Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders? To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant\u2019s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC. Procedural requirements Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline. If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is \u00a352,000, any award exceeding \u00a325,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal. I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed. Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute. If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim? You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects, as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder\u2019s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. WDC Prospect It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee\u2019s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover. In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks\u2019 notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks\u2019 notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks\u2019 worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. UDC Prospect It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal\u2019s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. Applying this, WW may use \u2018other substantial reason,\u2019 ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be \u2018misconduct,\u2019 regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years. Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option? Please find below a list of options available to you. Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder\u2019s behaviour. Advantages: \u2022 You continue to have a regular job and income. \u2022 No stress about finding alternative work. \u2022 Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. Disadvantage: \u2022 Narinder\u2019s disrespectful behaviour may not change. \u2022 The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder\u2019s behaviour. Advantages: \u2022 Same as Option 1. \u2022 WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder\u2019s behaviour. \u2022 WW may assign you a new line manager. Disadvantage: \u2022 Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. Advantages: \u2022 Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. Disadvantage: \u2022 Same as Options 1-2. Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. Advantages: \u2022 You will be free from Narinder\u2019s treatment. \u2022 You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them. \u2022 You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. Disadvantages: \u2022 You will be unemployed after your notice period. \u2022 Stressful finding another job. Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC. Advantages: \u2022 You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. \u2022 You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour. \u2022 Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity. Disadvantages: \u2022 Same as Option 4. \u2022 There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim? WDC The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks\u2019 worth salary (\u00a310,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately \u00a34,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (\u00a31,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your \u2018Christmas [bonus]\u2019 regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual \u2018right[s] to receive.\u2019 Currently, you have taken two days\u2019 leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days\u2019 worth salary (\u00a33,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. Your compensation totals \u00a319,263.96. This includes notice salary (\u00a310,000), Pension (\u00a34,000), untaken leave (\u00a33,703.96) and Christmas bonus (\u00a31,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals \u00a317,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals \u00a311,763.96 or \u00a310,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal\u2019s maximum award of \u00a325,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. UDC The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. Basic Award Tribunal will award you \u00a36,300 based on your weekly gross salary (\u00a3525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. Compensatory Award The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (\u00a378,000), as it is below \u00a386,444 cap. This may be lower (\u00a325,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job. If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (\u00a384,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this. The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. Additional information Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract. Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. Yours Sincerely,", "positive": "r , I hope you\u2019re well.

{"id": "aug_560", "anchor": "Background Specsavers, founded in 1984 by Doug and Mary Perkins, is the world\u2019s largest privately-owned optical group, (Corporate Eyecare - about us | Specsavers UK, 2020) with 1,845 stores operating in 10 countries. (Experience Specsavers - Working at Specsavers - Specsavers People, 2020) Specsavers operates on a joint venture partnership, with each store owned and operated by local partners, who are qualified opticians. These partners are committed to delivering the highest standard of customer service. Definition of the Business Problem Specsavers stores, along with any other opticians, deal with interactions on a daily basis, whether it be in-store or via telephone. However, a lot of the time, these interactions are related to minor queries such as bookingre-arrangingcancelling appointments, checking upcoming appointment details, requesting prescriptions, or checking if glasses are in stock. Currently, the option to book appointments online via the store website and cancel via the email sent regarding appointment booking confirmation is available. This has lowered the number of calls and walk-ins by a significant amount however there are still a large number of individuals who are unaware of this option. Consequently, time is taken up during the day. The directors of stores are constantly seeking ways of improving customer service. To do this, they need to understand how effective technology is in providing individuals with more freedom and the access to information from any location without having to visit or call a store. The research findings will be used to review and improve the technology. Research Objectives The key question this research should answer therefore is: \u2022 How would the launch of an app benefit or worsen customers experiences and overall interactions with Specsavers? Target Population The target profile identified is as follows: \u2022 Customers who own a smartphone device \u2022 Customers who visit Specsavers \u2022 \u2018Direct Debit\u2019 scheme patients \u2022 Individuals who wear glasses andor contact lenses Research Design and Strategy Based on the research objectives, it is recommended that a quantitative research design is implemented through the use of online questionnaires. Questionnaires are a \"set of questions designed to produce the data needed in order to meet the research objectives\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). The aim of this research is: \"To gain an insight into individuals\u2019 preferences as to whether or not they believe they would benefit from the launch of an app.\" The questionnaire will consist of various questions where the participant will rate their opinion using a Likert scale: \"A measurement scale where the respondent indicates a level of agreement or disagreement to the given statements\u2026\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). An example of the questionnaire is shown by appendix 1. This method is most favourable as the sample population is large. Other survey methods such as telephone interviews or face-to-face interviews are time consuming as they require an individual (usually an experienced interviewer) to contact the participant and have a conversation with them. Therefore, for this research it is impractical. It is advised having a sample size of n=400, however, having a read of n=80 or above for each subgroup will allow to draw strong conclusions. The advantage is that it will be easier to analyse results amongst the subgroups specified in the target population. Quantitative methods aim for conclusiveness and generalisability. Therefore, once there is solid evidence to support the question, no further testing is required. Sampling Approach The most appropriate sampling technique is cluster sampling. This technique is part of \"probability sampling where the population is divided into groups\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018) and then randomly sampled from each group. This is the preferred method as it allows to select an equal number of participants per group, allowing for fairness and reliability. Cluster sampling involves gathering the entire population of the study and dividing them into clusters. Each cluster is a representation of the entire population. Once the clusters have been identified, certain clusters will be chosen using simple random sampling. Only the participants who meet one or more of the \u2018Target Population\" criteria will be used for the study. The unchosen clusters (those who do not meet the criteria) will remain unrepresented in the study. For this study, participants will be grouped by age, and then participants will be chosen randomly to be included in the data analysis. 100 participants per age group will be selected to allow fairness. Data Collection Method and Analysis As mentioned previously, online questionnaires will be used due to the type of research being conducted and the size of the target sample population. Questionnaires will be sent out to every individual who has provided an e-mail address to Specsavers and given consent to receive the questionnaire. Online questionnaires allow the researcher to contact multiple participants at once. As a result, they have higher response rates as well as the ability to contact the hard-to-reach. Moreover, it is quick to create and allows for adaptability and personalisation of questions. There are no physical materials needed to send the questionnaire (paper, envelope etc.) so there are fewer expenses incurred. There may also be less bias as without an interviewer present, respondents are able to answer truthfully. Additionally, anonymity also encourages truthful answers. Respondents will be given 4 weeks to complete the questionnaire from the date of visit to the store. Once completed, the results will be put onto a spreadsheet categorised by age (groups of 10 years). Once all 400 responses have been recorded, it will be analysed by calculating the averages of each question. This will help identify what customers prefer or not. For example, an average score of 1-3 shows customers disagree with the statements, 4 shows they are neutral, and a score between 5-7 means they agree. The ratings will give a good indication on whether it is beneficial to launch the app, and what features should be included. A timings and costings table has been provided in the appendix (appendix 2) to highlight a more detailed overview of the length of the research project (3 months) and the total cost of the research project (\u00a328,000). Ethical Issues There are many ethical principles regarding the use of online surveys, the most important one being informed consent \u2013 participants within reason know what they are going to be doing. In addition, participation should be voluntary and anonymous. Questions should also avoid physical and psychological harm to the participants. All measures have been taken to ensure ethical principles have been followed. For example, informed consent will happen when customers arrive for their appointment. They will be asked whether they would like to partake in an online survey. If answered yes, only then will an e-mail containing the survey be sent.", "positive": ", Hope you are well.

{"id": "aug_567", "anchor": "Autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD) is a polygenic-neurodevelopmental-disorder characterised by three subsets of-deficits: social-impairments, communication impairments-and-repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a-minimum-of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American-Psychiatric-Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). The big 3 theories that attempt to explain the ASD profile are Theory of Mind (TOM), Executive Function Theory (EFT) and Weak Central Coherence (WCC), they are higher level theories as they focus on developmental differences in cognition rather than at a perceptual level. TOM looks at the ability to attribute mental-states to others as-well as yourself. A deficit of this ability in the ASD population is widely notarised in research tasks such as the Sally Ann and the Unexpected Contents tasks which was passed by around 20% of ASD-individuals compared to 86-96% in a neurotypical population (Baron-Cohen-et-al, 1985;Perner-et-al, 1989). Evidence of differences regarding TOM are also found in neuro-studies measuring brain activity, a study conducted by White et al, (2014) found ASD children showed similar atypical neuro-activity as non-ASD children with historical mentalizing-deficits. TOM is strong at explaining social impairments such as lack of shared enjoyment, socio-emotional reciprocity and also some communication-issues such as not picking up subtle cues in conversation (Kimhi, 2014). Overall, TOM suffers from two main limitations, even with differences in brain activity of core-TOM regions, it cannot explain social deficits completely as 20% still pass those tests mentioned and secondly, it fails to account one third of the ASD diagnostic triad: repetitive activities. On the other hand, EFT-is-concerned with-our-minds-attentional system, spatially located in the brains frontal lobes. It-is-based-specifically-on-the ability of novel idea generation, response inhibition, planning and cognitive flexibility (Diamond, 2012). The EFT attempts to explain ASD deficits both social and non-social, successfully in tasks such as the Wisconsin-Card-Sorting-Test, where cognitive flexibility-is-required-to-follow-different card-rules-linearly and ASD-individuals show lack of flexibility and high amounts of perseverative errors in set shifting, instead adhering to repetition of the old rule . A meta-analysis by Landry &amp; Al-Taie (2016) covering this topic spanned 30 years and found effect sizes of 0.30-0.74; all studies statistically significant. Furthermore, EFT attempts to explain other ASD behaviours such as lack of inhibition of prepotent-response which executive-functioning manages (Levy, 2007). Although this has mixed evidence, a study by Adams &amp; Jarrold (2012) showed ASD individuals have a deficit in distractor-inhibition related to perceptual processing rather than the prepotent response due to executive functioning. Last of the big 3, WCC, is explained in an updated model by Happe &amp; Frith (2006), describing ASD as an imbalance in data integration and a bias toward local elements over global rather than a deficit. This difference in processing style is strong at explaining issues with emotion recognition in faces, Lahaie et al (2006), found those with ASD could be primed toward arbitrary segments of the face as much as toward intuitive parts like the mouthnose. This bias-towards local elements is supported by Gross (2004) who-reported ASD individuals showing atypical patterns due to focusing on the lower regions of the face instead of the whole, this explains well issues of emotion recognition due to failure to process the whole face. The WCC\u2019s ability to explain restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) has also found support by Chen et al (2008) who found RRB associations with a detailed-focused processing style. Lastly, the WCC helps understanding the benefits having ASD-provides which neither of the other theories presented, such as better performance on embedded figures and block design tasks due to them requiring you to look for local elements that make-up the global (Shah-&amp;-Frith, 1983;1993). Conclusively, this short essay has attempted to weigh the ability of the big-3 theories in explaining the full clinical profile of ASD, the research shows none are able to. Either having mixed evidence in some areas or failing to account aspects of the profile entirely and even suffering from domain specificity, research found false-belief deficits in TOM only affected ASD individuals when the task was completed mentally vs. visual checks of physical differences (Perner &amp; Leekam, 2008). However, over time they can be developed further like the Empathising and Systemizing theory which attempts to build on TOM and explain non-social aspects (Baron-Cohen, 2009). Most importantly,-there is a positive to theories being independent to a restrictive global picture, ASD is multi-faceted and forcing a single picture is-unlikely to be representative-of everyone. Instead, is the idea of-fractionation, it shows the likelier picture of different theories being able to explain the-different domains-of the same impairments and the whole clinical profile being accounted for (Brunsdon-&amp;-Happe, 2013). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by 3 subsets of deficits: social impairments, communication impairments and repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a minimum of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). Lower-level processes such as percept of sensory modalities which are extremely important in those with ASD. Many aspects can be explained by the theory of Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) and it itself is an alternative to the WCC, the EPF focusses on difference in perceptual processing vs. WCC which focuses entirely on higher level cognitive processing instead. The EPF has a very broad range of research covering research on many different atypical behaviours in ASD, one being enhanced abilities in embedded figures, block-design and visual search tasks (Mottron &amp; Burack , 2001). These findings have mixed backings in research, it is supported by research on inhibition of prepotent responses which found Perceptual distractors were more inhibiting than prepotent responses (Adams &amp; Jarrold, 2011). Conversely, disputing evidence by Kaldy et al (2016) agreed with the idea that ASD individuals are better at these tasks but argue that it is instead due to deficitsdifferences in attentional networks. Explained due to behaviours in ASD such as overfocusing due to fixationpreoccupation in tasks and-restricted-interests which enable individuals to perform better in detail focused tasks. Nevertheless, the idea of enhanced percept is highly important in explaining savant skills as an example, where access to raw, less-processed information is manipulated for the benefit of ASD individuals, the EPF states savant skills deeply rooted by perceptual elements e.g. in drawingmusic (Motron et al, 2009). This co-aligns well with the fact that around 95% of ASD individuals experience sensory symptoms due to a perceptual differences both positive and negative (Tomchek &amp; Dunn, 2007), but explanations for hyposensitivity are still awry. Another explanation of atypical ASD behaviour is the social motivation theory by Chevallier (2012), it attempts to explain social deficits, specifically why there are social impairments. It concluded that due to lack of social interest, ASD children miss out on key opportunities to develop social skills and are socially impaired as a result. This is supported by Fletcher-Watson (2009) who found that when given a hybrid image of both social and non-social areas, those with ASD spend equal time in both and are less likely to have their first fixation on the social area. However, there is research that argues a stark contrast, instead in the favour of perceptual load. Research on object personification in ASD, found significant amounts of loneliness and object personification and reported an ASD need to personify objects as to alleviate social disconnection and isolation (White &amp; Remington, 2018). If ASD individuals do have social interest, then why are they socially impaired? Research on face-to-face interference by Riby et al (2012), found individuals with ASD when asked to maintain hold gaze had worse task performance, these findings lead to the idea that those with ASD are perceptually overloaded in social situations like holding gaze. Cyclically back to the inference from social motivation theory, those with ASD therefore avoid social situations in order to not feel overloaded. Both theories are able to successfully reason both socialcommunicative impairments and lend the idea that in the absence of social experience, ASD individuals are caught up in preoccupated behaviour. It\u2019s clear from this that there is a lot of research on ASD on both lower and higher level processes, and both equally can explain atypical behaviours shown in ASD individuals whether it by lack of developed social skills due to perceptual capacity or be social impairments due to deficits of TOMEFT. The fact remains that none of these theories can explain with unyielding evidence the full clinical profile of ASD and every atypical behaviours described (Mottron et al, 2006; Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). For example, albeit the mixed evidence, the EPF theory can successfully reason repetitive activities and some social impairments but can be outdone on the latter by TOM. However, regardless of which is correct, having a multi-faceted evidence base is a positive, it enables us to look at all angles of ASD rather than forcing a singular theory to explain all dimensions. Furthermore, doing so has led to good outcomes, such as revised updates to theories for their shortcomings such as the updated EPF theory by Mottron et al (2006),which added in the novel idea that higher order processing can be an optional pathway for those with ASD.", "positive": "\ufffd\ud83d\ude2d Fml i got uni stress already I cant think hungry either Bro idk i dont leave my house \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I been in the outside 3 times since new years Saw a post saying boris might reverse lockdown lift Cz South African corona variant Idk if its tru tho Was on ig I can enjoy next couple years Suit shopping?\ud83d\ude2d Nd same suit both days im confusion Why ther two days But dont wanna ask Can pls ask why thers two days Itll sound normal \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Blessings upon u Days aint even together They like 4 days apart Everyone taking day off work for this?", "positive_attacked": "\ufffd\ud83d\ude2d Fml i got uni stress already I cant think hungry either Bro idk i dont leave my house \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I been in the outside 3 times since new years Saw a post saying boris might reverse lockdown lift Cz South African corona variant Idk if its tru tho Was on ig I can enjoy next couple years Suit shopping?\ud83d\ude2d Nd same suit both days im confusion Why ther two days But dont wanna ask Can pls ask why thers two days Itll sound normal \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Blessings upon u Days aint even together They like 4 days apart Everyone taking day off work for this?", "label": 1}

All these participants volunteered to take part. Design: The design was a 3x2 mixed ANOVA with 3 between subjects being the different age categories; [young], [young, old] and [old, old] and 2 within subjects being the recognition tasks given to participants; single and dual task. The independent variable for this study is the age and recognition task. The dependent variable is the response time recognition memory (1 Hz). Materials: The materials used was the Toronto word pool (http:euclid.psych.yorku.cashinyTWP) to generate the word displayed and also an online metronome clicker Procedure: A 30-word list was presented to participants by using the Toronto word pool which is used to generate the words that the participants see. This was followed by a word recognition task where the previous words were presented with a set of new words that were not seen before in single and dual task conditions. This list was repeated 4 times but between each study the participant completed a mental arithmetic task. Participants in the single task condition were then asked to recall the first word list that was presented to them. Participants in the dual task condition followed the same process of recalling list of words presented to them whilst taking part in recognition tasks however also had to take part in a finger tapping task requiring the participant to tap their finger during the study. This required participants to tap their finger to the rhythm of the metronome clicker which clicked once per second. For the older participants, to reduce systematic errors, a Latin square response was used in order to help correct any false recognition which is when participants keep pressing \u2018yes\u2019 even when incorrect.

{"id": "aug_574", "anchor": "Thank you for visiting. Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders? To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee\u2019s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work. Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders? To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant\u2019s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC. Procedural requirements Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline. If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is \u00a352,000, any award exceeding \u00a325,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal. I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed. Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute. If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim? You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects, as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder\u2019s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. WDC Prospect It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee\u2019s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover. In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks\u2019 notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks\u2019 notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks\u2019 worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. UDC Prospect It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal\u2019s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. Applying this, WW may use \u2018other substantial reason,\u2019 ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be \u2018misconduct,\u2019 regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years. Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option? Please find below a list of options available to you. Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder\u2019s behaviour. Advantages: \u2022 You continue to have a regular job and income. \u2022 No stress about finding alternative work. \u2022 Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. Disadvantage: \u2022 Narinder\u2019s disrespectful behaviour may not change. \u2022 The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder\u2019s behaviour. Advantages: \u2022 Same as Option 1. \u2022 WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder\u2019s behaviour. \u2022 WW may assign you a new line manager. Disadvantage: \u2022 Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. Advantages: \u2022 Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. Disadvantage: \u2022 Same as Options 1-2. Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. Advantages: \u2022 You will be free from Narinder\u2019s treatment. \u2022 You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them. \u2022 You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. Disadvantages: \u2022 You will be unemployed after your notice period. \u2022 Stressful finding another job. Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC. Advantages: \u2022 You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. \u2022 You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour. \u2022 Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity. Disadvantages: \u2022 Same as Option 4. \u2022 There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim? WDC The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks\u2019 worth salary (\u00a310,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately \u00a34,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (\u00a31,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your \u2018Christmas [bonus]\u2019 regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual \u2018right[s] to receive.\u2019 Currently, you have taken two days\u2019 leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days\u2019 worth salary (\u00a33,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. Your compensation totals \u00a319,263.96. This includes notice salary (\u00a310,000), Pension (\u00a34,000), untaken leave (\u00a33,703.96) and Christmas bonus (\u00a31,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals \u00a317,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals \u00a311,763.96 or \u00a310,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal\u2019s maximum award of \u00a325,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. UDC The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. Basic Award Tribunal will award you \u00a36,300 based on your weekly gross salary (\u00a3525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. Compensatory Award The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (\u00a378,000), as it is below \u00a386,444 cap. This may be lower (\u00a325,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job. If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (\u00a384,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this. The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. Additional information Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract. Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. Yours Sincerely,", "positive": "r , I hope you\u2019re well.

I am currently looking after my younger sister for the week and time completely ran away with me. I have completed the work for this week and have been coding the interviews for the assignment, I just wanted to check that there wasn\u2019t any important information I missed out on? Again, I am really sorry for missing the seminar. Thank you and I hope you are well, Hi, I was writing as I am looking for some information as to what to do for my abroad placement. I\u2019m feeling quite confused about everything at the moment and just needed some clarity. I have emailed before and I really wanted to do teaching in for my placement. I am aware in the current climate with everything going on this is likely not going to be feasible, however since seeing the placement seminar today, I have seen that it is possible to do study abroad for a term and then placement for the rest of the time. When I go onto and look at the study abroad placements I see that all of them seem to be full term placements? (Unless I\u2019m reading it wrong which could be likely). How would you go about applying for one singular term and then placement for the rest, and would your placement need to be in the same country you do your study abroad in? Another of my queries was to do with credits, as I have seen you are getting assessed whilst on the study abroad programme, is it possible to understand more how that works? I\u2019m sorry for the amount of questions, I just suddenly feel like I should have done a lot more than what I have already and obviously want to get started as soon as possible.

{"id": "aug_583", "anchor": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs \u00a3157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a caf\u00e9. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a caf\u00e9 to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Caf\u00e9 Kluuvikatu 3, caf\u00e9 which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too. Furthermore, i found a live music bar for my CEO to visit, called Storyville, Helsinki. this offers food, alongside live music band, piano room and dance floor which seems very entertaining.", "positive": "I literally would!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23I woke up to my heart beating really fast and I was excited\ud83d\ude02 got fed up of translating everything to and she was in a rush to go somewhere but idk where\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It\u2019s sooo weird because the other day I asked to be my personal photographer \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 And the dream was so accurate Keep note of his appearance in case you bump into him \ud83d\ude02 Yh I really wish it was true.

{"id": "aug_588", "anchor": "Introduction Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. Evaluation of market segment With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this \u2018Under 22\u2019 bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 \u2013 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher\u2019s fairs should focus on the \u2018Under 22\u2019 package as this is most relevant to first year students. Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city. This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success. Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel. Positioning As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost. To identify Car Club\u2019s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers\u2019 initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people. If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of \u00a33.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around \u00a32.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It\u2019s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. Sixt and Avis start at \u00a351 (Sixt 2020) and \u00a360 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of \u00a336day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs. The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club\u2019s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility. In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success. Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team! The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club\u2019s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category. Car Club\u2019s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so. From Car Club\u2019s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham. Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives. Campaign Objectives 1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population) As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham\u2019s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher\u2019s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club\u2019s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention. 2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher\u2019s fairs within the city Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users\u2019 involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming. Push strategy \u2013 Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student\u2019s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise\u2019s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors. Pull strategy \u2013 This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers\u2019 minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness. As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers\u2019 positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion. Marketing tools plan Personal selling Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication \u2026 in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy \u2026 a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers\u2019 presence on campus at fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club\u2019s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use. Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise\u2019s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. Testing Personal sellers\u2019 ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher\u2019s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data. Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments. Advertising Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication \u2026 designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS\u2019 lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that \"77% of students are using Instagram, and 75% are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club\u2019s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students\u2019 social-media usage whilst remaining affordable. Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness. Integration of marketing communications Enterprise\u2019s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 as they are socially active \u2018communaholics\u2019, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide. Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company\u2019s market position and standing by Enterprise\u2019s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service. The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online. Implementation plan Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April \u2013 Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops. Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn\u2019t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "positive": "r , Thank you so much for taking the time to review and make an exception for my placement, I am immensely grateful!

I\u2019ve met with you a couple times previously as you\u2019re my personal tutor, but it\u2019s been a couple years so I\u2019m sorry for not keeping in contact with you. I hope you\u2019re doing well and staying safe! Today I received a grade for one of my modules, and i\u2019ve never felt the need to contest a grade but sadly with this module I do. I pride myself in not getting below a first in all coursework\u2019s, because I generally do better in them than exams... and had set myself the target of graduating with a first this year. The grade I received back today was 50% (2:2) which was disheartening as I tried so hard on this essay, and really enjoyed doing it. It\u2019s also a module that has really interested employers when mentioned, so to have such a low grade worries me. I had to cancel an interview today due to my upset and worry about the impact of this module. The feedback received criticised two things- not talking about myself (where I come from) which we were told to actively avoid so to not be identifiable. Also not exploring my interviewee\u2019s experiences and engaging with theoretical facets instead. However, when looking at the assignment brief, I had discussed everything they wanted, pulling in both theory and information from my interview... and also adding additional sections to provide more information about my interviewee\u2019s culture and behaviour. I wish to get a remark on this essay, because I genuinely feel like I\u2019ve provided everything the brief asked for- and more, and I received a 1st in second year for a module very similar to this one. Could you advise me on how I can get this remarked as I\u2019ve never gone through this process before... I don\u2019t know whether I need to contact the module leader- and I\u2019m quite anxious to do so as I don\u2019t wish to come across as rude. I also don\u2019t wish for there to be conflict (I switched modules this term due to an assessment being debate based and I wanted to avoid that!), but due to the unfamiliarity of this process I do not know how to respectfully approach this issue? I was just extremely disheartened by getting a 50 in a subject I enjoyed so much, and especially in my final year where I\u2019m working so hard to get a first, and my other grades reflect this too.

{"id": "aug_595", "anchor": "Rationale: The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today\u2019s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual\u2019s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual\u2019s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. Results: Discourse 1- negativity of social media Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. Discourse 2- vital for families Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person. Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. Discourse 3- loneliness Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely. Discourse 4- social media not healthy Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved. Discussion: Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely. Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling. The wrong way to do it is by lying or exaggerating on social media just to acquire a specific response or reaction from the people reading it.", "positive": "hh I will just relaxed Yeahh and I spent all of last night doing my assignments so I can rest now Ooh that\u2019s good Do you then start revision and coursework They really haven\u2019t been nice to you at all Aww well done They acc need to take it easy on you guys Awww Are you staying at home with your mum It\u2019s getting better tbh Not as painful Ooh no worries \ud83d\ude02 How was your day?

I am currently in the process of applying for a maintenance loan to support me additionally. My father died when I was young, so I was only in contact with my mother. However, in my mother kicked me out of the house and culturally I have been \"disowned\" by my family. I have been since living temporarily at a relative' house. However, they do not want me to do life with them because of family issues. I am capable to move out and I am looking at student accommodation. I am currently employed part-time and will be when I intend to move into accommodation but the only difficulty I am facing is; every suitable agency requires me to provide a guarantor but this is a problem because I have no one that will allow me to put them down as my guarantor. My friends are not eligible, my family are not supportive of my choices and my work colleagues have not known me for long. Also, I can't pay off the whole rent in one sum for the period but my permanent job at and the support from student finance will allow me to pay the rent every month as the agencies require.

{"id": "aug_610", "anchor": "This strategy paper will focus on suggesting realistic solutions to the problem of educational gender inequality in India. This inequality is a clear problem; unequal access to education is an infringement of human rights. If this gender disparity was lessened, the well-being and development of children would be positively impacted, as well as the economy of the country itself (Fuller, 2019). To tackle this issue, proposed strategies could take the form of implementing new legislative reforms that aid families in the struggles they face, as well as reforming teaching throughout India in order to help eradicate damaging cultural and social norms. The paper will begin by firstly explaining the main problems within the education sector in India and will then highlight the importance of achieving gender equality in education. The main body of the paper will entail a detailed analysis of the current strategies and legislation in place as well as non-governmental reforms made by different organisations. The paper will then move towards a focus on the suggested strategies that could be incorporated into the current education system to alleviate gender inequalities and will be compared to the successes of educational reform in Sweden. This will include a description of the targets for the reforms, instruments to aid reform, and the target groups at which reforms are aimed at. The paper will conclude with a summary of the findings from this research and ways to ensure the successful implementation of new strategies. Why is this a problem? There are two primary factors that can limit the education of girls in India: cultural traditions and poverty. In terms of cultural traditions, there are several reasons that this issue can play a significant role in the educational disparity between genders. Firstly, the miseducation of parents about the importance of schools for girls and the costings of education itself thus leads to families becoming reluctant to educate girls within the household. Research shows that parents are more willing to send their girls to school if they had access to more information about school (Maertens, 2011). Furthermore, it is said that gender discrimination within household expenditure and education has resulted in the inadequate progress of educating of women in many countries across the world, and thus ingrains this issue into the societal framework of such countries (Saha, 2013). This is also reinforced by the low literacy rates in India. The correlation between low literacy rates among men and women indicates that the miseducation of parents can affect the education of girls because they themselves have had inadequate education, and it is difficult for them to understand the importance of it, further highlighting the gender inequalities between men and women through previous social norms. For example, the 2011 literacy rates of women were 57.93% compared to men which were 77.15% (Pathania, 2020) demonstrating gender disparities and how poverty can be a factor in gender inequalities within education. Poverty plays an important role in the lack of education for girls. Daughters from families that face social pressures to get married are more likely to only complete minimum education, as shown in a study of three rural villages in India, where only 39% of girls were allowed by their parents to pursue higher education, compared to the 71% of boys who would go into further education (Maertens, 2013). Furthermore, educating women is not prioritised in the household as it stops the income that would otherwise be earned from girls going straight into work rather than staying in school. Therefore, working and earning can be seen to be put on a pedestal instead for the many families facing financial difficulties (Hebert, 2020). Why is this an important issue for gender equality? As UNICEF has stated, the educational advancement of girls is the most effective way of combatting challenges to human development, so it is important to expand educational access and overcome cultural norms to achieve this (Ross, Shah &amp; Wang, 2011). Inequalities within education are important to the issue of gender equality, as even though India emerges as one of the top three countries for higher education (Bazaz &amp; Akram, 2020), in certain states such as Uttar Pradesh, only 33.20% of women are educated compared to the 73.40% of men who are educated, highlighting that there are severe problems within the education system that disadvantage women. Furthermore, this can lead to other problems such as a gender gap in the labour market, as if employers value a woman\u2019s education less than that of a man\u2019s, and therefore there are fewer economic incentives to educate women, which subsequently affects the economy and the wellbeing of women (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Another factor that makes this issue important is that the education of girls further reduces the risks they face, such as abuse and child marriage, as currently, a third of child brides worldwide are in India (Sahni, 2018). Moreover, better education for girls reduces the risks of child labour in poorer families to ensure the survival of their households, as the hourly wages of a child with higher school education are 8.97% higher compared to a child with no schooling, leading to less exploitation (Chamarbagwala, 2008). Attempted strategies to achieve gender equality in education There have been many attempts in India to close the gender gaps in education, through both legal and social means. The main legislative reform introduced was the Right to Education Act in 2009, in which, all children between 6 and 14 years of age are required to complete primary school education. This reform has proven successful as enrolment between 2013-14 increased from 43.8% to 48.2% (Sahni, 2018). However, its success still proves limited on the gender equality front as a UNESCO report detailed that of the 95% of children who attended primary school, only 40% continued onto secondary education, in which, a small fraction of the 40% were girls (Modi, 2017). Attempts have also been made to reform the curriculum. However, this failed due to the response of disadvantaged schools towards the issue of gender equality: an attempt was made to create a new system where boys of different abilities were paired with girls, but this meant the educational interests of girls were sacrificed, therefore showing little to no development in changing gender inequalities in schools (Charlton, 2007). Secondly, a non-legislative reform that was made to combat gender inequality in education was the KGBV programme introduced in 2004. The goal of the programme was to increase children\u2019s, and in particular girls, access to the curriculum and to improve teaching standards. This began successfully as two Indian states partnered with CARE India (a non-governmental organisation) to introduce KGBV schools that were single-sex and employ a non-traditional curriculum. The KGBV school initiative was shown to be successful as they were more inclusive than state schools, as children of all castes could attend, which also allowed the new schools challenged harmful social norms. However, the success was limited as the KGBV programme did not focus on education above seventh grade where school dropout rates for girls are the highest (Shah, 2015). Finally, the most successful attempt at improving gender inequality in education was by ANK, a non-profit organisation with an aim to empower girls. ANK set up in 10 rural villages and introduced several initiatives for girls including: bicycle banks in 2002 to improve access to schools for girls, a life skills education programme out of school hours, a scholarship programme, and a karate programme. The implementation of these programmes showed great promise as 1,100 girls achieved a scholarship and 1,000 girls were given access to bikes. It was found that the combination of the bicycle bank and the life skills education programme led to the best education outcomes for girls. However, the bicycle bank programme was discontinued and this programme only reached a small number of girls, so, nationally, gender disparities remained high (Modi, 2017). Proposed Strategies My first proposed strategy is to subsidise costs for school by 50% for low-income families; as mentioned above, many parents selectively choose their male children to attend school rather than their female children, because of financial difficulties. Therefore, subsidising the costs of schooling can enable equal opportunities for girls. This has proved successful in countries such as Sweden, where pre-schooling costs have been subsidised for lower-income families, in order to equalise opportunities for all and ensure substantial educational attainment for both males and females (Bjorklund, Clark, Edin, Fredricksson &amp; Krueger, 2006). Success can be seen clearly when compared to India, a large 79% of the students go on to secondary school in Sweden (European Commission, 2017) against a mere 40% in India, in which, the ratio of boys to girls is equal in Sweden unlike in India (Modi, 2017). Additionally, another legislative reform that could be introduced is to improve families\u2019 access to daycare and after school care, so that parents can work, alleviating any stresses on children providing additional household income. A similar policy proved successful in Sweden (Sweden, 2020), in which a right to daycare was introduced in the 1990s for working parents to alleviate financial pressure (Fritzell, Hvinden, Kautto, Kvist &amp; Uusitalo, 2001). Furthermore, there has been evidence to suggest that altering the way teachers are trained helps to promote gender equality and eradicate bias in the classroom. In a proposed system called REFLECT, teachers are given criteria that they must meet, including creating a suitable learning environment for female and male children - this could prove beneficial in India (Kollmayer, 2020). The next proposed strategy is an extension of the work of ANK with the bicycle banks and life skills education programme (Modi, 2017) as it proved successful but stopped due to a lack of funding. This would enable a focus on the education of girls and give them access to adequate teaching, which in turn reaps enormous benefits economically, socially, and mentally, especially in terms of the wellbeing of girls in India. It would also help to elevate the goal of India to become more gender-inclusive, as currently, their progress for gender equality remains slow and they stand at a ranking of 132 out of 187 countries (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Sequentially, to enable parents of girls to realise the importance of education, it is vital to recruit them as allies in the movement against gender inequalities in education. To do this, parents\u2019 evenings could be introduced for teachers to educate parents in schooling and other matters that put girls at risk such as child marriage. Research shows that parents evenings are important in the development of a child and important for the parents themselves as they are responsible for making key decisions that impact the future of their children (Fefer, 2020), highlighting how this can also be a way to communicate the positive prospects for girls with the aid of education. To conclude, it is prevalent that actions must be taken within education legislation and within the households of girls to combat the problem of gender inequality within education. The government must take steps to support families of lower incomes so as to ensure no one is denied equal opportunity to education. This will reduce child labour rates, increase literacy rates, and improve India\u2019s ranking on the gender equality index, as well as increasing the economic status of many civilians in India. With the increased education of girls, it will help to combat harmful social norms in the future, preventing young girls from the fate of child marriage, abuse, and exploitation. With reforms in teaching, they could allow for long-lasting changes within education, as it means they can be the main drivers for change within schools. This, combined with the added aid of regular parents\u2019 evenings, allows for teachers to become catalysts in changing negative social attitudes towards gender equality concerns that strategies like these will remain only partially effective. For example, India was one of 52 countries that refused to comply with Article 5 of the UN sustainable development goals which states that \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" (United Nations, 2020). Without the support of the government, gender equality may not be valued. However, this can be counteracted by the implementation and enforcement of new laws, starting within the education sector, to allow women and young girls to become more independent and assert themselves within society.", "positive": "Hi Helen, I have prepared some research for you regarding the itinerary for your trip to Helsinki in September.

{"id": "aug_613", "anchor": "Introduction In order to analyse to what extent English law\u2019s approach to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith is satisfactory, it important to understand that the fundamental attitude towards good faith and the recent developments in good faith, that lead to a paradox within the law. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd , Lord Bingham defined what good faith is synonymic to, which was \"playing fair\", \"coming clean\" or \"putting one\u2019s card face upwards on the table\". This approach has been embodied by most countries outside the common law world, whereby, there is an overriding principle of good faith. However, English law, tends to abide by a piecemeal technique, which means good faith is applied as and when it is needed, rather than a general law. Nonetheless, the courts have more recently signalled a departure from such approach, as it has become increasingly more common for courts to uphold the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, and in doing so, have caused a level of uncertainty within the law. This essay will argue that the approach Courts have taken to enforce promises to negotiate in good faith is in fact unsatisfactory. This essay develops, first, by explaining the general obligations of good faith and the traditional hostility towards it. Secondly, it will focus specifically on the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith and, whether, in fact, this has been enforceable. Finally, it will be explained that, despite the attempts to define what the Courts will uphold in relation to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate, it inevitably leads to courts being too involved in commercial business and therefore, undermines the commercial stability that England places on high importance. Traditional Views Towards Good Faith Historically, hostility towards the doctrine of good faith has been prevalent in English law. Traditionally, English law develops piecemeal solution in response to the specific problems they are faced with, rather than an imposing an overriding principle of good faith. The reasoning, for this, is it creates too much uncertainty and subjectivity, but arguably, more importantly, it allows for freedom of contract and party of autonomy. As put by, Sir Roy Goode \"in what we like to think \u2013 perhaps wrongly \u2013 is the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice. It is necessary in a commercial setting that businessmen at least should know where they stand.\" Thus, indicating, why the original approach to good faith, is satisfactory because it leads to commercial certainty, which is ingrained into English law. This is fundamental to the core, further evidenced, by the fact \"the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice.\" Conversely, this certainty that is placed on such high importance in English law, is being undermined by the exceptions where English law does recognise good faith, one of them being express promises to negotiate in good faith. Thus, meaning it is enforceable in courts. Many of these express terms to negotiate are based on the perception that both parties will be entering a joint venture, as there would be an intention to create a long term relation and parties may set out commitments for a specific time. The declarations made in the House of Lords decisions of HIH Casualty v Chase Manhattan Bank , Lord Hoffman observes that it goes without saying that underlying the contractual arrangement of the parties there will be a common assumption that the parties involved will behave honestly. Although, there may be express terms to negotiate in good faith, the nature of these relationships alone, should call for honest, open and fair dealing. This is considered to be a relational contract. Leggatt LJ explains that communication and co-operation is based on trust and loyalty might be crucial and impliedly expected by the parties, even if not expressly stated in contract. However, there is an issue with this definition as it has been criticised for a lack of explanation, as put by Severine Saintier, Leggatt J does not elaborate as to what relational contracts are precisely, why they require such enhanced good faithloyalty or what this would entail, which is regrettable. Such criticism simply strengthens the Court\u2019s previously hostile approach to the doctrine; due to the ambiguity in interpretation of the doctrine as there are no guidelines as to how the Court is to identify \"good faith\", and so is often done so subjectively. Express Promises To Negotiate In Good Faith Nevertheless, express terms to promise to negotiate in good faith, has been favoured and welcomed; due to the flexibility and adaptability it allows for within the contract. The freedom of inserting an article that mandates a negotiation, means that parties are able to prepare themselves for future, as the future is uncertain, they are unable to dictate what the commercial environment may look like in 20 years. For instance, events, such as a recession or a plummet in the market by including a term that opens the door for renegotiations in relation to the specific term. Cases, such as Petromec , the clause was 12.4 , where it states that \u2018 Brasoil agrees to negotiate in good faith with Petromc the extra costs..\u2019 This term emphasises why parties may include an express term in the contract for future insulation against potential risks that may occur. Enforceability of Promises to Negotiate through Development of Law. Case law paves the way for the enforceability of contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, by refining the scope of good faith. Walford v Miles, the case was as follows, the business owner promised the plaintiffs that it would terminate negotiations to sell business to third party, however, the business owner then sold the business to a third party. The plaintiffs argued that the business owner had a duty to negotiate in good faith. However, it was held that the promise to negotiate was unenforceable. Lord Ackner to be \"unworkable\" and \"inherently repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in negotiations.\" It is imperative for distinctions to be made between a good faith duty which governs pre \u2013 contractual relations and of those that concern a contractual performance, as well as the contrast between terms that are expressly codified for the intrusion of a duty of good faith. In light of this intricacy, Longmore LJ took on the role of understanding the criticisms that the courts have had with upholding a promise to negotiate, he pointed out three main arguments; one of them being that the obligation is an agreement to agree and this is too uncertain to enforce.. However, he dismissed this argument by stating that is carries little weight because the obligation on the facts was an express obligation in a contract that was otherwise enforceable. By arguing, these main points Longmore LJ has narrowed the vagueness, and this is best shown in the comparison of Walford v Miles and Petromec Inc v Petroleo, in the Walford case the contract was still to come into the effect of the good faith arrangement as it was still in the pre \u2013 negotiation stage, the contract was never concluded. However, in Petromec, it was clear that it was not just a bare agreement to negotiation, as it was a complex contract drafted by their lawyers. This case, is a crucial turning point in relation to promises to negotiate in good faith, as it maintains party autonomy and freedom of contract, which as mentioned is fundamental to Englands commercial environment, therefore, allows for a consistent and coherent standard of how express terms are upheld by the courts. The Quota To Satisfy Shaker v Visajet, was yet another case that was consistent with the way the Courts uphold express promises to negotiate in good faith. In this case, there was a promise to \u2018proceed in good faith\u2019 as well as \u2018use reasonable endeavours\u2019 to agree a documentation pursuant to the purchase of an aircraft. Teare J stated that there was no binding legal obligation based on the promise. The reason for this was because there was \u2018no objective criteria\u2019, that the court was able to decide whether the party acted unreasonably. This further enhances the distinction using Petromec , because in the case, there was sufficient objective criteria to make the promise enforceable. However, Shaker, meant that the courts devised a test in order to see if the express promises to negotiate is enforceable; the test requires two questions to be satisfied. The first criteria to meet is, \u2018is there a certainty of object?\u2019, this relates to clarity in what the negotiation was set out to achieve e.g. responding to a change in the circumstances. The second is \u2018 are there sufficient objective criteria to determine what a good faith negotiation looks like in the context of this particular contract?\u2019 This criteria relates to the idea that the Courts should be able to look at the contract and have the exact information to uncover, what the negotiation should look like in good faith. These cases all draw to the same conclusion that promises to negotiate in good faith should be upheld and is attempted to be done so by the Courts by using precedence, the courts should not avoid enforceability due to some vagueness, on how the term is to be upheld in practical contexts. Upholding the contract leading too much involvement Parties requiring terms to be upheld and enforced necessitates a court to work out what a good faith negotiation looks like in that contract, in fact it is vital to do so, because it is the only way to conclude if there has been a breach or not. There is too much vagueness surrounding the good faith negotiation, which inevitably leads to the Courts having to fill in the blanks, in essence leading them to \u2018make\u2019 the contracts for the parties. In fact, this interpretation is considered to take up more judicial time than all other areas of the law of contract put together. Although, Lord Hoffman came up with five principles governing how the courts should interpret written contracts, there was a lot of backlash for this as it was \u2018It was said to generate uncertainty because it appeared to widen the circumstances in which the judges could depart from the \u2018natural and ordinary meaning\u2019 of the words used by the parties.\u2019 The underlying issue is that, regardless, of how precise the terms are, it will inevitably lead to courts getting too involved in interpreting the contract and assuming what the parties meant instead of what they actually wrote. This in turn generates too much uncertainty and threatens the stability of the commercial environment. Alternatives to solve uncertainty Although, a common option for both parties is to include an arbitration, which is an alternate way of settling a dispute outside of courts, however, this has been criticised because the existence of the arbitration obligation specifically incorporated into clause itself indicates strongly that the parties were not intending to retain their freedom to agree or disagree according to their perceived interests. More importantly, as highlighted in the Emirates Trading and Associated British Ports, it leads to satellite litigation, meaning the parties go to Court arguing about not the specific breach of the contract but a separate matter arising from this, in the Emirates Trading case, it was about whether the good faith negotiation term was in fact enforceable. Satellite litigation is undesirable and in fact takes up the Courts resources and arguably, \"tends not to help with either expedition or the saving of expense and perhaps more than anything leads to disproportionality.\" Ironically, the very reason why the express promise to negotiate was avoid long-drawn-out dispute and going to court by resolving them through friendly discussions of good faith. Thus, indicating that going to court may lead to better solutions for the parties, simultaneously, altering the position and standpoint of the traditional view held by the English courts. Conclusion To conclude, express promises to negotiate in good faith is upholding, although it has been consistent and the requirements have been made unambiguous through case law and the enforceability by the Courts have also been constant, aiding the reliability and validity. However, the issue with the Court enforcing the express terms is that, they have to work out the good faith in the negotiation, but by doing this it means that the courts are at high risk of making the parties contracts for them. This creates the worry that the commercial stability in England would be threatened because it means party autonomy is not at the priority, as well, as freedom of contract. Both of these element are considered to be central to the English law, in relation to commercial law.", "positive": "lo, Unfortunately, I lost the previous email, so again I am unsure on who to address the letter to.

{"id": "aug_622", "anchor": "Mandler\u2019s model of the adult semantic system is an explanation of concept development that discusses three claims. Firstly, the fundamental distinction between the core categories; animals\u2019 vs non-animals, secondly; the system is organised hierarchically, and finally, the system is categorically organised from its inception. This essay will evaluate the evidence supporting and disputing Mandler\u2019s second and third claims, with emphasis on the latter in attempt to understand adult cognitive functions. Beginning with the third claim; the semantic system is categorically organised from its inception. Habituation paradigms have been used to examine this implication, using very young infants to investigate distinctions between biological and non-biological motions. Research (Bertenthal et al., 1987) (Simion, Regolin, &amp; Bulf, 2008) has demonstrated young infants\u2019 sensitivity and ability to distinguish between the two motions, therefore suggesting an innate predisposition for this ability, and have highlighted how this distinction is made before language acquisition. Therefore, supporting Mandler\u2019s third claim, whilst also providing supporting evidence for Mandler\u2019s first claim; that distinctions are made animals vs non-animals. The convergence of evidence supports the validity of the conclusions made. However, such research can be criticised in respects to the validity of the methodology. Habituation techniques rely on reengagement of attention when presented with a new stimulus. The result of the young infants\u2019 habituation and dishabituation may be caused by a perceptual difference, not a conceptual one. A view supported by Sloutsky (2003) who argued infants are good at detecting perceptual similarity but do not have conceptual understanding. When investigating the categorical organisation of the semantic system, habituation paradigms fail to answer at what point this process begins, which challenges Mandler\u2019s third claim, consequently presenting an argument that categorical organisation does not begin as early as Mandler perhaps suggests. Therefore, we can ask, at what point does this early category organisation begin. To examine this, we must look at Mandler\u2019s second claim; the system is organised hierarchically. There is much debate regarding which depiction of early category organisations is more accurate. There are two main hypothesises which debate the hierarchical organisation. Rosch (1978) argues a basic-level hypothesis, and suggests we learn concepts in a bottom-up order. The basic-level is the first conceptual level, it focuses on within-category similarity and between-category dissimilarity. Later in development, the superordinate-level emerges and following that, the subordinate-level. The basic-level occupies a privileged position in the hierarchy in semantic cognition (Rosch, 1978), (Bauer &amp; Just, 2017). Supporting experimental research (Daehler, Lonardo &amp; Bukatko 1979) has found infants made basic-level matches more easily than superordinate ones, and case study research (Clark, 1973) has found children\u2019s first words for objects are often basic-level. The triangulation of methods used across the research supporting the basic-level hypothesis suggests consistency across findings and validates their conclusions. That said, this theory cannot explain the linguistic biases children may be influenced by; when adults label stimuli for children, it is often at the basic-level i.e. adults are more likely use the label \u2018bed\u2019 rather than furniture (superordinate-level) or sofa bed (subordinate). This infers that such organisation is possibly guided through linguistic influences and not through bottom up processing as thought. On the contrary, Mandler has provided an alternative depiction of early category taxonomies; the global-conceptions hypothesis. Using a top-down approach, claims an infant\u2019s first conceptual categories are not at the basic-level, but at a global level which resemble superordinate domains, however there are no basic-level classes within them. Supported through her experimental research using object examination tasks (Mandler &amp; MacDonough 1993), it was found superordinate distinctions were made (animals vs vehicles) in young infants but basic-level contrasts were not (dog vs fish). A criticism regarding the validity of this research is made by Jones &amp; Smith (1993) who argue for the importance of perceptually rich stimuli to be used in concept developmental studies. Real dogs and real fish obtain different features to that of a toy version, i.e. smells, textures and sizes. This research lacks mundane realism. Therefore, assuming the distinctions cannot be made between the basic-level contrast is arguably invalid. It is also important to state how negative results for a basic-level hypothesis does not create positive results for the global-conceptions hypothesis. Reflecting upon the research presented, there is no clear answer to which hypothesis is correct; both present insightful explanations into early categorical organisation and adult cognitive functioning. Neither hypothesis however address the issue regarding perceptual vs conceptual organisation; do infants and children have a conceptual understanding of stimuli or can they just acknowledge their perceptual differences. Further critiquing Mandler\u2019s third claim in regard to the implication of early categorical organisation being prior to language acquisition. Asking at which point language interferes with conceptual organisation may provide an answer to when we are able to distinguish between perceptual differences and conceptual understanding. The role of perceptual similarity in categorisation has been investigated by Gelman and Coley (1990) who used typical and atypical category members and looked at the influence of linguistic support upon the judgements made by 2-year olds. They found appearance controls judgement about category membership in absence of linguistic support in young children, however when provided with labels, category membership rather than perceptual appearance guides the interferences about category properties. From this, we can assume older infants obtain a conceptual understanding regardless of perceptual inferences due to linguistic guidance. An important factor of this research is challenging prototypicality of categories, and the influences it has upon children in their conceptual development when organising. It could be argued that prototypicality of prior research into early categorisation may disguise children\u2019s distinctions between perception and conception, suggesting the ability to distinguish may be sooner than this research indicates, supporting Mandler\u2019s third claim. In conclusion, this essay suggests the research evidence into concept development has greatly contributed to understanding adults cognitive functioning. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding at which stage infants can truly distinguish between conceptual understanding and perceptual differences. One weakness of this evaluation is the research discussed only considers that of typical development and ignores atypical developmental outcomes.", "positive": ", Thank you so much!

We also live next to my grandparents, and I want to help them where possible too. So I don't really see myself moving. The main reason I want to get back to me is because they seem to encourage a healthy lifestyle. Whereas, at , I could see myself sitting in the car for a long time commuting, being sat in an office for a lot of the day and not much choice for healthy eatingany exercise. I couldn't go to the gym after a 9 hour day (probably more with driving) and I certainly couldn't go before because that would mean getting barely any sleep. This is a big dilemma for me in those respects. Thanks, . Hello, I didn't really have to have much of a conversation with my mom as both of us know we do not wish to move anywhere. I have contacted through their 'contaxt us' section but have not heard back yet. Failing that I have no idea how else I can get through to them, because they do not have a phone number listed. This is annoying as the longer they take to get back to me the less time I have before I have to give a definite answer. Thanks, . Hello , That would be great. How about some time in the afternoon - about 3? (If that is okay with you \ud83d\ude0a) Thanks, . Hello, I attended the Assessment Center today along with graduates (they were kind enough to let me compete with the graduates as I could not attend the undergraduate day). Following learning about the business, the role and the benefits I would say it is more than desirable for my undergraduate placement year. I feel it went very well and that I was quite good despite the other candidates being graduates. They have said I will hear back within five working days maximum. Although I still do not know the result I'm thinking it could be the best option for me and something I would consider holding out for.

{"id": "aug_646", "anchor": "Subjective Expected Utility theory is a normative theory of decision making (Neumann &amp; Morganstern, 1944; Savage, 1954). There are five axioms of SEU theory, first there is a preference for decisions to be well ordered so between two options, there should be a preference. The second axiom is preferences should be transitive so if summer is preferred over winter and winter over spring then summer should be preferred over autumn. The third axiom is if there is an indifference between two options, the probability of them being chosen is equal. Fourth is if there is a preference for one option over another so A over B, if presented with two outcomes where one is the first choice leads to A and the second to B, the first option should be chosen. The last axiom is no alternative is infinitely better than any other. These axioms must be fulfilled to assign utilities to outcomes so the expected utility in any decision can be maximised. From the five axioms, the principle of transitivity is derived which is having a preference of option x to y and y to z leading to a preference of x to z. However, Tversky\u2019s (1969) found that preferences are not always transitive and therefore goes against the SEUT. To account for the violations of the SEU theory the Prospect theory (Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979) was proposed which explains that decision making is based upon personal gains and loss aversions. Therefore, predicting the potential decision to be chosen is difficult due to the probability of the decision being picked being distorted as probabilities are over weighted. Deviations can also be explained by regret theory which found that large differences are over weighted whilst small differences between outcomes are underweighted. Regret theory is also based upon emotions such as disappointment, rejoicing, regret and elation which are anticipated when a result of a decision is known. How the amount of this emotion does not reflect the difference between outcomes accurately.", "positive": "h let\u2019s do !! u been before? ugh yeah :(( i defo won\u2019t get the burger again i always get it thinking each time it will taste better but it doesn\u2019t yeah i went a few weeks back it\u2019s so so nice loads of stores and food options so if we like it this time we\u2019ll go again at least it\u2019s bigger than too yeah i love burgers generally tho so it\u2019s annoying :(( yeah it\u2019s so pretty i\u2019ll bring my disposable camera you should bring your film camera too yeah is pretty small compared to it", "positive_attacked": "h let\u2019s do !! u been before? ugh yeah :(( i defo won\u2019t get the burger again i always get it thinking each time it will taste better but it doesn\u2019t yeah i went a few weeks back it\u2019s so so nice loads of stores and food options so if we like it this time we\u2019ll go again at least it\u2019s bigger than too yeah i love burgers generally tho so it\u2019s annoying :(( yeah it\u2019s so pretty i\u2019ll bring my disposable camera you should bring your film camera too yeah is pretty small compared to it", "label": 1}
{"id": "aug_647", "anchor": "1. Compare and contrast deductive and inductive reasoning. Use examples to explain. Deductive reasoning involves logical thinking, providing us with the means to determine valid arguments in one\u2019s train of thought. Similarly, inductive reasoning is a way of increasing semantic information through generalisation, allowing us to come to conclusions about whether a statement is true or false. Deductive reasoning is similar to inductive reasoning in that concrete or previously known knowledge affects performance on experimental tasks measuring components of ordinary language. For example, in deductive reasoning, our own beliefs effect the validity of conclusions we make because our world knowledge clouds our judgement. Wilkins, (1928) found participants\u2019 beliefs caused conflict with the validity of syllogisms and as a result, their judgement was poorer. Beliefs effect the interpretation of premises, influencing reasoning and bringing about response bias, therefore affecting the validity of the conclusion made. Similarly, experiments on inductive reasoning show familiar content can remind a person of similar problems they solved in the past. Griggs &amp; Cox, (1982) called this the \u2018Memory Cueing Hypothesis\u2019 \u2013 individuals retrieve similar contexts or situations involving solving a similar problem from their long-term memory, reducing facilitation effects involved in reasoning. Another distinction between these types of reasoning is the certainty involved in making conclusions. In inductive reasoning, there is no certainty that the conclusion made from premises are valid all the time, as validity of conclusions depends on factors such as premises given, intention of the argument or statement, as well as the amount of information available at the time. Contrastingly, deductive reasoning is not dependent on as many variables, and is much more clear-cut and direct. Deductive reasoning allows us to form completely valid conclusions all the time, due to logical systems this type of reasoning follows, such as formulisation. Therefore, the conclusion will follow from the premises with absolute certainty, unlike inductive reasoning. 2. Why do we find Wason\u2019s selection task so difficult? Peter Wason\u2019s selection task is a logic puzzle involving deductive reasoning, heavily influenced by Popper\u2019s hypotheticodeductive method. Participants are presented with four cards and a simple rule, and are asked which cards they need to turn over to see if the rule has been broken. Performance in this task is only 15%, even if participants are asked to falsify the rule, not prove it right. Research suggests concrete content facilitates performance. Cheng &amp; Holyoak (1985) state that humans reason with context-dependent \u2018pragmatic reasoning schemas\u2019, involving knowledge about permissions, obligations and causations. These schemas function to predict and reason in unfamiliar situations. During the selection task, permission schemas are evoked along with a set of rules with familiar information in a given scenario. The corresponding schema matches information required to solve the task, and so permission schema facilitate performance, especially when concrete rather than abstract content is used. Additionally, Wason\u2019s selection task is found difficult when rules cannot be interpreted as a social contract. Cosmides, (1989) found the selection task is facilitated when involving social exchanges derived from his computational theory, specifically tasks requiring the participant to detect a \u2018cheater\u2019 trying to take the benefit without paying the cost of a contract. In the context of the selection task, the participant is detecting a \u2018if P not Q\u2019 card is exposing the cheat. Cheat detection is parallel with familiar realistic situations involving social interaction rather than ambiguous and context-free content. When a selection task uses abstract terms not involving social exchanges, participants find it harder to reason as the situation is unfamiliar and doesn\u2019t entail benefits or losses. This highlights the importance of context in Wason\u2019s selection task \u2013 when context is not given, performance decreases considerably. 3. What are the predictions of \"Subjective Expected Utility\" theory for human decision making. How have deviations been explained? Subjective expected utility theory (SEU), (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944 &amp; Savage, 1954) describes decision making, stating when individuals make decisions, they will act rationally by trying to maximise their expected utility. SEU aims to simplify decision making via 5 axioms (completeness, transitivity, continuity, independence and ranking), which when considered, will maximise expected utility. The transitivity axiom assumes people make choices transitively \u2013 if they prefer A to B and B to C, they should prefer A to C. Tversky, (1969) identified a deviation in this axiom, called \u2018intransitivity of preferences\u2019, stating that humans are, in reality, inconsistent in their preferences of choices due to individual differences in evaluative processes and because preferences vary temporally. Tversky conducted experiments using classic transitive preference scenarios and found participants\u2019 preference ordering was inconsistent to the transitivity axiom. Classic scenarios are not logically compatible with the rationality of human decision making, because variability and individuality of decision making in realistic situations aren\u2019t taken into consideration. The independence axiom states preference of order between two choices with equal outcomes should not be affected by one another, even when a third gamble is involved. In other words, equal outcomes should cancel each-other out. A deviation in this axiom called the \u2018Allais paradox\u2019 (Allais, 1953), states the independence axiom fails to consider feelings like disappointment, as well as the rationality involved in choosing a gamble and potentially getting nothing from it. The Allais paradox states evaluations of gambles cannot be done independently of other gambles, as the independence axiom assumes. These deviations highlight the importance for a newer theory to recognise the influence of rationality, and which involves a psychologically descriptive approach, for example the \u2018multi-attribute utility theory\u2019 which is more able to explain decision making in realistic scenarios where decisions are dependent on many independent variables. 4. Using a specific puzzle or problem of your own choice, write out a plan (including diagram) of how to solve it using a state-action tree. This problem is the \u2018Chicken River Crossing Puzzle\u2019: A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. The task is to find out how the man gets all 3 things to the other side of the river in one piece. The solution to this puzzle is as follows: first, the chicken crosses the river in the boat, and the fox and corn are safe together on the other side. He goes back across, and then takes the fox across the river replacing it with the chicken, which is now on the other side. Since the chicken and corn cannot be left together, he takes the corn in his boat and switches the chicken for the corn, which he takes across and leaves it with the fox. He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time, where all his items are across the river safely. 5. What is \"creativity\" and how can it be assessed? Creativity is defined as one\u2019s ability to generate innovative ideas and solutions, and is seen as a form of intelligence. Creative solutions are seen as valuable and insightful, often solutions that novice individuals may not have come up with themselves; in this regard, creative individuals are seen as experts in their domain, as they hold extensive knowledge giving them the ability to produce innovative and original solutions commonly acknowledged by wider society. Various perspectives aim to assess creativity differently, for example the psychometric approach aims to objectively measure creativity. Creativity has been conceptualised as a form of divergent thinking by Guilford, (1956), which is a style of thinking that can lead to many possible solutions to the same problem. It requires both originality and flexibility. Psychometric tests of creativity include the \u2018Unusual Uses Task\u2019 by Guilford, (1967): the participant\u2019s task is to create alternative uses for a common object. Four dimensions are used to score answers: flexibility, originality, fluency, elaboration. Participant\u2019s demonstrate divergent thinking if they generate unusual yet valuable uses for the object. The \u2018Remote Associates Test\u2019 (RAT) was created by Mednick, (1962), who theorised that creativity involves associating nonidentical concepts which are considered dissimilar. In RATs, respondents are shown stimuli in the form of three words and are asked to identify a word to link them together, for example \"worm shelf end\". Here, the answer is book (book worm, book shelf, book end). Psychometric tests in assessing creativity have produced interesting results, especially the observed link between creativity and intelligence, however these methods often mix creativity and intelligence, or originality and creativity. That is, creative individuals tend to have high IQ, but not all high IQ individuals are creative, consequently decreasing the validity of psychometric tests claiming to assess creativity.", "positive": "e's my notes and draft interview sechdule \ud83d\ude42 Hi , My participant for my research will be a cisgender, heterosexual male.

{"id": "aug_649", "anchor": "Introduction Corruption is evil, but evil disguised multiculturally. It remains concerning that fraudulent conduct has greatly impacted the functioning of many cultural societies and organizations. Virtue ethics affirms that virtues and vices are foundational, and that through morality, one can seek fulfilment via ethical and moral duties. The purpose of this essay is to both discuss and critically analyse these two contradictory concepts in great detail. This paper will begin by commenting upon a truly ancient normative ethical theory with reference to corruptive characteristics of both religious, political, and legal perspectives. It will then progress to critically assess the scrutiny put forth by theorists who seek to challenge, not destroy, the legitimacy of Virtue ethics against the dominant material pressures of the 21st century. Finally, this essay will conclude by summarizing the overall position that such \u2018abstractions of goodness\u2019 cannot solely guide one\u2019s morality in a society where unruly methods are used to achieve happiness, and sometimes, with no penalties nor repercussions. Origins: Aristotle and Virtue Ethics One key philosopher who significantly contributed to the development of Virtue ethics is Aristotle. He asserts that to achieve the highest ideal of happiness, one must develop pure virtues and live between excess and deficiency in order to seek the Golden Mean. To become a moral being, morality must be exercised in one\u2019s daily life. To live morally is to live spontaneously and to achieve this, virtues must be developed in order to become a better being. By abstaining from pleasures, this can truly form a moral man. One must live in greatness; in a form that reflects their worth. Should they be dishonest and corrupt, engaging in subjectively pleasurable activities, then their morality is lacking, and this Golden Mean is not achieved. Therefore, it can be seen that Virtue ethics varies significantly from corruption, and a universal application of such a theory cannot retract the damage it has done culturally. However, it can be stated that ethical practices vary globally, and the desire to do good remains the same. For example, in the United States, shaking hands shows a sign of friendship, but within Asian societies, individuals bow to communicate their friendship and respect for one another. Therefore, there should be no classification nor difference in the expressions of behaviours in these different moral systems; different behaviours eventually express similar intentions. It is a universal concept. Foot notes that all societies appear to consider certain characteristics as moral virtues, such as honesty. This could infer that the global morality Virtue ethics holds is integral to the progression of a corrupt-free world. Further, Virtue ethics focuses solely on the pursuits of behaving morally and living life by way of virtue and wisdom. This \u2018eudaemonia\u2019 is sought to be a \u2018socially unifying concept\u2019 of ultimate fulfilment, particularly that one can be happy without jeopardising the happiness of someone else. Individuals who possess such virtues naturally act in a degree of excellence, but they also project their values through their actions. Despite progression to a more modernist way of living, which may involve some form of corruption, virtue ethicists wholly pursue a good life and live according to such virtues. Within this normative theory, every human experience has a narrative. To act in an ethical manner, they should seek to display the most morally fulfilled way of life. But surely there is a risk of corrupt behaviour here. This narrative should not be achieved by damaging someone else\u2019s life as it is unreasonable for fulfilment to arise from conflict in behaviours as these conflicts with this \u2018unifying project of eudemonia\u2019. To not \u2018encroach on anyone\u2019s behaviour\u2019, one must identify which actions constitutes virtuousness. Cunningham suggests that although Virtue ethics does not provide a concrete structure for decision making, there are some scenarios which provide enough clarity to suitably reflect such ideologies. In such scenarios, one should acknowledge the virtues present and respect them whilst also acknowledging vices, such as corruption. Holistically, even if one course of action seems advantageous, to reflect on this personal narrative is most appropriate. Though it seems easier to take a route which overlooks virtue, it is no way to live in the long-term, and to engage in corruptive behaviours compromises this. To obtain a sense of inherent morality is a lifelong haul and virtue cannot be displayed on a selective basis. Virtues and vices are quite the opposite. Virtues are entrenched in honesty and truthfulness. Therefore, individuals within administrations that engage in dishonesty by taking bribes for example, is serious corruption; something that is reflected as being inherently morally evil. There is a \u2018broad array of misbehaviour\u2019 as to take bribes in secrecy behind the backs of those in the workforce removes elements of transparency. And though this may not affect every single person, a eudemonist approach is the best route. Hence, these public administrations have a duty to establish ethical standards by promoting an honest and compassionate government. But should they portray such virtues, corruption may still occur. A dishonest individual\u2019s intentions may be hidden through a false pretence of morality, allowing them to achieve an easy and comfortable life that is \u2018morally bankrupt\u2019 at the expense of others. This suggests the theory is greatly flawed with its outdated nature and \u2018misty, antiquarian air\u2019. Virtue ethicists refer to morality as being the most integral part of an individual, and to ensure a better world, the world needs better people. Dawson and Bartholomew state that instead of increasing the number of ethical rules, there must be more focus on producing more inherently honest individuals. Perhaps this can be appropriately assessed in conjunction with the work of Aristotle; there must be a middle road between the ethical absolutism of Socrates and the ethical relativism of Sophists. This Virtue ethics views morality as \u2018both a human convention and the product of a reasoned search\u2019 on what a good person is. Virtue ethics and the disguise of corruption The theory remains vague. Raising the question as to whether those who fight corruption are truly moral characters. For example, when assessing the World Bank and the IMF, though these two organisations are deeply invested in the international portrayal of morality, they are also seen to be highly controversial. It appears to be ironic that two organizations who overtly abide by these ethical practices and are promoters of a \u2018global free enterprise\u2019, contradict Klitgaard\u2019s general anti-corrupt formula (C=M+D-A). Both display a great deal of discretion (D) as well as being monopolistic, (M) but are not accountable (A). With reference to corruption, they do not discuss that privatisation has increased the amount of corruption to countries where they have given loans to. Further, these organizations anti-corruption strategies are more inconclusive than can be seen. Being public bodies, funded by taxpayers, with the goal to promote their global interest, they can even be seen to \u2018misuse the public office for private gain\u2019. Though they are also very socially involved organisations, Everett states that Virtue ethics forces one to criticise their dubious moral characters. To promote a more ethical business climate, in order to increase business itself, it must be understood that these individuals are less than virtuous characters. Yes, a Virtue ethics perspective does ensure an insight into this global anti-corruption, but Maguire proposes that balance is needed to ensure that moral judgement depends on what is perceived as the most appropriate action within a specific situation. But, should this be further analysed, principles and goals are a necessary step in the progression of moral development. Until humans are personally involved in their tasks, then they are not competent performers. Hence, the attempt to better oneself is evidences virtuosity. Therefore, Virtue ethics may be necessary in a world that seeks to reduce corruptive actions and can be done so by way of reform via this theory. Nonetheless, the theory \u2018lacks fully developed examples\u2019 in contemporary literature suggesting it is outdated and does little to aid the reduction of global corruption. Religious influences upon corruption Should we truly assess its definition, corruption is defined as the \u2018misuse of entrusted power for private gain\u2019. And though such a phenomenon is significantly witnessed as being greater in some countries, researches agree that this has a negative effect upon its development. It appears to be an \u2018important variable\u2019 of both social and cultural conditions. Perhaps this can be addressed deeper with reference to religion. The virtues in a particular religion navigate a hierarchal system that the country follows. These countries may have cultural factors that are underpinned by religion, affecting human behaviour as a result. Essentially, to follow religious practices because it is \u2018virtuous\u2019, so, to truly believe you are doing good, may in fact be the latter and covertly corruptive. For example, though embezzlement and bribery are forbidden in both Christianity and Islam, these forms of corruption are present in Islamic and Catholic countries. Moreover, in both these religions, corruption was significantly greater because of its damaging effects upon democracy and equality. It is a negative phenomenon. It is a vice; so it is interesting that Islamic countries have some of the highest corruption levels in the world. To be a virtue ethicist, one must do what the \u2018virtuous agent\u2019 should. But it goes one step further. Individuals must emulate the virtuous person and seek to be a virtuous agent as opposed to act like one. If one follows Islam, believing that some of its extremist views are for the betterment of oneself, and completing particular actions they believe may achieve Aristotle\u2019s \u2018Golden Mean\u2019, then why are they rooted in such violence? For better understanding, the Sharia law permits that women be stoned to death for adultery as it is a legally sanctioned punishment outlined in the Iranian Penal Code. Haugh argues that though Islam prohibits \u2018every type of fraud and deception\u2019 it still contributes to the oppression of women under this social guise of being moral. It is not mentioned to stone a woman in the Qur\u2019an; thus, using the pretence of religion to employ corruptive behaviour and degrade women demonstrates negative influences of this hierarchal system and the violation of basic human rights. Men can engage in polygamous relationships, but women are punished for being adulterous. Moreover, the \u2018misuse of religion\u2019 plays a significant role as it fails to properly teaching of basic moral and ethical values, engaging in \u2018pure, self-centred materialistic objectives\u2019 instead. This suggests that religious countries may have vices disguised as virtues, leading to corruption, thus being a global phenomenon. Virtue ethics therefore does not do enough to control the negative implications in which religion is manipulated for selfish purposes. It enables this phenomenon as opposed to reducing it. Political corruption When assessing its political origins, one can agree that through demonstration in totalitarian societies of Nazism and Communism in the 20th century, corruption is an inevitable concept that is \u2018deeply entrenched\u2019 in society. In political philosophy, corruption is a fundamental concept which signifies the destruction and degradation of a community. This degradation of society has been evident for years. In Plato\u2019s political philosophy, corruption is fundamental in the movement of an ideal state to a tyrannical one. When looking at government of Montesquieu, corruption was present as a danger to the republic. Corruptive relations may lead to the destruction of particular principles between legislative, executive and legal powers of state, challenging the unity of the republic, essentially leading to the breakdown of the state in a society dominated by power as opposed to fairness and justice. It has been present for generations and corruption is necessary to progress politically. However, though essential in a political economy of society, relating to the social exchange of goods, it is also the \u2018negation of established structures\u2019 making it extremely dangerous for the political economy of societies. It gives rise to a \u2018model of destruction and dissolution\u2019 within society. Should bribery occur to achieve a social advantage, corporations that use this method change their identities from being an actor to agent, overlook social structures of sellers and buyers making it increasingly destructive to the \u2018ideals of free competition\u2019. Therefore, corruption appears as a fundamental threat to the economy because of links to destruction and disruption of these once established rules of social exchange of buyers and sellers. It appears as a \u2018vicious circle\u2019 of corrupt economics increasing risks of bribery. Therefore, elements of Virtue ethics may be put into place to stop this \"vicious circle\" from destroying the previous ethical, economic practices. Corruption literature must be analysed through exploration of this global theory. This involves bribery, abuses of public roles and resources, and mistrust of power. DeLeon asserts that when viewing political corruption in the United States, it is a \u2018cooperative form of unsanctioned (\u2026) policy for significant personal gain\u2019 and such bribery varies culturally. Notably, one culture may offer some money to a public official as a bribe, but other cultures consider this to be goodwill. Hence, societies appear as different in the way they consider self-interest. This is a key feature of anti-corruption campaigns. Corruption is a misuse of public power suggesting it is relational. Yes, there may be differences between levels of petty and grand corruption, but the definition is overall ubiquitous. Though it varies, it is unquestionably a global phenomenon. For decades, a \u2018corruption eruption\u2019 continues to be witnessed. The economic integration of globalisation appears to \u2018collectively contribute\u2019 to the corruptive circumstances. Nonetheless, moral reasoning is vital in order to become less corrupt. Dramer asserts that a two-part programme must be put in place to build character development and develop virtues such as honesty, loyalty and benevolence to positively contribute to ethical imaginativeness. But even with such measures put in place, more needs to be done to stop the nature of corruption and Virtue ethics alone does not provide ultimate relief for this phenomenon. Morality, the Law and Virtue ethics There is great debate on the links between Virtue ethics and the law. Though the theory primarily focuses upon the inner life of a person, questions can be raised with regards to whether it is truly capable of doing the law justice. It holds many constraints. Stole argues that the current model based upon Aristotelianism fail to explain how morality is governed. If general principles do not govern individual morality, then they can do so in the form of laws. They can govern policies and elements of morality need not be present and threaten such an approach. Should these policies be governed by Virtue ethics\u2019 internal morality, this agent-based approach, then the possibilities of \u2018real constraint on action\u2019 appear to be doubtful. Hence, the law is separate from morality. Morality has no relationship to corruption in this sense, as the law is entirely derivative\u2019 from the motives and characteristics of individuals who appear to act corrupt suggesting Virtue ethics is separate. However, elements of Virtue ethics are present in the law. Greenberg proposes a more radical view that the law is the \u2018moral impact of the relevant actions of legal institutions\u2019 hereby stating that it is a subset of morality. The impact that our moral rights and duties have is authorised by the actions of legal officials. Thus, these legal obligations are genuine ones that are obtained in a Virtue of the actions of legal institutions. Perhaps this may view the law as present to be a set of officials that are authorized to take actions to resolve disputes; displaying morality and duty to do good as a result of such actions. Therefore, the links between Virtue ethics, and this inner duty to do good is reflected inherently within the law. Should the law mould itself to become a \u2018theoretical authority\u2019 regarding moral obligations, then corruption can be reduced with a more subjective stance upon the law. Nonetheless, links between the law and morality may not be present at all. Enoch states that \u2018triggering reasons\u2019 are sufficient justifications to act in a socially-approved way. This infers a more common observation for the law taking such actions and perhaps the need for Virtue ethics and normative morality is rejected. Legal implications Both Hart and Kelsen propose that the law is a normative system. This nature of law must focus on legal normativity and to truly assess the position of Virtue ethics; corruption and the law, one must dissect the connections between this legal normativity and morality. Particularly, the Kelsenian approach asserts that all normative systems are both structurally and logically similar, but each normative system appears as independent of every other system. It can be concluded that the law is \u2018conceptually separate from morality\u2019. Kelsen further argues that the normative nature of law is assigned to both \"is\" and \"ought\" statements and that the implications for every normative conclusion must lead to a normative premise. Therefore, in a normative system like the law, or morality and religion, this \"ought\u2019 aspect indeed requires justifications from a more general \"ought statement\" thus leading to a normative hierarchal structure and somewhat \u2018sceptical conclusions\u2019 regarding morality. By way of example, one may accept or reject the ultimate norm, to do what \"the Creator God commands\". The fact that these vital normative systems of an individuals\u2019 life, such as morality and the law, can be accepted or rejected leads to great ambiguity and \u2018relativistic implications\u2019. This suggests that Virtue ethics is uncertain, morality does little to reduce corruption which may need to be resolved via objective methods instead. Conclusion Overall, corruption is indeed identified as a global phenomenon and Virtue ethics does little to help the reduction of such behaviours. In fact, being one of the oldest theories in Western philosophy, Virtue ethics is outdated, and quite frankly forgotten. Though there are elements displayed in religion, elements of the law, and general society, it fails to inhibit the spread of corruption. Virtue ethics\u2019 subjectivity does little justice to an increasing issue evident within the modern world. Believing in such an idealistic theory perhaps ensures more damage than betterment thus concluding that this global phenomenon will continue regardless.", "positive": "Hotels - 2 Options Clairon Hotel Helsinki: Has harbour views, includes a restaurant and is a good location should you be tired after attending a conference and want to relax. \u00c2\u00a3118 per night.

{"id": "aug_651", "anchor": "Background Information Kenya Airways celebrated 43 years of operations in January 2020. However, according to passengers who have recently flown with Kenya Airways, the airline is performing poorly and not meeting customer expectations. Standards have decreased and the quality of the overall experience has worsened. Based on the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, this is evident. There have been many occurrences of lost luggage, poor customer service within the airport and on the aircraft, and insufficient in-flight entertainment. This report will address these complaints using the quantitative and qualitative data collected and analysed to make comparisons with and provide sufficient recommendations for improvement. Quantitative Research Secondary data, \"data previously collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand.\" (Malhotra, Nunan and Birks, 2017) was gathered for a 5-year period (2016 - 2020 inclusive). The data was then logged into an Excel spreadsheet, where the customer name, gender, travel month and year, cabin type i.e. economy, route i.e. international, origin and destination were provided along with the overall rating of the experience and individual rating of each characteristic. The sampling technique used was stratified sampling: \"\u2026a two-step process to partition the population into strata. Elements are selected from each stratum randomly.\" (Malhotra, Birks and Willis, 2013). Customers\u2019 reviews were picked based on the year but at random. This technique was also chosen due to its increased precision and the need to include important information i.e. all eight individual ratings completed. Customers who had not completed all eight reviews were ignored during the selection procedure as all eight reviews had to be completed to enable graphs to be drawn and comparisons and conclusions to be made. The question that rises from the data collected is: \"does gender influence the ratings of airline services?\" The two sample groups are male and female. A grouping variable t-test was carried out to work out the significance (appendix 2b). Since we have two groups, we want to compare the mean of \u2018Array 1\u2019 represented by males and \u2018Array 2\u2019 represented by females. As it is not known which gender scored a higher average rating, a two-tailed test using equal variances (2) needs to be carried out. Our results show a significance of 0.56 (to 2 d.p.), which indicates that it is not statistically significant. The significance value is more than 0.05 (p&gt;0.05) and the t-value is less than 1.96 (t&lt;1.96) which proves the results are not significant. Therefore, there is no difference in one gender rating services higher than the other, and there is no expectation that the differences will be replicated in other samples. To support this further, the airline characteristics ratings were split by gender, where the number of males were 50 and the number of females were 28. A table of the average individual ratings and standard deviation were recorded (appendix 2a) and a graph to represent the averages was drawn as shown on the next page. From the graph, it is evident that females gave lower ratings compared to males (except for \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019, where males rated it an average of 3.10 and females rated it 3.18). The biggest difference in ratings was for \u2018legroom\u2019 with a difference of 0.33. The standard deviation for males and females is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and there is a normal distribution. Therefore, it supports our hypothesis test of there not being a significant difference. An overall average airline rating was calculated and plotted in a graph as shown below. The graph shows that the most poorly rated characteristic was the \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 with a rating of 3.06. With all individual ratings being around 3, the overall rating can be assumed as an average of 3. We can compare these results with the overview of the official rating of the airline displayed on the TripAdvisor website (appendix 1b). The link for the website page is indicated by appendix 1c. The results are similar to the TripAdvisor ratings meaning the data collected is representative of the population. The standard deviation was also calculated for comparison and recorded in a table along with the averages (appendix 1a). From the table, it is evident that the standard deviation is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and that there is a normal distribution. To understand whether each characteristic has improved from 2016-2020, a table of averages was created (appendix 3). The table shows the total average for each year declining, where the best year was 2016 (average of 3.77) and the worst year was 2020 (average of 2.91) \u2013 the graph indicates this. A line graph was drawn to represent this information (below). The biggest decline was from 2019 to 2020, with a difference of 0.44. However, there was an improvement in the customer service from 2018-2019 with a rise of 0.57. In the year 2017, \u2018cleanliness\u2019 had the highest average (3.92) compared to the rest of the years. Again, this proves that quality of services has been declining. Therefore, the overall quality of characteristics has worsened. Qualitative Research To further support the quantitative analysis, secondary qualitative research was carried out. This was done by randomly selecting 25 customer reviews from the years 2016-2020 (5 for each year). All 25 reviews were analysed, and a coding frame (appendix 4a) was written up to categorise the factors further. For example, check-in and boarding was broken down into flights, luggage, and other. This was to understand in detail what the reviews highlighted. Appendix 4b indicates an example of an analysed positive review that includes characteristics such as value for money, check-in and boarding, seat comfort, food and beverage, and in-flight entertainment. For example, the customer (travel year 2020) commented on the \u2018seats being very comfortable\u2019. The average rating for seat comfort in 2020 was 3.10. Although there was a very minor decrease (0.05) from 2019, it can be assumed the seat comfort is steady and quality is not changing drastically. However, throughout the 5-year period, customer service was the most frequently complained about (airline staff and cabin crew) with a total of 12 negative complaints each. Airline staff includes staff who are not directly involved in the airport or aircraft, but are still part of Kenya Airways staff i.e. headquarters, call centres etc. The majority of complaints relating to airline staff were about staff being unfriendly, impolite, and incompetent. Some reviews mentioned that staff need to be trained as there was no sense of empathy. On the other hand, there was 1 positive review which mentioned the service being on a \u2018high level\u2019. Cabin crew also had 12 negative reviews, mostly about the staff not caring about errors made as well as not apologising. On the other hand, there were 9 positive reviews, making the total -3. This tells us that although there are positive customer service reviews, there are more negative ones meaning that customer service is worsening over the years. This can be also be proved by the graph shown by appendix 3 where the customer service rating fell from 2016 (4.00) to 2020 (2.90). This indicates greater confidence in customer service declining as there are frequent reviews to support this. Appendix 4c shows a negative review written by a customer in 2016. The review mentions customer service (airport staff and cabin crew) and food and beverage (qualityportion). Again, customer service was poor due to staff not caring or apologising. Furthermore, the airline had run out of vegetarian meals and no drinks were offered either. The coding frame shows the total for \u2018qualityportion\u2019 as -3, indicating that the airline is performing poorly in this service. Appendix 1a highlights that \u2018food and beverage\u2019 is the second lowest characteristic rated by customers with an average of 3.25. This supports the coding frame. On the other hand, there are three characteristics where the airline is performing well \u2013 legroom, seat comfort, and food and beverage \u2013 taste. The total scores based on the coding frame are 2, 3, and 2 respectively. Legroom had 2 positive reviews, both commenting on spaciousness, seat comfort had 4 positive reviews, and food and beverage \u2013 taste, had 4 positive reviews commenting on good and fresh taste. However, there were also negative reviews for seat comfort, where seats were not as comfortable and the taste of food not being great. Overall, Kenya Airways are doing well in these areas of service. Appendix 1a shows this for \u2018legroom\u2019 as it has the second highest average rating of 3.60, which supports the qualitative research and indicates greater confidence since reviews are consistent hence representative. Whilst appendix 4b has a positive review based on flying business class, other customers travelling in business class had negative experiences, based on poor customer service, rude staff and lost luggage. Therefore, this demonstrates inconsistency of the airline as customers are receiving different treatment even when demographics are the same. Rather, customers in business class are having the same issues as those travelling in economy, which raises the question as to whether Kenya Airways view all customers as equivalent despite paying extra for better service. Moreover, staff are lacking in training which leads to poor service regardless of whichever cabin customers are flying in. Recommendations Kenya Airways are performing at an average level (3.0) in comparison to competitors such as Qatar Airways (4.0) (Qatar Airways Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020) and Emirates (4.0) (Emirates Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020). While Kenya Airways are scoring close to an average rating of 4.0 in characteristics such as \u2018cleanliness\u2019 (3.71) and \u2018legroom\u2019 (3.60), they are scoring low in characteristics such as \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 (3.06) and \u2018food and beverage\u2019 (3.25) while receiving frequent complaints about services such as \u2018check-in and boarding\u2019 and \u2018customer service\u2019. Therefore, in order to excel, regain customer confidence and outperform competitors, many improvements need to be made throughout the airline. Firstly, improvements need to be made in customer service, mainly the airport staff and cabin crew. According to reviews on TripAdvisor, the cabin crew have a lack of care and are impolite towards passengers. As suggested by customers and to avoid future negative interactions with passengers, training needs to take place frequently e.g. every 4-6 months to ensure staff members are able to handle situations with care, show understanding and remain polite. Once training is complete, staff should be tested by answering scenario questions. Those who score less than 70% should undergo further training. The process can be repeated until they score 70% or over. Customers who feel comfortable and at ease are more likely to have a positive flight experience, resulting in greater positive reviews and higher ratings. Moreover, airport staff are being criticised of showing attitude and being unhelpful. Again, training needs to take place to avoid future negative experiences. A similar assessment as the cabin crew can be carried out with questions aimed more specifically for airport staff. Secondly, the in-flight entertainment needs to be improved. Passengers have complained about the equipment being broken and the movie list not being up to date. This can be quite frustrating especially when flying for long hours as there is no sufficient entertainment available to use. The first course of action should be for the movie listing to be updated (as mentioned in one review) on all aeroplanes and provide a wider array of entertainment as Emirates do (appendix 5). This will keep passengers entertained for the length of the flight. To avoid faulty equipment, all equipment should be checked before passengers aboard the plane. Finally, the portion and overall quality of food needs to be improved. There have been a number of complains written by customers who mention the portion size of food is little and sometimes drinks are not offered either. This can be seen as unacceptable, especially for those flying in businessfirst class as complimentary drinks are mandatory and passengers are paying extra (value for money). Portions need to increase as a result, by up to 25% to satisfy expectations and drinks need to be offered with every meal, as well as in between.", "positive": ", Please could you remove me from all future emails please as I am not able to help out this year.

{"id": "aug_653", "anchor": "This essay shall address the question \"What are the core assumptions and key features of the biological and psychoanalytical perspectives in psychology? In what ways are they similar and how do they differ?\". Each approach has their own individual assumptions and features, some of which are strengths and some of which are weaknesses, but each perspective has its place in psychological science as they can both be used in suitable situations, with the Biological approach being a more scientific, research based, utilitarian perspective, and the Psychoanalytical approach being a more theoretical, subjective, purity focused perspective towards psychology (Singh, 1991). One core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many of our adult behavior and feelings stem from childhood experiences. An example of this is Freud\u2019s theory of the Psychosexual developmental stages, a key feature of the Psychodynamic approach. This theory is characterized by the five stages of childhood development; these are the Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latent, and Genital stages (Brown, 1964). According to Psychodynamic theory, each of these stages must be successfully completed in order for the individual to progress, and failure to complete any particular stage will result in fixation. Fixation refers to the id\u2019s inability to transfer its pleasure-seeking focus from one psychosexual stage to the next. Without this natural progression, fixation will be shown in the behavior and feelings of the individual (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), for example someone with an oral fixation may take up smoking or start biting the nails, as they find pleasure in these oral-related activities. At this point, the Psychodynamic approach delves into the Biological side of psychology in a key feature referred to as \u2018Psychosomatic\u2019 disorders. This is the idea that unconscious psychological factors can produce physical manifestations, often seen as a disease or symptom, and that these disorders can be treated or cured by resolving the internal psychological cause, be it past trauma or a psychosexual fixation (Freud &amp; Riviere, 1961). This core assumption covers the \u2018nurture\u2019 side of the nature nurture debate as fixation tends to be the result of the way the child is raised, however the very presence of the psychosexual stages in everyone relates to the nature side of the debate. Another core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach is \u2018Psychic determinism\u2019. This is the theory that all behavior is caused by mental processes. This idea of all behavior having a psychological cause is shown in the psychodynamic theory of structure of personality. This structure is made up of three parts, the Id, Ego, and Superego, with the Id being the driving force behind our pleasure seeking behavior, the Superego counteracting the Id with the morality of our desires, and the Ego balancing the two to comply with the rules of society and reality (Freud &amp; Rickman, A General Selection from the Works of Sigmund Freud, 1953). Freud\u2019s theory of personality structure addresses the determinism versus free will dichotomy as, if all behavior is dictated by the interactions between the three structures, then the individual has no freedom in their actions. One last core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many feelings and behaviors are driven by unconscious forces. This is seen in Freud\u2019s theory of the Unconscious, which is in turn related to the theory of personality structure. The theory of the Unconscious separates the mind into three levels of consciousness; There is the Conscious which is our fully accessible thought, and then there is the Preconscious which can be accessed using psychodynamic techniques and the Unconscious which cannot be accessed, both of which operate in the subconscious level of thought (Freud &amp; Strachey, On Metapsychology: The Theory of Psychoanalysis, 1984). These are further related to the theory of personality structure as the different structures are located in different levels of consciousness. The Id operates solely in the Unconscious mind, the Ego exists mainly in the Conscious mind, and the Superego spans across all three levels of consciousness (Costigan, 1967). This interaction between the levels of consciousness is an example of the Psychodynamic approach\u2019s stance on the Idiographic versus Nomothetic debate, as the unconscious drives that affect behavior are generalized to humanity as a whole rather than individuals being affected by different unconscious forces or having differing levels of consciousness. A core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is that for psychology to be considered a valid science rather than a pseudoscience, then it must be treated as a science. In order for this to happen the scientific method must be upheld as it would be in any other scientific field of study, including using correct experimental methods such as Laboratory, Field, Natural, and Quasi experiments (Beatty, 2001). These are used to test hypotheses, the data from which is then peer reviewed. This core assumption relies on the Determinism argument rather than free will; For causational relationships between variables to be identified, particularly in regard to behavior, the assumption must be made that there is a cause at all (Green, 1987). In this case, the Biological is similar to the Psychodynamic approach. Another core assumption of the Biological approach, and perhaps the most important assumption in this approach, is the idea that many if not all behavioral characteristics are due to internal biological processes. This can include hormones, neuronal activity, and the genetic make up of an individual, as well as externally caused internal reactions such as brain damage (Kolb &amp; Whishaw, 2008). One way psychologists can study biological causes of behavior is through direct observation as the phenomena occur. Methods of this include brain scans such as MRI, ECG and EEG, and less brain-focused methods such as blood tests (Kalat, 2017). However, these methods can be quite invasive and are not always valid methods of measuring the inner-most structures of the brain. To address this issue, post-mortem studies are conducted (Groves &amp; Rebec, 1992). This is a key feature of the Biological approach where the brains of individuals, often with abnormal brain processes, are studied after death to observe the physical structure of these brains. As biological processes often take place on a scale too small to directly observe, biological psychologists often must resort to making inferences based on observable data, another key feature of the approach. A final core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is the idea of the evolutionary explanation for certain behaviors. The Darwinian theory of evolution features heavily in biological psychology, as some behaviors seem to be instinctual from birth. For example, particular phobias can be observed in young children even though the participants have never had any contact with the phobic stimulus before. \u2018Ophidiophobia\u2019 is an abnormal fear of snakes, and can be seen in children who have never before had any experience with snakes (Fredrikson, Annas, Fischer, &amp; Vik, 1996). The evolutionary explanation would suggest that this fear is instinctual and has been inherited as a survival mechanism to ensure the continuation of the individual\u2019s genes (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). This core assumption is an example of the nomotheticism of the Biological approach, as the theory of heredity of behavior is generalized to the entirety of humanity, as well as other species. The Biological and the Psychodynamic approaches both have weaknesses, some shared between the two approaches, some differing. Whilst Biopsychology takes a wider idiographic approach to behavior which can be considered to be overly simplistic and excessively generalized, the Psychodynamic approach uses an individual\u2019s childhood experiences to explain behavior, an idiographic method which may be considered to be too subjective to qualify as anything more than pseudoscience. The Biological approach uses the strictly monitored scientific method to prove hypotheses, using empirical data to demonstrate causational relationships between biological processes and behavioral phenomena (Breedlove &amp; Watson, 2013), whereas elements of the Psychodynamic approach uses methods that are dependent on the subjective interpretations of the psychologist using them, for example dream analysis (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), making it difficult to form concrete theories about certain behaviors. However, some assumptions of the two approaches can be seen as strengths of the different schools of thought. For example, the quantification of data used in many areas of Biopsychological research enables the results to be carefully and extensively analyzed to find correlations between variables and behavioral traits, and often lead to identifying causational relationships for feelings and behavior. The Psychodynamic approach uses more qualitative research which can be useful when producing Psychoanalytical treatments for individual patients. Also, the Biological approach takes a more utilitarian view towards psychology as a science. This means that the research conducted by Biological psychologists is focused around the practical uses of the results. It could be argued that this is partly due to the high financial cost of biological research, which requires grants and funding from organizations that would benefit from the results. The Psychodynamic approach has a more psychological purity point of view when it comes to research, meaning that some of the research and theories are produced purely for the philosophical understanding of behavior (Clark, 1980). For example, it could be argued that the theory of personality structure has very limited practical use as the Id, Ego and Superego cannot be directly interfered with, even though it is a possible explanation to help psychologists understand behavior. To conclude, both the Biological and the Psychoanalytic have some similar key features and core assumptions, and others that differ between the two. Each perspective has its own strengths and weaknesses and their own practical applications. Inevitably there will always be individuals who strongly disagree with one or the other, but given the chance each approach has something to offer modern view of psychology.", "positive": "med to be, he\u2019s checking if can make the No, we can do a proper brunch in the sun instead?

Or is it the same information being taught in both session and therefore one or the other? Thank you, hope you\u2019re well! Hello, Since receiving the recent TP2 update that there will actually be no changes to teaching after Christmas, I was wondering if there will now be an opportunity to cancel accommodation. When the students were booking accommodation, we were under the impression that after Christmas we would be going back to being in university physically, and therefore we had no obligation to cancel or postpone our payments - due to the recent change, are there going to be any opportunities for this, as it would be preferable not to be paying over \u00a36000 for an unneeded room? Thank you, Hi, I was writing to enquire about possible cancellation of my room due to the new updates with TP2 that there will still be no in person contact on campus. I, as many others, booked accommodation under the idea that there would be a need to be coming in every week, but since the university are having seminars and lectures online, and have confirmed that this won\u2019t change in as they first believed it would, it would be really beneficial to me to be able to not pay for a room I no longer use. Due to the continued increase of cases within , I am currently back at home, therefore the room is not being used but being paid for. I understand that there is a contract, but I would really appreciate any help that could be given within the current circumstances. I understand that no one was to know what would go on, and that is why I booked the room in the first place. Even if the full cancellation isn\u2019t possible yet, would there be any chance that this would be possible in the future? Maybe after Christmas or in the final term as was done at the end of last year? I really appreciate any help, and thank you in advance,", "positive": "thank you very much!

The seafront is absolutely stunning so I think you'll enjoy it. The hotel has a restaurant that serves breakfast too. There's a National Museum of Finland that shows Finland's history starting right from the Stone Age, which is a 7 minutes drive from the hotel. The typical national dish is Sauteed Reindeer and the restaurant serving it or versions of it is called; Kaarna Baari &amp; Britto, which is about 6 minutes drive from the hotel. It specialises in local dishes. Kankurin Tupa is a gift shop where you can buy souvenirs for your children and it's about 7 minutes from the hotel. Finally, there's the Apollo live club that hosts events such as comedy and live music concerts (not opera), about 6 minutes drive from the hotel. All in all, a short but packed trip with everything you want to do close by, I hope you have a great time there.

{"id": "aug_664", "anchor": "Dear Madam, Here are the details of the itinerary items I have created for your conference trip to Helsinki between the 2nd and 4th of September 2021. I have found a 4-star hotel situated 0.4 miles away from the city centre. For two nights it will cost \u00a3216. It is also situated close to the Seurasaraselka waters so, if we book a room with a view you will always get to see the water. This is \u00a316 over budget but it was the best option in regards to tourist reviews and location. Caferino Obas is a cafe, which is only a ten-minute walk away from the hotel and they offer a great breakfast menu. They offer a wide range of options and alternatives for those who are allergic to Seafood. Helsinki Museum is a twenty-minute walk from the hotel but it is specifically a museum popular with tourists for being able to \"uphold Helsinki's heritage\". Therefore you will learn a lot about the city you are visiting. Finland's national dish is Saute\u00e9d Reindeer. So I have found a very popular restaurant called Restaurant Lasipalatsi which offers this dish. They have a wide range of sides to go with this dish and before booking the restaurant we are able to call them up beforehand and warn them about your seafood allergy. Therefore the food will be catered for you specifically. There is a souvenir shop called Mikebon which offer a wide range of gifts. Especially toys which may be great for your children. Finally, for the evening I have found a Rock Music Club called Tavastia. Since you love live music I have found a club that offers Helsinki's popular genre and the club itself is quite old so this holds some heritage too. I hope you like the suggestions. If you have any queries or changes, please let me know and I will be happy to look further. Best Wishes", "positive": "nk you very much !!! I appreciate it.

{"id": "aug_673", "anchor": "Background Information Superdrug are a UK health and beauty retailer and the second largest behind competitor Boots plc, with 900 stores across the UK and Ireland and a few European countries. In 2016 it became the UK\u2019s fastest growing retailer in its industry, doubling its profit in the previous year. Superdrug have employed over 14,000 people across all their locations. In 2011 they launched their loyalty card as part of their \u2018Take another look\u2019 campaign and in 2015 the card was re-branded and given a new name. Presently, the loyalty card has seen a decline in the past 3 years, with less customers signing up our using their card. Aims and Objectives From the brief we understand that the overall aim of this proposal is to regain numbers in your loyalty programme and make sure that they remain consistent or rise in the long-term. Therefore, the overall objective, of this study is to investigate the cause of the decline in Superdrug\u2019s loyalty program. This proposal will identify factors contributing to the loyalty decline in order for the marketing team to begin working on plausible solution. Some key questions that should be asked are: \u2022 Are members of the loyalty program currently satisfied with the program? \u2022 Are the current marketing efforts effective? \u2022 Why have some customers abandoned the program? What did they not like about the pro- gram? Research Design The study will consist of one quantitative and one qualitative method. The first part of the study will target customers that have left the loyalty scheme within the past 3 years. The aim is to discover why they chose to unsubscribe from the program. This will be the qualitative part of the study; a focus group, consisting of 10-15 participants, across the UK and Ireland. We recommend that the participants are as widespread as possible to avoid bias and display representation. As Focus groups are costly, we thought that we should start with a small sample to begin with, if this study proves useful it can be carried over to other European countries where Superdrug operates. The quantitative part of the study will focus on current members of the program, highlighting marketing efforts that encouraged them to join the programme and discovering whether they are currently satisfied with its offering. This information will be sought via an online questionnaire. Both stages of research will use an incentive to encourage participants to take part in the research. The reason why we would like to approach the study this is way is to gain an in-depth but representative understanding of the research problem. Research Method Qualitative Research It is unlikely that the participants would travel far for something like this, so we suggest that phone interviews are conducted. Each interview would last approximately 10-15 mins, as research has shown that this is the average time that customers would be willing to take part in this type of interview. The questions will be a mix of open-ended and closed questions allowing some quantifiable answers as well as thoughts and opinions which are equally valuable. The incentive provided could be a generous discount of 50% off all purchases at Superdrug for the next 6 months. The data will be collected, and content analysed. Quantitative Research This is supporting research to the phone interviews. Essentially, we are looking at conducting a survey for all shoppers, targeting a response rate of 200 participants, using a 15% discount as an incentive to respond. The participants will be gathered from the mailing list of beauty card users in the UK and Ireland. The survey will ask questions related to their overall experience of being a card user, from what marketing tools encouraged them to sign up to if they would recommend the service and an overall numerical rating of the service. The responses will be collected and analysed by a computer system. Sampling technique The sample of Customers are a mix of previous and current program users. The aim is to identify the similarities between the groups likes and dislikes about the program which should help identify the causes for the program\u2019s decline. The telephone interviews should consist of female participants ranging from age 14-25 (they\u2019re main target audience). Superdrug should contact participants via email, which should be stored in their database. Consider potential methods for data analysis The telephone interviews will be analysed using thematic coding. Using the interview transcripts, the responses will be sorted into broad themes and the number of times these appear will be recorded in a tally. The highest scoring \u2018theme\u2019 will be an indication as to the cause. This can be correlated with the answers received from the survey. As for the survey, all answers can be calculated via a computer, which can later be converted into bar charts or other visual graphs for easy presentation to management teams. Ethical conduct In both cases it is Important to get consent from all participants. In particular the participants of the telephone interview, who are ex-loyalty card users, there should be no harassment from the interviewer nor should the participant be made to feel bad for their decision to leave the program. All participants need to be made aware beforehand that the interview will be recorded, allowing them the opportunity to withdraw if they choose. For all participants taking part in the survey, terms and conditions outlining what the data will be used for should be agreed to. For participants that are under the age of 18, it should be made clear that a parent needs to consent to the terms and conditions.", "positive": "That colour is actually blush pink \ud83d\ude0c Yes Do you know her size? *morning I dont think it was keen on the Ayamase Nope This one is still talking \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude29 Please remember to get me a computer mouse and would like one too Ive seen this one very cutie Okay babyyy \ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffd Eh Party starting..\ud83c\udfb6 Testing Dont forget has a lesson at 6 tomorrow \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 nooooo And the boy just sat there Calling There may be a purple one, but that one is unscented.

Hello, I am interested in the course at the ( ). I have just completed a years placement at the and am now entering my final year of studies for at . I was wondering if you would be able to provide me with some guidance on the entry requirements for this course. I have attached the latest copy of my results transcript but am concerned that some of my grades may not be high enough. 90 of the 120 credits for my final year are focused. I would appreciate any guidance you are able to give me in this matter. Many thanks, Hi , I'm a final year student so unfortunately cannot provide you with all the help you need- however I will do my best to help you solve these issues. To discuss module changes you should contact the . I believe the best email to use is: In regards to the placement year, as far as I'm aware this is a compulsory component for all undergraduate students, with the exception of international students. Therefore, removing this from your degree would depend upon your situation. I understand your concerns around a placement year especially in the current climate however, having just completed my own placement year I cannot recommend it enough! It really does stand out to employers on graduate job applications and the experiences it provides are above and beyond the skills you will gain through a degree alone. Hope this helps, Hi , Unfortunately, I don't take and I'm not aware of any study groups for this module. I don't know anyone who takes the module to ask them either I'm affriad. The other student rep , might take the module so it could be worth asking him too!

{"id": "aug_680", "anchor": "Rationale: The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today\u2019s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual\u2019s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual\u2019s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. Results: Discourse 1- negativity of social media Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. Discourse 2- vital for families Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person. Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. Discourse 3- loneliness Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely. Discourse 4- social media not healthy Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved. Discussion: Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely. Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling. The wrong way to do it is by lying or exaggerating on social media just to acquire a specific response or reaction from the people reading it.", "positive": "ould like to apologise for sending in my quiz 9 minutes late, the internet in my house doesn't always work which means that I usually go to the library to send off any assignments.

I rang them up around 5:30pm asking about the student deal for a free medium pizza which I have used before. I was calling on behalf of my boyfriend so he could claim his pizza using the code they sent him like I did. When on the phone to a member of staff named he claimed they have \"never ever given away a free pizza\". He mentioned on the phone that he was the manager and had never accepted this deal. I told him that I and many of my friends have received a free pizza because of the code. He said I was wrong and accused me of lying but I told him I have proof. He said bring the proof to the store that I received a free medium pizzas and he will give us 2 pizzas for free. So I walked to the store with my boyfriend and showed him the receipt that was emailed to myself stating that I got a free pizza through collection. He then said the deal was over on the and they don\u2019t do collections anymore. However I read the fine prints and the deal ends and the store is still doing collections. We then said that we wanted the 2 free pizzas which he said he will give if I provide him with proof but he accused us of lying and refused service. He then started acting verbally and physically aggressive towards us. He got very unprofessional and started shouting at us and calling names. He told us to \"just fuck off\". As we left the store empty handed he then came through the side door and got very close to my boyfriend (avoiding the 2 meter distance) trying to start a fight which made me scared until the other workers grabbed and pulled him back. This could have potentially put our life at risk. He was shouting at us and called us names like \"prick\" and I will not accept that kind of behaviour. I am currently in the process of receiving camera footage from neighbouring shops to show the unexplainable behaviour by the member of staff.

{"id": "aug_684", "anchor": "Creativity is a characteristic of experts in solving a problem, it is an unusual and insightful solution which is of real value which involves the integration of ideas. Creative solutions must be novel and acknowledged by society. The study of creativity consists of the 4 p\u2019s which focuses either on, creative people, creative processes, products of creativity and creative places (environment). According to the psychometric approach, participants are tested using mental tests for direct measurements. However, such tests often confound intelligence and creativity, because not all creative people are high in IQ. Supporting this theory, Guilford (1956) distinguished between convergent and divergent thinking. He proposed that convergent thinkers find one best solution to a problem whereas, divergent thinkers can lead to many solutions to the same problem. He concluded that, creativity is a form of divergent thinking, because it brings many unrelated ideas together, also known as insight. Therefore, creativity makes use of methods which test divergent thinking such as the \"unusual uses test\" by J.P. Guilford (1967). Although divergent creativity tests are time consuming, they provide accurate measures of creativity than convergence. Creative Insight can occur in three ways (Sternberg and Davidson, 1982). Firstly, selective encoding refers to most important information being extracted from what is available. Secondly, selective combination is known to be the best way of combining information is perceived. Lastly, selectively comparison, whereby the information for the current problem being solved is related by analogy to a similar problem in one\u2019s past, which often uses mental images (Shepard 1978). Utilising these steps, creativity can be made easier to obtain. The biographic and autographic approach for creativity is idiosyncratic and makes major use of peer judgments. Wallas (1926) identified 4 stages in the creative process which include; preparation which refers to problem solving, incubation which is yet controversial, inspiration and verification whereby the solution is checked.", "positive": "lo, I have deleted the email account I had verified my account with , however it is not letting me chnage my number or chnage email for my account .. can I chnage my password in some other way Account name; Hi sir, I was wondering if year 12 students need to go in for results day tommorow because we have not been told anything.

{"id": "aug_685", "anchor": "Introduction In order to analyse to what extent English law\u2019s approach to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith is satisfactory, it important to understand that the fundamental attitude towards good faith and the recent developments in good faith, that lead to a paradox within the law. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd , Lord Bingham defined what good faith is synonymic to, which was \"playing fair\", \"coming clean\" or \"putting one\u2019s card face upwards on the table\". This approach has been embodied by most countries outside the common law world, whereby, there is an overriding principle of good faith. However, English law, tends to abide by a piecemeal technique, which means good faith is applied as and when it is needed, rather than a general law. Nonetheless, the courts have more recently signalled a departure from such approach, as it has become increasingly more common for courts to uphold the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, and in doing so, have caused a level of uncertainty within the law. This essay will argue that the approach Courts have taken to enforce promises to negotiate in good faith is in fact unsatisfactory. This essay develops, first, by explaining the general obligations of good faith and the traditional hostility towards it. Secondly, it will focus specifically on the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith and, whether, in fact, this has been enforceable. Finally, it will be explained that, despite the attempts to define what the Courts will uphold in relation to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate, it inevitably leads to courts being too involved in commercial business and therefore, undermines the commercial stability that England places on high importance. Traditional Views Towards Good Faith Historically, hostility towards the doctrine of good faith has been prevalent in English law. Traditionally, English law develops piecemeal solution in response to the specific problems they are faced with, rather than an imposing an overriding principle of good faith. The reasoning, for this, is it creates too much uncertainty and subjectivity, but arguably, more importantly, it allows for freedom of contract and party of autonomy. As put by, Sir Roy Goode \"in what we like to think \u2013 perhaps wrongly \u2013 is the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice. It is necessary in a commercial setting that businessmen at least should know where they stand.\" Thus, indicating, why the original approach to good faith, is satisfactory because it leads to commercial certainty, which is ingrained into English law. This is fundamental to the core, further evidenced, by the fact \"the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice.\" Conversely, this certainty that is placed on such high importance in English law, is being undermined by the exceptions where English law does recognise good faith, one of them being express promises to negotiate in good faith. Thus, meaning it is enforceable in courts. Many of these express terms to negotiate are based on the perception that both parties will be entering a joint venture, as there would be an intention to create a long term relation and parties may set out commitments for a specific time. The declarations made in the House of Lords decisions of HIH Casualty v Chase Manhattan Bank , Lord Hoffman observes that it goes without saying that underlying the contractual arrangement of the parties there will be a common assumption that the parties involved will behave honestly. Although, there may be express terms to negotiate in good faith, the nature of these relationships alone, should call for honest, open and fair dealing. This is considered to be a relational contract. Leggatt LJ explains that communication and co-operation is based on trust and loyalty might be crucial and impliedly expected by the parties, even if not expressly stated in contract. However, there is an issue with this definition as it has been criticised for a lack of explanation, as put by Severine Saintier, Leggatt J does not elaborate as to what relational contracts are precisely, why they require such enhanced good faithloyalty or what this would entail, which is regrettable. Such criticism simply strengthens the Court\u2019s previously hostile approach to the doctrine; due to the ambiguity in interpretation of the doctrine as there are no guidelines as to how the Court is to identify \"good faith\", and so is often done so subjectively. Express Promises To Negotiate In Good Faith Nevertheless, express terms to promise to negotiate in good faith, has been favoured and welcomed; due to the flexibility and adaptability it allows for within the contract. The freedom of inserting an article that mandates a negotiation, means that parties are able to prepare themselves for future, as the future is uncertain, they are unable to dictate what the commercial environment may look like in 20 years. For instance, events, such as a recession or a plummet in the market by including a term that opens the door for renegotiations in relation to the specific term. Cases, such as Petromec , the clause was 12.4 , where it states that \u2018 Brasoil agrees to negotiate in good faith with Petromc the extra costs..\u2019 This term emphasises why parties may include an express term in the contract for future insulation against potential risks that may occur. Enforceability of Promises to Negotiate through Development of Law. Case law paves the way for the enforceability of contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, by refining the scope of good faith. Walford v Miles, the case was as follows, the business owner promised the plaintiffs that it would terminate negotiations to sell business to third party, however, the business owner then sold the business to a third party. The plaintiffs argued that the business owner had a duty to negotiate in good faith. However, it was held that the promise to negotiate was unenforceable. Lord Ackner to be \"unworkable\" and \"inherently repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in negotiations.\" It is imperative for distinctions to be made between a good faith duty which governs pre \u2013 contractual relations and of those that concern a contractual performance, as well as the contrast between terms that are expressly codified for the intrusion of a duty of good faith. In light of this intricacy, Longmore LJ took on the role of understanding the criticisms that the courts have had with upholding a promise to negotiate, he pointed out three main arguments; one of them being that the obligation is an agreement to agree and this is too uncertain to enforce.. However, he dismissed this argument by stating that is carries little weight because the obligation on the facts was an express obligation in a contract that was otherwise enforceable. By arguing, these main points Longmore LJ has narrowed the vagueness, and this is best shown in the comparison of Walford v Miles and Petromec Inc v Petroleo, in the Walford case the contract was still to come into the effect of the good faith arrangement as it was still in the pre \u2013 negotiation stage, the contract was never concluded. However, in Petromec, it was clear that it was not just a bare agreement to negotiation, as it was a complex contract drafted by their lawyers. This case, is a crucial turning point in relation to promises to negotiate in good faith, as it maintains party autonomy and freedom of contract, which as mentioned is fundamental to Englands commercial environment, therefore, allows for a consistent and coherent standard of how express terms are upheld by the courts. The Quota To Satisfy Shaker v Visajet, was yet another case that was consistent with the way the Courts uphold express promises to negotiate in good faith. In this case, there was a promise to \u2018proceed in good faith\u2019 as well as \u2018use reasonable endeavours\u2019 to agree a documentation pursuant to the purchase of an aircraft. Teare J stated that there was no binding legal obligation based on the promise. The reason for this was because there was \u2018no objective criteria\u2019, that the court was able to decide whether the party acted unreasonably. This further enhances the distinction using Petromec , because in the case, there was sufficient objective criteria to make the promise enforceable. However, Shaker, meant that the courts devised a test in order to see if the express promises to negotiate is enforceable; the test requires two questions to be satisfied. The first criteria to meet is, \u2018is there a certainty of object?\u2019, this relates to clarity in what the negotiation was set out to achieve e.g. responding to a change in the circumstances. The second is \u2018 are there sufficient objective criteria to determine what a good faith negotiation looks like in the context of this particular contract?\u2019 This criteria relates to the idea that the Courts should be able to look at the contract and have the exact information to uncover, what the negotiation should look like in good faith. These cases all draw to the same conclusion that promises to negotiate in good faith should be upheld and is attempted to be done so by the Courts by using precedence, the courts should not avoid enforceability due to some vagueness, on how the term is to be upheld in practical contexts. Upholding the contract leading too much involvement Parties requiring terms to be upheld and enforced necessitates a court to work out what a good faith negotiation looks like in that contract, in fact it is vital to do so, because it is the only way to conclude if there has been a breach or not. There is too much vagueness surrounding the good faith negotiation, which inevitably leads to the Courts having to fill in the blanks, in essence leading them to \u2018make\u2019 the contracts for the parties. In fact, this interpretation is considered to take up more judicial time than all other areas of the law of contract put together. Although, Lord Hoffman came up with five principles governing how the courts should interpret written contracts, there was a lot of backlash for this as it was \u2018It was said to generate uncertainty because it appeared to widen the circumstances in which the judges could depart from the \u2018natural and ordinary meaning\u2019 of the words used by the parties.\u2019 The underlying issue is that, regardless, of how precise the terms are, it will inevitably lead to courts getting too involved in interpreting the contract and assuming what the parties meant instead of what they actually wrote. This in turn generates too much uncertainty and threatens the stability of the commercial environment. Alternatives to solve uncertainty Although, a common option for both parties is to include an arbitration, which is an alternate way of settling a dispute outside of courts, however, this has been criticised because the existence of the arbitration obligation specifically incorporated into clause itself indicates strongly that the parties were not intending to retain their freedom to agree or disagree according to their perceived interests. More importantly, as highlighted in the Emirates Trading and Associated British Ports, it leads to satellite litigation, meaning the parties go to Court arguing about not the specific breach of the contract but a separate matter arising from this, in the Emirates Trading case, it was about whether the good faith negotiation term was in fact enforceable. Satellite litigation is undesirable and in fact takes up the Courts resources and arguably, \"tends not to help with either expedition or the saving of expense and perhaps more than anything leads to disproportionality.\" Ironically, the very reason why the express promise to negotiate was avoid long-drawn-out dispute and going to court by resolving them through friendly discussions of good faith. Thus, indicating that going to court may lead to better solutions for the parties, simultaneously, altering the position and standpoint of the traditional view held by the English courts. Conclusion To conclude, express promises to negotiate in good faith is upholding, although it has been consistent and the requirements have been made unambiguous through case law and the enforceability by the Courts have also been constant, aiding the reliability and validity. However, the issue with the Court enforcing the express terms is that, they have to work out the good faith in the negotiation, but by doing this it means that the courts are at high risk of making the parties contracts for them. This creates the worry that the commercial stability in England would be threatened because it means party autonomy is not at the priority, as well, as freedom of contract. Both of these element are considered to be central to the English law, in relation to commercial law.", "positive": "aid aired b Don\u2019t chat to me\ud83d\ude21 hahahahah like Fuck off man Ahahaha I said straight aired nothing to say Nah bc remember I was saying I can\u2019t see how many likes like it just says and others but it said I could change it to see how many people like it Yeah, now I can because before it was always other s On both accounts Bring back Snapchat\u2019s 3 best friends Chaotic hahaha yeah hahahaha never dat Toxic never touched my bloodstream she said undisclosed info you do tbh But it\u2019s a good job you realised it though", "positive_attacked": "aid aired b Don\u2019t chat to me\ud83d\ude21 hahahahah like Fuck off man Ahahaha I said straight aired nothing to say Nah bc remember I was saying I can\u2019t see how many likes like it just says and others but it said I could change it to see how many people like it Yeah, now I can because before it was always other s On both accounts Bring back Snapchat\u2019s 3 best friends Chaotic hahaha yeah hahahaha never dat Toxic never touched my bloodstream she said undisclosed info you do tbh But it\u2019s a good job you realised it though", "label": 1}

{"id": "aug_691", "anchor": "Alpha oscillatory activity (8-13 Hz) is the dominant EEG rhythm in the awake brain. Initially thought to reflect cortical idling (Pfurtscheller, Stanc\u00e1k, &amp; Neuper, 1996), the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) suggests that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task-irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch, Sauseng, &amp; Hanslmayr, 2007). Supporting this, visual spatial attention tasks found a robust cortical response: when attention was directed to one hemifield via a directional cue, alpha decreased in the contralateral hemisphere (Sauseng, et al., 2005; Thut, Nietzel, Brandt., &amp; Pascual-Leone, 2006) and increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Worden, Foxe, Wang, &amp; Simpson, 2000; Kelly, Lalor, Reilly, &amp; Foxe, 2006), suggesting alpha oscillations were supressed in brain areas involved in active processing. Thus, alpha oscillations have emerged as an indicator of sensory supression and are proposed to play a pivatol, mechanistic role in attention by gating information flow to relevant sensory regions (Mazaheri, et al., 2014). The present study specifically analysed the effect of arrow cues proceeding stimulus onset on alpha oscillations. It is a partial replication of Sauseng, et al.\u2019s (2005) cued visual attention task, in which they found that alpha range amplitudes were lower in parietal areas involved in active processing 200ms before stimulus onset. In line with this, the hypothesis for this study predicts that when recording from P3 in the left parietal lobe, there will be higher alpha range amplitudes for the cue left than the cue right condition. Method Participants Thirty-nine undergraduate students volunteered to participate in the study after providing informed consent. One participant was not included in the analysis due to incomplete data. Design A within-subjects design was used. The independent variable was cue direction (with two levels: left and right). The dependent variable was alpha range amplitudes within the left parietal lobe in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). Materials The EEG alpha range activity was measured using BIOPAC MP36 and 3 electrodes. AC and Everi cream were used to apply electrodes. PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker. The cues included left and right arrows (as shown in figures 1a and 1b), which informed participants which hemifield to expect the stimulus. The stimuli included small and large white bars (as shown in figures 1c and 1d). Procedure EEG alpha range activity was recorded from 3 electrodes located at the sites of the standard 10-20 system (Trans Cranial Technologies, 2012). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz and a notch filter at 50 Hz was applied. The active electrode was attached to P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz and the earth was attached to the forehead near the hairline. These were measured relative to Cz. Electrode impedance was kept at &lt;10 k\u03a9. Participants were asked to perform a cued visual attention task. Figure 2 illustrates a typical trial sequence and time course of events. Each participant sat on a chair in front of a computer screen and completed a consent form. Then, the experimenter applied electrodes on the participant\u2019s scalp and gave them task instructions. Participants were told that a cue would appear to indicate which side of the screen to expect a stimulus, followed by a brief pause where they would attend to a central fixation cross. Then, a small or large bar stimulus would appear, and they would respond accordingly using the keyboard. Each participant performed 12 practice trials with feedback (3 blocks of 4 trials) to familiarise themselves with the task, followed by 80 experimental trials without feedback (20 blocks of 4 trials). Trial types (cue right small bar, cue right large bar, cue left small bar, cue left large bar) were randomised within each block. Each trial began with a central fixation cross presented on the screen for 800ms. An arrow cue, which pointed either left or right, was briefly presented for 35ms. The direction of the arrow indicates which visual hemifield the target stimulus would appear. After a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between 200ms and 1200ms (800ms for practice trials), a target stimulus was presented for 50ms. A random ISI prevented participants from anticipating exactly when each stimulus would appear. Then, an event marker was sent at stimulus onset. Different markers were sent for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli were either small or large white bars, presented on a black background. Participants responded by pressing the \u2018L\u2019 key if the bar was large and the \u2018S\u2019 key if the bar was small. Finally, the experimenter removed the electrodes and debriefed participants. Results Data treatment Event markers were sent from PsychoPy to Biopac to identify when stimuli were presented. The period 200ms before stimulus onset, after arrow cues had been shown, was analysed for cue left and cue right conditions. The raw alpha data was rectified to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. Rectifying converted all negative values to positive, to get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. Then, the data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of outlying values and smooth the data. The transformed data will be known as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA). Data analysis The normality of data was assessed. The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that the cue left (W = .83, n = 38, p &lt; .001) and cue right (W = .85, n = 38, p &lt; .001) conditions were significant. Therefore, the data was not normally distributed, and non-parametric statistics were used. Table 1 shows that median RAAA were .02 higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. A Wilcoxon signed-rank rest indicated that this difference was statistically significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .002). Discussion The results of the present study support the hypothesis that there is significantly higher alpha amplitudes for cue left than cue right conditions when recording from P3 in the left parietal lobe. These results are consistent with the AIH, as alpha activity was higher in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the cued direction of attention (Worden, et al., 2000; Kelly, et al., 2006) which indicates supression and disengagment of the task-irrelevant hemisphere (Klimesch, et al., 2007). Furthmore, these results are consistent with Sauseng, et al.\u2019s (2005) experiment, because from -200ms to stimulus presentation, there was stronger alpha suppression contralateral to the cued hemifield. Hence, the findings highlight the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations and their crucial role in gating attention through the inhibition of irrelevant information (Mazaheri, et al., 2014). Although the results clearly support the hypothesis, it is appropriate to recognise potential limitations. A first limitation concerns the distractive environment the experiment was conducted in. There were multiple groups working simultaneously in a lab on campus. Typical distractions included students chattering, experimenters speaking loudly and ongoing lectures. It is possible that these distracted and averted the visual attention of participants away from the task (Hughes, 2014). Therefore, future researchers must ensure that the study is conducted in a silent, non-distractive environment. Another limitation is that the present results cannot be generalised to the wider population. Studies found that cue-induced alpha lateralization was observed in younger, but not older adults (Hong, Sun, Bengson, Mangun, &amp; Tong, 2015). This suggests that younger and older adults may engage in different neural mechanisms of attentional orienting, and that the AIH is a phenomenon that diminishes through aging. Thus, further research must be conducted using a large, diverse sample of participants. Despite these limitations, one application of the present study is that individuals can be trained to enhance the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations. Kerr, et al., (2011) found that mindfulness meditation enhanced cue-induced alpha modulation. By improving people\u2019s ability to inhibit task-irrelevant information, they can be more effectively focus their attention. To conclude, the present research replicates Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) findings and contributes to a growing body of evidence to suggest that alpha range activity is supressed in areas of visual cortex involved in active processing. Despite limitations, the data are valid as they are consistent with previous research and theory. Therefore, the study provides clear support for the AIH being a robust cortical response.", "positive": "stem> cos it\u2019s taking long to download it oki okay x it\u2019s okay babes don\u2019t worry ab it, i\u2019m home now otherwise i would\u2019ve\ud83d\ude29 xx i\u2019ll see you another time though whenever you\u2019re freee i\u2019ll let you know once i have my schedule for next week cos i\u2019ve got an assignment due this xx yeah omg i was gna ask you just now, leggoooo x lemme see what parks are nice is it called ? which ones nicer this one looks good it\u2019s got a biggg lake there i think wait do u wanna get food first shall i meet you in", "positive_attacked": "stem> cos it\u2019s taking long to download it oki okay x it\u2019s okay babes don\u2019t worry ab it, i\u2019m home now otherwise i would\u2019ve\ud83d\ude29 xx i\u2019ll see you another time though whenever you\u2019re freee i\u2019ll let you know once i have my schedule for next week cos i\u2019ve got an assignment due this xx yeah omg i was gna ask you just now, leggoooo x lemme see what parks are nice is it called ? which ones nicer this one looks good it\u2019s got a biggg lake there i think wait do u wanna get food first shall i meet you in", "label": 1}

{"id": "aug_697", "anchor": "How can media be simultaneously supporting and endangering our democracy? In recent years, there has been a profound dispute regarding the institution of media and the part it plays for crippling ethical principles within a democracy. My argument in this essay is that both these processes have a pivotal role to play in facilitating and hindering societal growth. Regardless of these, we should work to fortify this institution as both factors are necessary for the growth of our democracy and this institution has a fundamental role to play in protecting the interests of all citizens as well as promoting equality. The power of media has been constantly viewed in terms of the ability of a single individual or group to enforce order and command authority over a vast number, enabling the entity to hold power over something like a media environment with ease (Freedman a 2014, pp.11). This resulted in weakening the public domain via undermining the autonomy and wide range of diversity that is necessary for democracy to take place effectively. As an example, take Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, who has an immense amount of power, control and influence, some might even say that it is unprecedented. The most troublesome element of Facebook is Zuckerberg\u2019s ability to manipulate and influence the data of two billion people (Hughes, 2019, pp.7). Over the years, Zuckerberg has accumulated a few companies such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The sheer amount of unparalleled control and influence that a single individual has is staggering. In addition, this immense level of power that Zuckerberg has at his disposal is unwanted and undemocratic. The reasoning being that such an extensive amount of power, no matter how good the intentions, does instigate corruption. There is the constant risk of using this kind of concentrated power, especially when left unchecked, for personal use and this, in turn, is dangerous (Freedman b 2014, pp.319-334). To put it into perspective Facebook uses the medium of media to get people to use its products. Then, they use the response of that individual to manufacture more data, making Facebook\u2019s ability to calculate what you will do in a situation pervasive and a threat to democracy. (Zuboff 2018, pp. 287-289). Furthermore, another detrimental effect of democracy is that it risks the wrong choice of public servant. In this regard, the election of Donald Trump is an apt example. As Facebook has one of the most advanced predictive systems in the world, Trump was able to use this to his advantage by using the analytic data collected by Facebook. There were able to connect the files of voters to individual behaviour and then show specific ads that correlated with their voting patterns. Since winning the election Trump\u2019s bizarre behaviour combined with his delusional ideas continually reinforces the fact that he is not fit to rule America and the main aid here was Facebook, which propelled the success of his election undermining the government (Bump 2018, p.1-2). Another factor is not adequately allowing individuals the right to vote. The devastating impact, which media has on our democracy is still present. Individuals can vote for individuals based on certain factors, such as how their ideology matches with the running candidate or something as fickle as admiring the appearance of the candidate. This can lead to bias where an individual is more likely to pick a candidate if their beliefs are aligned with theirs (Caselli, F 2007, pp1-3) These factors may not even have anything to do with how capable and well suited they are for the job. In the case of America, this worsened the fact that many states where Trump\u2019s opposition received their votes were \"slave states\". There was an agreement made in the US constitution where every enslaved individual would only count as 35ths of a person (Acharya, A et al 2015, pp.4-7). This meant that even if more votes were obtained by other political candidates they would count as lesser votes overall, reducing their viability. In addition to this, there are profound issues when it comes to the topic of elite ownership and media power. Many individuals in the ruling class vigorously compete for power and ownership, which include the self-regulating ability to overcome democratic blocks (Marx 2010[1867] pp.8- 11). These individuals, known as the elite of society, often have a significant role to play in the media and the various ways that individuals, by certain messages, are susceptible to whatever the outlet portrays. They can use the controlling stakes they have in companies to get across a message that they want or control elements of news programs, newspapers and magazines all to the detriment of the working class and the surrounding institutions of society. Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet and Rupert Murdoch to name a few individuals who have bought controlling shares in media outlets. Rupert Murdoch, it can be said that he simply has too much power over the British state. (Helm, T et al 2011, pp1). Between them, they own media companies such as the Washington post and the Wall Street Journal, only further emphasising how the elite can hinder democracy. A sizeable number of shares bought by an individual would leave a company\u2019s rule to one individual, especially with social media companies (Mills, C.W 1959:3-27). In this case, the media is hindering democracy since it is allowing certain individuals to misuse and manipulate public resources. This is because considering the amount of power that individuals can obtain over public and private sectors, to the point where they can influence and predict whom you vote for via subliminal messaging or manipulating your data to benefit their agendas. They can even go the extent of using your data to predict with a high degree of accuracy the way you will behave and the resultant impact on democracy. For example, the analytic data that Facebook collected and how it assisted Trump\u2019s election. The possibilities are innumerous as to how they can exert their power. As a result, unethical practices are perpetuated, and the consequence is even more power and control which leads to a vicious cycle whereby the elite act in favour of the action which will provide them with the most benefit. These processes cripple democracy and making it feel more like a bureaucracy. Alternatively, even though the media can hinder democracy, there are ways that the media can support it, even strengthening it. One of these ways is that it protects the interest of its members. Democracy is unique in the sense that it allows people to get personally involved within their government. One way to achieve this is through social media platforms. In this way, the public have a sense of autonomy and a voice to speak up for themselves as to how they would prefer the running of their country. The choice is solely theirs as to whom they would want to elect depending on a wide range of reasons. One reason could be they think about who could, in the best way, represent their interests as well as benefit the country. Thus, giving the people free rein to choose whatever they like which also means that they could choose to not vote at all if they so wish. Everyone\u2019s opinions, through their votes, are included. This is regardless of them being in the majority or not, which appeases the public and makes them more amiable to the idea of democracy (Caplan 2007, pp.3-7) Moreover, promoting equality positively is significantly beneficial to democracy. Through using a democratic system, which connects relationally with media, a person is free to explore differentiating arguments of the running candidates, a party\u2019s manifesto details and any other details they could ever want to know. The fairness of this process is further emphasised by the fact that, regardless of social or economic background, public opinion is given. Even if you are wealthy or poor, have a lavish or humble lifestyle, under democracy your rights to vote are equal. Media only enhances the available opportunities. As a result, giving the liberal opportunity to engage in a political process in which you feel inclined towards since in the pure sense of democracy there is no bias or favouritisms. The media, being the main means of mass communication, is an enabler for democracy as having more educated voters can lead to a more legitimate government. Due to this media encourages mass participation and extends the reach that democracy can have over a country. This is beneficial as the institutions surrounding society also get strengthened as a result of the positive and consistent messages being promoted (Parsons 1992[1951] pp.45-51).Additionally, as larger numbers involved within a democracy means that a fairer and more representative process can take place and having an unrestricted, educated and varied choice enhances this. Thus, as individuals can make an informed decision how they want to engage in democratic practices, there is a higher degree of transparency within the government and that encourages more trust and in turn, makes democracy as fair and just of a system as possible (Katona, 2015 pp.359-394) For example, during elections there are several messages given about institutions, using the medium of media, such as education and health care. These include ideas such as improving the levels of education by developing a better curriculum and allocating more resources to ensure that students have a better overall quality of learning. Also, regarding the health care system the promise of more nurses, to improve the quality of service. Via this method, individuals engage within their political environment more if they know they are going to benefit as a result. So, as the surrounding institutions that underpin society strengthen, society becomes more stable. These institutions work synergistically building momentum of one another to reach a common social goal, stability (Canon, W.B 1987, pp.170-176). Thus, making it unavoidable for democracy to improve as well. Within a country, the group with the power to govern a country and its business is the government. This entity uses the tool of media to aid them in bettering the quality of democracy for everyone and strive to withhold the principles that their position stands for, which include the responsibilities they have to their nation. To hinder the monopoly of authorities, democracy needs to flourish. The state assists with this as the elected leaders are only in power for a certain period, so it is in their best interest to enforce the successful delivery of their promised policies, which benefit the people as well as their tenure but only if they are willing to do so. They are varied ways and methods in which they monopolise authority, a few of these being price capping and quality regulation (Bourdieu 1991[1982 pp.242-245]).Without the latter businesses would continuously put prices higher at a competitive rate leading to a decline in consumer welfare as well as lead to inefficiency. With the former, they can check the provision of good quality service as leaving businesses to their own devices will result in reluctance to keep the standards high. All this resulting in more stable democratic institutions. Nonetheless, government institutions, like any other institutions, are susceptible to exploitation as the elected use their position to support their own agenda, often using illegitimate means to get ahead. Furthermore, a beneficial point for media supporting democracy is that the structure of democracy works to reduce exploitation by spreading out the power that the role gives through bodies or committees who oversee the individual making sure no one has overarching power over the system. It is the fact that this task allows for easy power distribution, giving an equal opportunity for all (G\u00fcndemir, S. et al. 2017, pp.34-41). Within the government, the component of freedom usually allows individuals to act however, they want so long it is not at the detriment of others. Inside the structure of democracy, the population is free to act in any way they desire to seek any result. However, legal barriers restrict them, as they cannot go out of their way to harm another without repercussions. This governing structure grants the opportunity to pursue different careers and opportunities as well as giving a genuine voice to the people. Media is the thing that encourages such diversity, as you are free to express your own opinion and determine many lifestyle choices. Neither the communication tool, known as the media, is all-knowing nor is it useless. This tool can be capable of a vast amount such as altering the state and nature of dynamic relations within society for the better alongside mistaking acts and events creating a strain within society (Corner, 2011, pp.27-30). (For example) Due to the reasons mentioned, media can be a force for progressive change as well as a hindrance. It is safe to say that the media has a pivotal part to play within society, serving a variety of functions, and has multiple uses. Previously, having seen that the media can help the development of democracy, via methods such as promoting equality and the interest as citizens, individual trust within this process increases. Moreover, knowing that the media has the capacity to obstruct democracy. I am going to propose the argument that the media can neither endanger nor support democracy because it does not hold any power in and of itself. This communication outlet is merely the space in which power resides (Castells, 2009, pp.193). Therefore, media is not the chief proponent but merely hosts the interplay of power, control and dominance. It opens a vast space where people can come and hold power in areas such as business and politics (Freedman a, 2014, pp.11). Communication networks are central to this process and are key sources in society for it to hold power. The media agents involved help to spread this diverse message and engage in this with the end goal of altering the nature of the state (Castells, 2009, pp. 302-3). The problem has never been determining media\u2019s influence with assisting or deteriorating the economic situation, it is more to do with who occupies and aggregates the larger sources of information and the amount of space they take within this network. Media\u2019s main strength comes from the intertwining of various communication networks such as business, finance etc. Media weakens by the absence of news existing in some form or another within this domain. If there is nothing to occupy the space, then the impact of media is lackluster (Castells,2009, pp.194-195). Media cannot hold power over individuals of its own accord, it requires the strategic implementation of information from a combination of areas compiled into one place which then goes on to infiltrate all elements of social life. Conclusively, the relationship between media and democracy is extensive and far-reaching. Power, being ubiquitous in nature, seeps into the depths of media outlets and political institutions such as democracy. The power of media transcends merely control and is something far more perplexing. Even though we can see ways that media can assist and hinder democracy, its actual role is far greater and bewildering. I propose that more research is needed into the true nature of media and the way that its role functionally relates to different institutions, as well as the devastating impact it can have on society.", "positive": "eberries Cheese Butter Can u tell to come now pls I just have slips of u tbh K Food will come by half 7 Listen for door pls Tell to come pls Okay I\u2019ll try my best hehe \ud83d\ude01 No I felt nice u see\ud83d\ude02 Just finished exam and yh it went well Thanks for asking \ud83d\ude02 No Hi no I\u2019m home but thanks for asking \ud83d\ude0a Maybe next time Bye Hi jeff Cos my internet was off like can u do this pls Questionnaire I need data for my project man \ud83d\ude14\ud83e\udd15\ud83d\udc94 I got a boo boo Tanks \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f Btw when u get this can u send me the pics of us in the matching balmain shirts thanks \u263a\ufe0f", "positive_attacked": "eberries Cheese Butter Can u tell to come now pls I just have slips of u tbh K Food will come by half 7 Listen for door pls Tell to come pls Okay I\u2019ll try my best hehe \ud83d\ude01 No I felt nice u see\ud83d\ude02 Just finished exam and yh it went well Thanks for asking \ud83d\ude02 No Hi no I\u2019m home but thanks for asking \ud83d\ude0a Maybe next time Bye Hi jeff Cos my internet was off like can u do this pls Questionnaire I need data for my project man \ud83d\ude14\ud83e\udd15\ud83d\udc94 I got a boo boo Tanks \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f Btw when u get this can u send me the pics of us in the matching balmain shirts thanks \u263a\ufe0f", "label": 1}

{"id": "aug_701", "anchor": "Rationale: March 2020 when universities, schools, jobs, and lifestyle was put on hold for a four-month national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact of COVID-19 on the populations mental health has been major. The lockdown meant people had to stay home and isolate from loved ones and family members. This led to people experiencing anxiety and depression as they could not go out and enjoy their social life (Cao et al., 2020). The action orientated analysis aims to derive the importance of investigating potential discourses surrounding the topic of COVID-19 impact on student\u2019s mental health. Discourse analysis is based upon a semi structured interview collecting qualitative data (Smith., 1995) and focused on the research question, students\u2019 attitudes towards the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. The interview schedule in the appendices shows the formation of this question and constructs potential discourses such as mental health, students\u2019 lives, and future impact. Discourse analysis was chosen as the appropriate form of analysis for this investigation in order to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which students discuss and express their attitudes on COVID impact on mental health and how powerful this subject matter is in today\u2019s society. Willig (2015) showed how discourse analysis is suitable for a range of topics in order to assess the language, thus why it is appropriate for this topic. For confidentiality, the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Ellie in this analysis. Results: Discourse 1- \u2018loneliness is killing us\u2019. Ellie understands the mental impact COVID-19 has had on the general population. This is shown when she describes some experiences faced during the pandemic. In this extract Ellie explains how mental health has been a huge topic of conversation during the pandemic. Ellie suggests that due to lockdown many people\u2019s health and mental wellbeing has been affected as they have been stuck indoors for many months with hardly any social interaction or without seeing any family members. \"organisations have signposted mental health really well\" (line 30-31) suggesting that other businesses have done a better job than the government has done in helping mental health. She also touches upon the fact that people in care homes have had it rough as for many months they have not seen their loved ones leading to loneliness and further mental damage. The discourse of mental health shows what impact COVID-19 has had on many lives in today\u2019s society. Ellie suggests that many people in the future may face social anxiety as they have been stuck indoors with no other social interaction heading to increased social anxiety when meeting people again or not knowing how to interact anymore. This portrays that Ellie knows what is going on around her and is aware of the mental hardship many are facing during these unforeseen circumstances, however she feels as though she does not know what to do to help others. Ellie develops this discourse as a lack of social interaction the older generation has faced during this pandemic has had a mental and physical impact on many peoples lives. She suggests that due to the pandemic people are stuck indoors and many cant visit relatives in care homes or their houses as its dangerous causing \"isolation and loneliness\" (line 13). Ellie also mentions that many people may have loved ones in care homes who they cannot go and visit or may have to see them from a distance. This suggests that Ellie is worried about how families would cope with not seeing loved ones for so many months and how the deadly disease of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia can play a huge role during this pandemic. Ellies use of language and expression shows how worried she is for many families in this situation especially at these uncertain times. Discourse 2- \u2018Students trapped indoors\u2019. The impact of COVID-19 on students has been a running discourse throughout the whole interview. \"students feel like they are trapped indoors they cannot live like a student\u2019s\". portrays the anger Ellie feels when it comes to her views on the impact of the pandemic on university students, as Ellie herself is a first-year university student, she has many strong views on this discourse. Here Ellie explains the impact of COVID-19 on students\u2019 lives. She explains how university social life is non-existent as students cannot \"mix with other households\" this can be inferred as social isolation as Ellie feels like she cannot go out and meet others away from her flat she feels trapped with the same people every day who may not share same interests as her course mates who she cannot meet. This discourse shows Ellies frustration of being kept indoors and locked down from having fun and also enjoying what is meant to be university lifestyle. She feels as though her \"nightlife has been diminished\" (line 40) suggesting a growing concern of social isolation and not able to enjoy their prime childhood. Many goes on to explain how many students have moved to different parts of the country for university without their parents or loved ones and then thrown into social isolation. This can be traumatising for students at such a young age adding to loneliness and many other mental health problems. You can infer from Ellies speech that she is not happy with the handling of the pandemic for university students as they have no support from the government and are left to survive by themselves (lines 28-32). Ellie explains how many students are affected in schools. With the lockdown in March many schools were closed therefore students were at home for many months without having any homework or learning. Ellie spoke about how children \"lost interest and concentration\" and \"struggled fitting into school\" showing that she empathises with pupils as education is the most important at this age in order to build a strong future. She goes on to explain how children could not see their friends or teachers who may be their support and their happiness leading to loneliness and scared to go back to school as they have a loss in routine (70-73). From this we can infer that children at schools miss the social life of talking to their friends and having that support network as are too young to understand the implications of this pandemic, they just want to enjoy with their friends. This can induce loneliness and social boredom which is not great at such a young age. Ellie develops this discourse of acknowledging the fact that students may be disadvantaged in the job industry as many students are on cheap labour and are working parttime for minimum wage. This means that students are more likely to be made redundant as firms may not be able to afford to keep them on during this pandemic. Ellie recognises the harsh impact of students losing their jobs can have an impact on their mental health as the stress and anxiety of not being able to work to afford rent or their lifestyle can be a huge impact. Discourse 3- \u2018uncertain future\u2019 Ellie develops the discourse of uncertain future during this pandemic as many people may have struggled to cope with this year in general mentally and physically. With many Highstreet business and shops closing down Ellie does not know what the future will hold. She questions how the government debt will be paid off if people cannot afford to pay taxes. Ellie demonstrates what the future will look like in her eyes. With the increased government borrowing Ellie is worried how that would be paid back and if she will be able to pay it back as she is worried, she may not earn enough money due to a lack in jobs and a shrinking economy. She is also concerned about the population\u2019s future mental health, and how the long-term effects of the pandemic will play apart. As Ellie is a student, she is also worried about her student debt going up even though the debt is high in the first place as university is all online. She feels that university is a scam and is not worth the 9k she pays for online lectures. Ellie understands that it will take time to build the economy and lifestyle again and that as mental health has been well signposted, spoken about and made a topic of conversation many people may bounce back stronger than ever while using all the support given (lines 90-95). This shows that Ellie understands what the future will look like after the pandemic is over and how many people may overcome this trauma. Conclusion In conclusion the discourses throughout the interview shows the scared uncertain and worried student expressing views on the pandemic that is currently damaging our lives and our mental health. The increase in loneliness, anxiety, and depression amongst individual during this pandemic needs to be made a topic of conversation. There is a lot of help out there. Students have been greatly affected by this pandemic especially first year students as they have missed out on social events like freshers where they have chances to meet new people and make friends. This already adds to the loneliness as many of the students have moved away from home with not knowing anyone at their university. Many recent studies on the impact of the pandemic on mental health support Ellies views as mental health is on the decline due to anxiety depression and loneliness impacted by the lockdown and the isolation (Cullen et al., 2020). This analysis was from one transcript, this may not be enough to be generalised to others as many people may have had different experiences of the pandemic therefore this can be different for every individual.", "positive": "I no longer would like to carry on with my application for .

Our suggestion to was that we could try and arrange presentations for all affected individuals on the of week 23 ( ) as this is only 3 days earlier than planned. This would allow us to all go on our trip and would be a fantastic option for us. I understand this would not be easy to arrange and I apologise for the inconvenience, but I believe the alternative is much more difficult and costly! Alternatively, if needs be we can cut our trip short and fund travel back to the UK for our members so we could be available on . This would have significant financial implications for us so would not be ideal but is a possibility if the presentations can be arranged on that date. Another option we have considered was sending in videos of us presenting, I am not sure how well this works with the exam regulations though.

{"id": "aug_727", "anchor": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that is widely identified as having impairments on communication and behaviour. The DSM-V refers to social-emotional reciprocity deficits, difficulties in maintaining relationships and deficits in non-verbal communication as diagnostic criteria for Autism (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Memory functions are another aspect of autism that are talked about frequently, in particular, with executive functions (EF). Studies have shown that autistic individuals (AI) struggle with EF. For example, Bennetto et al. (1996) compared AI to individuals that suffer from frontal lobe brain lesions (extensively known for memory impairments) and found that they scored similarly on standardised EF tasks, showing an impairment on their executive functioning. It is important to note that this study was conducted with high-functioning AI so may not speak for all on the spectrum, nevertheless it has been a prominent study in the field of memory and AI. Regarding gathering evidence from autistic witnesses (AW), a few studies have looked at their performance on line-ups, but a lot of the research has focused on formal interviews. The Cognitive interview (CI) is an interview method that significantly improves the detail and accuracy of witness reports across various witness groups and is used highly in the US and UK (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). However, research by Maras and Bowler (2010) found that when conducting the CI on AI, they were less accurate on all sections of the CI compared to the control of typically developing (TD) matched adults. Further study results also suggest that it isn\u2019t an efficient method of interviewing AW, therefore I will list out a few recommendations that may improve evidence gathering from AW in an interview setting. One key aspect in conducting the CI or other enhanced interviews is the \u2018context reinstatement\u2019. Fisher and Geiselman (1992) stated that context reinstatement requires witnesses to mentally return to the incidentcrime for access to the cues that are representative of the incident context. However, for AW and AI this does not seem boost accuracy or recall but in fact reduce their accuracy and lead to reporting more incorrect details (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). One explanation for this is that AI struggle with episodic memory and the relational binding of events. Bowler et al. (2014) presented this as they conducted a study with autistic participants and TD participants where they viewed coloured drawings in a grid. In one condition, they were asked to recall either the item, colour, or location of the drawing and in the other condition, they were asked to recall the item and colour or the item and location. Results showed that participants with autism did significantly worse in the second condition on both trials. The findings suggest that AI show diminished relational binding compared to TD individuals. However, Solomon et al. (2016) suggested it may not be a relational binding problem but rather the excess use of cognitive functions. Solomon\u2019s study into memory involved autistic adolescents compared to Bowler\u2019s adults which could suggest age-specific differences regarding relational binding. Maras et al (2014) argued that the self-administered interview (SAI) combated the caveats for context reinstatement and the social aspect of the CI. The SAI was developed by Gabbert et al. (2009) to initially preserve the memory of the incidentcrime soon after it occurs. Maras et al. used the SAI with AW and despite the perceived benefits, it did not increase the rate of correct details recalled. However, one aspect of the SAI that they found to be useful was the Sketch component as autistic participants found it easier to recall more details with drawing in relation to the event. Maras et al. suggested that this aspect of the SAI may reduce the cognitive demands on AI. To further support this, Mattison et al. (2015) conducted studies with the sketch reinstatement of context (Sketch-RC) and mental context reinstatement (MCR) on autistic children and TD children and found that autistic children in the Sketch-RC condition (which consisted of drawing everything they could remember from the earlier video they watched) did significantly better than the autistic children in the MRC condition. In this study by Mattison et al. the results only supported free recall so a further study (Mattison et al., 2018) assessed the same conditions also in a probed setting (cued recall) but found that autistic children still did not have higher accuracy or detail but they did make significantly fewer errors than autistic children in the MRC condition. Therefore, to aid AI and AW in investigative interviews, the results from these studies suggest that it may be worth adding a sketch element to interviews, especially with children, as though it may not make the largest difference in detailed recall, it can reduce the amount of errors made, leading to better information gathered for the police. One recent recommendation that is also based off improving the recall of AW is the Witness-aimed First Account (WAFA). The WAFA (Maras et al., 2020) is another method of alternate interviewing where AW self-direct their recall. They stated that while Sketch-RC and the CI use unbounded narrative recall, the WAFA uses segmentation.. During the WAFA study, both autistic and TD participants watched an intact narrative version and narratively scrambled version of a crime video in a WAFA and control interview condition. WAFA condition participants were asked to segment aspects of their recall through questions such as, what the most important part of the video was, or what else had happened. The interviewer then returned to the noted segments and asked the participant to recall what had happened for each segment mentioned, in the same order they mentioned them in. Maras et al. found that autistic participants recalled around 15% more correct information as well as TD participants compared to the control condition. However, autistic participants still recalled less than TD participants with the WAFA which leads to more uncertainty of why AW still can\u2019t do as well as TD individuals. Also, in the present study, the time between watching the two videos and conducting the interview was 30 minutes which is unrealistic in a real-life setting. A longer wait may reduce the \u2018effects\u2019 of the WAFA, as memory worsens over time or it could also surprisingly prove beneficial. Nevertheless, there is supporting evidence for the segmentation method that the WAFA uses. Zacks and Swallow (2007) talked about segmentation and suggest that the way in which individuals segment events can aid to remembering more and learning better, especially if their events have boundaries. Interestingly, a study into AI and perceiving actions by Zalla et al. (2013) found that among individuals that had to detect boundary transitions in events at \u2018fine and coarse\u2019 levels, autistic participants showed reduced accuracy compared to TD participants. These findings support the notion that AI struggle with detecting event boundaries in a traditional sense, which makes it more difficult to provide detail and accuracy in standard or CI. The WAFA appears as a good recommendation as though it requires further research (one of the first studies), it uses framework like Zacks et al. to try and use segmentation for aiding better recall in AI. A further component mentioned earlier, is the social aspect of interviews with AW. Again, it is explicit knowledge that AI have many social communicative deficits (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and one qualitative study conducted by Benford and Standen (2009) looked into how high-functioning AI and individuals with Asperger\u2019s preferred internet communication (IC). Participants in the study spoke about the idea of control with IC, such as control over time and how much time they spent on thinking. One participant mentioned that IC allowed her to not have to deal with the \u2018incomprehension and frustration\u2019 of a social encounter. The study does specifically involve high-functioning AI which again, may not be applicable to a wider autistic population, however the study acquired a large amount of detailed information as participants sent from 22-82 email postings back and the researchers were able to spend a while developing their conclusions. Although this study doesn\u2019t directly relate to witness interviews, the premises of it and other research into remote interviewing (see Nash et al., 2014) suggest that the use of technology in gathering evidence may add an element of comfortability for interviews, which can strengthen rapport and lead to a better investigation as a whole. This is shown as Collins et al. (2002) found among conditions of \u2018rapport\u2019, \u2018neutral\u2019 and \u2018abrupt\u2019 interviews, participants recalled more correct information in the \u2018rapport\u2019 condition without an increase of incorrect information but were also more willing to co-operate and \u2018try harder\u2019 for the interview. One very important factor in these recommendations is that individually, they may not seem to produce extremely yielding results but with more research, it can become clearer which aspects provide better information (such as the sketch aspect in the SAI) or even whether some techniques will work cohesively or not. To conclude, the first two recommendations aim to improve the recall provided by AW and both draw on the Task Hypothesis (Bowler et al., 2004) which suggests that AI have better recall when they are provided with more support on what they want to remember. However, autism is a spectrum disorder, indicating that individuals can be extremely diverse, much research into autism even shows the difference as majority of it looks in to high-functioning AI. Even so, the studies allow for base recommendations that can improve with more research. The last recommendation of using technology to better conduct interviews also requires more research in the field but can no doubt offer a more suitable approach for AW that struggle with the social component of interviews.", "positive": ", Thank you for this, I've accepted all the changes and have attached them back to you.

{"id": "aug_732", "anchor": "Dear CEO, With regards to your upcoming conference in Helsinki from the 2nd to 4th September, I have researched and identified the relevant itinerary items for your trip. - I have identified two potential accommodations within the \u00a3200 per night budget: 1. Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for \u00a3308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for \u00a3250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra \u00a316 per night (totalling \u00a3342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay. If you could please review my recommendations and let me know if you think they are appropriate so that I can pass them onto the travel department to do the booking.

{"id": "aug_735", "anchor": "Abstract Previous research has suggested that incongruent stimuli delays reaction times than congruent stimuli. In this study, participants were presented with words of colours and were asked to respond to the font colour. The words either matched their font colour (congruent) or were dissimilar to their font colour (incongruent). Their reaction time was measured in milliseconds (ms) across 60 trials and comparisons were drawn between the two conditions. The mean reaction time was 878.8ms for the congruent condition and 966.8ms for incongruent. This difference is significant. Introduction When performing the classic Stroop task, participants were asked to identify the colour of a printed word and ignore its meaning (Entel &amp; Tzelgov, 2018). The Stroop effect occurs when the written word (\"blue\") is printed in a non-matching font colour (red) which delays reaction time. The stimuli (words) are incongruent and reaction time is affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words. (Stroop, 1935; Braisby &amp; Gellatly, 2012; Grondin, 2016). Previous research has suggested that incongruent stimuli delays reaction times than congruent stimuli. There is literature that suggests that this is a consistent effect. Stroop (1935) compared the difference in time for reading words printed in black and coloured ink (2.3 seconds) then the difference in naming colours of the squares and font colour (47.0 seconds). Results from Stroop (1935) showed that reaction times slowed, by an average 110.3 seconds (Goodwin, 2010), when the font colour was different from the meaning of the word (for example, when \u2018red\u2019 was written in yellow ink) in comparison to naming the word in colour (43.3 seconds) - 67 seconds difference. Other studies have also shown this effect such as Datta, Nebhinani &amp; Dixit (2019). Datta et al. (2019) compared the difference in reaction times in three conditions (neutral, congruent and incongruent). The incongruent condition (condition 3), had participants reacting to both Hindi and English versions of the Stroop task where the words were written in both English and Hindi. The incongruent condition meant the name of the colour-word did not match with the font colour (Datta et al., 2019). The study had 42 participants and each condition of each language had 48 trials. Results from Datta et al. (2019) showed a mean of 1051.93 milliseconds (ms) in the English version incongruent condition which was 54.8 ms slower than the Hindi version in condition 3 (997.13 ms) and 151.63 ms slower when comparing to the English version in Condition 2 (900.30 ms). These researchers found that incongruent trials took longer to respond to than congruent trials, therefore the prediction for this study was that students would take longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than reacting to stimuli in the congruent condition. Method Design The experiment used a repeated measures design. The independent variable was congruency with two levels - incongruent and congruent. The dependent variable was reaction time measured in milliseconds. Participants Overall, there were 59 participants. All were Psychology Undergraduate students from Aston University and a volunteer sample, recruited through University comms. Apparatus and Materials Participants used personal computers to complete the experiment. This study used PsychoPy to collect data \u2013 an experimental software which recorded participants reaction time. The words used were \u2018Red\u2019, \u2018Green\u2019, and \u2018Blue\u2019 (See Figure. 3, Figure. 4 and Figure. 5). The font used was Arial, with the stimuli positioned in the centre of the screen at (0,0). The response options were keyboard arrow keys, left for \u2018red\u2019 ink, up for \u2018green\u2019 and right for \u2018blue\u2019. There were 10 reps to each 6 stimulus types, totalling 60 trials in blocks of 10. Procedure Participants gave consent to participate in the study and took part in the experiment individually. At the beginning of the experiment, participants received written instructions on their monitor. Participants read the instructions in their own time before pressing an arrow on the keyboard to begin the experiment. The instructions described what the participants were to do and which keys they would need to use to respond to the stimuli. (See Appendix 1 for full instructions.). The stimuli were presented on the computer in a random sequence, the words appearing singularly, on the monitor, centre-screen, and only disappearing when participants pressed an accepted key. The experiment ended when all 60 trials were completed. Results Table 1 shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent than colour congruent condition. Both SDs are high relative to the mean, this suggests the data may not be reliable as there are large within condition differences. However, a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant (T = 403.0 , N = 59, p&lt;.001). Discussion Conclusion The results are consistent with the hypothesis of this study and previous research, as participants took longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition \u2013 statistically significant. This suggests that reaction time was affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words when attempting to react to the colour (Stroop, 1935; Braisby et al. 2012; Grondin, 2016; MacLeod, 1991). Cohen, Dunbar &amp; McClelland (1990) would suggest that this also illustrates the way people process information and people\u2019s capacity for selective attention. Methodological Issues Due to the way the experiment was ran, participants completed the study not in a standardised environment, completing the study on the different computers or PCs in dissimilar environments. If this study were repeated, participants would use a standard University computer. Also, to verify the demographics of the participants to confirm the ratio of gender and age, as studies has found gender and age differences to response with the Stroop task. (\"What the Stroop Effect Reveals About Our Minds | Lesley University\", 2020). Further Research Further research could include changing the stimulus to test its effects on reaction time. For example, changing the word to be a synonym of the colour (changing red to crimson) or becoming an anagram (red to rde) - like Hintzman et al. (1972); Regan (1978). Alternatively, changing the colour to a random word (red to \u2018ask\u2019, \u2018monkey\u2019, \u2018heart\u2019, \u2018blood\u2019.)

{"id": "aug_737", "anchor": "Thank you for having visited Thrills and Spills LLP this morning. Can you make a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders? Wrongful dismissals arise when an employer unjustifiably breaches one or more fundamental terms in an employment contract, resulting in an employee suffering a loss of benefits. To be eligible to claim, three requirements must be met. As a \u2018Wildlife Cameraman\u2019 for Wildlife Wonders Limited, you meet the first element of being an employee. The second is that you must have been dismissed. An employer can constructively dismiss an employee by placing them in a position where they can no longer be expected to tolerate such treatment and as a result, they resign. To successfully argue this, you must demonstrate that Wildlife Wonders committed a fundamental breach and you resigned, at least partly, in response to it. Your job title and duties as a Wildlife Cameraman were reassigned by Narinder, without a consultation - this variation usually requires a mutual decision. Despite remaining in accounting for 6 months, your reluctance will demonstrate that you have not affirmed or accepted this change and that Wildlife Wonders have subsequently breached your contract. There is also a duty of mutual trust and confidence implied into every contract. A mere dispute cannot seriously damage the relationship between both parties. However, statements, such as Narinder\u2019s disrespectful and humiliating comments at the award ceremony, can. By resigning effective immediately the morning after the final incident, you can emphasise that your working environment was intolerable. The final requirement is that you must have suffered a loss by not receiving all of the benefits you were entitled to, as a consequence of Wildlife Wonders breaching your contract. If your contract has a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) clause, you would no longer be suffering a loss. This is important as it would invalidate a wrongful dismissal claim. Provided there is not one, and all other criteria is met, you can claim wrongful dismissal. Can you make an unfair dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders? As an employee for Wildlife Wonders, you have the right not to be unfairly dismissed. Unfair dismissals occur when employers fail to provide a fair reason, or fail to follow a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. You will satisfy the initial eligibility criteria for this claim, as you have been continuously employed for 10 years and are not part of an excluded class of employees. Next, you must show that you were constructively dismissed, which I have already covered. It is likely Wildlife Wonders would rely on your capabilities as their fair reason for dismissal. Poor performance and financial difficulty could also be argued as some other substantial reason. Capability references skill and aptitude, and you mentioned that you have failed to capture any decent footage for several years. Wildlife Wonders could subsequently argue that you are no longer competent in your position and are incapable of doing your job. Narinder has set you increasingly challenging projects, but this is irrelevant. Lastly, it must be determined if Wildlife Wonders acted fair and reasonably in treating the reason they provided as sufficient to warrant a dismissal. Tribunals will look at a range of responses that a reasonable employer might take; your personal attributes, such as your previous work record and excellent reputation, will be considered favourably. As a reasonable employer, Wildlife Wonders is expected to have inquired into a problem and considered alternative options before dismissing you. Narinder did not provide you with a consultation when she reassigned you, nor was she required to, but it is a factor that will weigh negatively when determining the reasonableness of her actions. What are the procedural requirements for wrongful dismissal? There are two venues in which you can bring a wrongful dismissal claim \u2013 A court or an employment tribunal. In an ordinary court, a part 6 form must be presented within 6 years of the dismissal taking place. The last day you can initiate a claim in this court is Wednesday 25th November 2026. An employment tribunal will require the completion of an ET1 form, that outlines the details of the claim along with the remedy you seek. I would encourage you to take this route. Unless not reasonably practical, three calendar months is the time limit placed on initiating proceedings. This is calculated from the day you terminated your employment and is known as the effective date of termination. This date cannot be fixed regardless of any prior agreement. In your case, it is Thursday 26th November 2020, meaning the last day you can submit a claim is Wednesday 25th February 2021. It is my recommendation that you act as soon as possible and do not wait until the time-limit has elapsed. What are the procedural requirements for unfair dismissal? An unfair dismissal claim must also be presented at an employment tribunal. Accordingly, the same claim form and time limits mentioned for employment tribunals under wrongful dismissal, apply. Prior to commencing unfair dismissal proceedings, you are required to contact the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), and attempt early conciliation. An additional month is added to the time limit in order to allow for this. A conciliation officer will seek to promote reemployment or a settlement between you and Wildlife Wonders, where it is just and equitable to do so. However, if they are unable to resolve the issue, a conciliation certificate will be issued, allowing you to proceed with your claim in a tribunal. What are your prospects of success? The burden is on you to prove you are eligible to claim wrongful dismissal. There is no defence that Wildlife Wonders can depend on, other than disproving your eligibility. Constructive dismissal can be difficult to prove and they are likely to challenge this element. The legal test applied is whether someone in the same position as yourself, would view Narinder\u2019s actions as an intention to abandon the contract. Considering she disregarded your job title and duties when transferring you to the accounting department, and followed it with no discussion or explanation, it would be fair to assume this intention was sufficiently clear. A court or tribunal is interested in what triggered your resignation. The \u2018final straw\u2019 you mentioned in our meeting, Narinder disrespecting and publically humiliating you, will be the focus here. Alone, it is unlikely to be sufficient to justify your resignation. However, you\u2019re entitled to rely on the totality of her actions. Therefore, this in conjunction to her variating your contract terms, will allow you to succeed in a wrongful dismissal claim. Your prospects with an unfair dismissal claim will depend on whether Wildlife Wonders can prove the reason and procedure they undertook for dismissal was fair and reasonable. As I mentioned previously, your inability to capture decent footage over the last 2-3 years, could be accepted as a fair reason. The size and administrative resources of the company will be relevant to the outcome, as their loss of confidence in your abilities could be consequently seen as a fair response. Despite this, small companies are not excused from following proper procedures. Moreover, If Narinder was dissatisfied with your capabilities, then she should have followed ACAS guidelines on how to address the problem. Instead, she repeatedly avoided and ignored your requests for explanations. As such, it is likely that Wildlife Wonders will successfully argue their reason for dismissal as being fair, however, they will struggle to convince a tribunal that their procedure was reasonable. What are your options and what are the advantagesdisadvantages of pursing each one? Option 1: Apply to ACAS and seek a settlement The advantages include saving the time, aggravation and cost of claiming. You will also, hopefully, be listened to by Wildlife Wonders and have an opportunity to negotiate on the matters most important to you, for instance the company car. The disadvantages are that a settlement might not be reached and you will have to endure the process of claiming on top of adhering to the early conciliation process. Furthermore, you may inadvertently reveal your deep interest in the company car to your hindrance. Option 2: Claim wrongful dismissal The advantages include receiving - without having to earn them - all benefits you\u2019d have received had you worked your notice period. The disadvantages are the cost and aggravation of claiming and being out of work with no regular salary, coupled with the stress of seeking alternative employment. Option 3: Claim unfair dismissal The advantages are the same as for option 2, but you may also be offered reemployment, which would save the loss of salary and stress of seeking alternative employment during a pandemic. The disadvantages are the same as for option 2. My considered advice re the best option I feel option 3 would be the most beneficial to you, as this is where you\u2019ll be best compensated for your current circumstances. However, it is crucial that you reflect and make this decision yourself. What remedies are available to you for wrongful dismissal? Three types of remedies are available to a successful wrongful dismissal claimant \u2013 I believe the one most relevant to you is financial compensation. You will be restored to the position you would have been in, had Wildlife Wonders performed their contractual obligations. Only the losses that are reasonably foreseeable can be recovered. A tribunal\u2019s award for wrongful dismissal is capped at \u00a325,000. This is something to keep in mind when deciding which venue to initiate a claim in. You will be compensated for all of the benefits you would have been entitled to, had you worked their notice period. Your contract offers you only 8 weeks\u2019 notice, however, you are legally entitled to 10. For loss of salary, Wildlife Wonders will be ordered to pay 10-weeks\u2019 worth of your net pay - \u00a310,000. For your untaken holiday, you will be paid in lieu \u00a34,000. I will be consulting a pension specialist to estimate the value of your pension entitlement. As you have access to a final salary pension scheme, you will be compensated generously. This is because it is almost impossible to find new employment offering this comprehensive package. You won\u2019t be compensated for benefits that your employer is not contractually obliged to provide. Yet, you may still be entitled to your Christmas bonus, despite the word \u2018discretionary\u2019 being used in the clause. I understand you would like to retain possession of the company Land Rover. Were the weekend trips you described for personal or work purposes? If you can prove you used the vehicle in your private life, then you might be able to keep it. I would advise you not to reveal to Wildlife Wonders your strong desire to keep the car, or this will be used against you during negotiations. Unfortunately, no award is issued for injury to feelings or for the manner in which you were dismissed, even though Narinder shaming you in front of industry professionals might make it harder for you to get another job. What remedies are available to you for unfair dismissal? A tribunal could make you an order for reengagement. I am aware that you are adamant you will never work for them again and a tribunal would not recommend this remedy if it is likely to promote further issues. However, there is no harm in knowing all of the options available to you. Under this order, you would be offered suitable or comparable employment to what you had prior to your dismissal. Should you wish, you could resume your previous position as \u2018Wildlife Cameraman\u2019. Non-compliance by Wildlife Wonders, allows the tribunal to increase your award by up to 25%. Financial compensation for unfair dismissal consists of a basic and a compensatory award that are summed together. The basic award is a precise figure and compensates you for the loss of job security. In your case, the total amount a tribunal will offer you here is \u00a36,456. For the compensatory award, tribunals determine what would be fair to award a successful claimant by assessing any loss deriving from the employer\u2019s actions in the dismissal. You cannot receive an amount higher than your gross salary, thus, the maximum amount available to you for this compensation element is \u00a378,000. You will be compensated for the immediate loss of benefits you are entitled to receive, between the dismissal and the date of the hearing. The current wait time is roughly 38-weeks, and it\u2019ll likely rise due to the Covid-19 crisis. This will subsequently increase the value of your award. Your future loss is also calculated for the period between the end of your notice period and the time it takes you to find new employment. A tribunal will likely compensate you for a considerable amount of time, as the current pandemic will make it more difficult to find new employment. The same calculations as wrongful dismissal applies here, for your bonus and other fringe benefits. Although, your pension value will additionally encompass both the loss of your current position, and the loss of future pension opportunity. As such, you\u2019ll receive a higher pension amount for unfair dismissal. Furthermore, should your employer fail to follow ACAS, an increase of up to 25% could be made to the value of your award. Similarly, if you fail to do so, then up to 25% can be deducted. In addition, if Wildlife Wonders fail to make payment within 42 days of an order being issued, interest be payable on all tribunal awards, further increasing your total compensation amount. You have an obligation to take steps to lessen and reduce the loss you accumulate as a result of your dismissal from Wildlife Wonders. I therefore encourage you to make a real effort in seeking alternative employment and keep a record of all job applications and responses. You\u2019re not expected to accept less favourable terms, unless you\u2019re unemployed for a considerable amount of time, in which case it reasonable to accept an inferior position. You can recover any expenses reasonably incurred in mitigating your loss; this includes the cost of newspapers to search for jobs, and even the cost of relocating. Needless to say, please keep your receipts. If Wildlife Wonders can convince a tribunal that the dismissal was to any extent caused by you, then a deduction will be made. Tribunals will take a broad, common sense view when assessing this deduction, and your poor performance is unlikely to be sufficient to satisfy the necessary culpable or blameworthy element. Other information I feel is relevant It would be helpful if you could email me a copy of your contract, so that I can check any further benefits you may be entitled to. I will also need to confirm whether or not there is a PILON clause, which would prevent you from claiming wrongful dismissal. In the meantime, you need to check with Wildlife Wonders\u2019 HR department to see if you have opted out of the working time regulations. If you have, you\u2019ll forfeit your entitlement to untaken holiday and your compensation amount will be reduced. Please email or write to Wildlife Wonders confirming your resignation and the reasons for it. I stress that no further action can be embarked on until you have taken this step. Failure to do so will invalidate any claim available to you, as you will not have been properly constructively dismissed. If you wish to discuss any questions, please do not hesitate to telephone me. I will contact you at the end of next week, on Friday, to discuss further instructions after you have had time to reflect. Yours sincerely,", "positive": ", I can only apologise.

Thank you, Hi, I have previously written to you asking if there was any chance to cancel the room due to the TP2 update that there will still be no teaching online. Now that we are in a lockdown again for the foreseeable, and after last year being able to cancel your accommodation as a result of this, I wanted to ask if anything had changed. Money and mental health are two massive issues in my life right now, and being able to cancel my accommodation would be incredibly helpful. I have been in the room for 4 days since the start of term, and this room could be put to so much better use by another tenant as I am likely not going to come back to university this year due to the current conditions. Moreover, should I use my room, I would be coming from a low risk area into a high risk, and due to having to be at home due to my care rule for a family member, this would be highly dangerous for myself and others. I understand that your protocol isn\u2019t to let people just come out of tenancy, but is there any way there could be an exception under the current circumstances of the world; this isn\u2019t exactly a normal year. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Hi , I hope you\u2019re well. I just wanted to ask a question about the assessment for the module. I saw that you are meant to put your text as an appendix.

{"id": "aug_749", "anchor": "The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the enforcement of drastic social distancing measures, which affect the ways in which students interact and socialise with one another. These measures conflict with the human instinct to connect with others, thus increasing social isolation and feelings of loneliness within students (Bavel, et al., 2020). This affects their wellbeing both directly, towards poor mental health and indirectly, as the underpinning reason behind the huge reduction in social interaction that students must now deal with (Burns, Dagnall, &amp; Holt, 2020). The objective of this research is to gain an insight into the importance of social interactions on the wellbeing of students, and how this has been impacted due to Covid-19. The main research question was therefore: \u2018How have changes in the amount and quality of social interactions due to COVID-19 impacted the well-being of undergraduate students?\u2019. Through this, a semi-structured interview was developed, which aimed to investigate the experience of changed social interactions, the impact this had on participant wellbeing, and their experience of coping mechanisms. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as a suitable method Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) has been chosen as the most appropriate methodology for this research topic because it is concerned with the detailed examination of the participant\u2019s personal lived experience (Willig &amp; Stainton Rogers, 2017). Analysis 1 \"It\u2019s overwhelming and draining\": negative impacts on wellbeing This superordinate theme explores the significant physical and psychological toll Covid-19 has taken on Feya, fostering a sense of powerlessness. She discusses the loss of control, predictability and security within her life during these unprecedented times. 1.1 \"\u2026I don\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel\": depressive symptoms Here, Feya uses a metaphoric expression, of being in a tunnel with no light, to illustrate the sense of loss of control she feels over her life and the feeling that there is no way out of this ordeal. She sees no light, which otherwise symbolises hope, at the end of this dark, perpetual tunnel, that is her mind. This is further supplemented by her mention of feeling \"trapped\", which implies that she feels imprisoned by her own thoughts and is looking for an escape. Feya appears to be discontent with life and tired of \"staring at the same four walls everyday\". This is reiterated when she states that she is \"living the same day, every day\". She feels stuck, defeated and hopeless. This creates a powerful, cyclical imagery of her depressive thoughts as being inescapable, as she goes over the same worries over and over. \"\u2026I feel really lonely, and a bit depressed and sluggish [\u2026] I feel like I\u2019m locked in a box.\" Feya talks about the negative emotions felt amidst lockdown restrictions. The box Feya describes is a metaphorical representation of the confinements within her own mind, as well as the physical confinements within her home. She highlights being mentally drained and avidly waiting for lockdown to come to an end. Feya\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018mentally drained\u2019 implies she is emotionally depleted and burnt-out due to the accumulation of stress in her personal life. In addition, Feya reiterates her fear of being \u2018lonely\" later on, saying \"I feel like you have to go out and see people, otherwise [\u2026] you\u2019ll drive yourself crazy\". This conveys her anxiety of being left alone to fight all of these overwhelming feelings by herself. The loneliness makes her feel vulnerable. Feya describes the bodily symptoms of depression, such as a loss of appetite and insomnia, which denotes how her feelings have clearly wreaked havoc on her physical wellbeing: \"When I\u2019m drained, my appetite disappears, I can\u2019t sleep and my mood\u2019s just dull\" Feya describes the sudden, erratic nature of her sadness. The way her appetite \u2018disappears\u2019 without warning suggests that symptoms are unpredictable and out of her control. Her inability to sleep shows how overwhelming this experience is, as her mind is constantly racing with negative thoughts, to the extent where she feels disorientated. The use and repetition of the verb \u2018drained\u2019 connotes a powerful imagery of a pale, empty shell of a person, highlighting the invasive, destructive effects as a result of being in isolation. 1.2 \"I\u2019ve been so anxious about the future, because life as we know it, has changed\": anxious symptoms Within this superordinate theme, Feya alludes to her apprehensions about what the future holds post-pandemic. She is filled with apprehensions and worries. Feya talks about going through a \"really uncertain time\", most of which revolves around her professional and personal life. She expresses an unknowingness of \"all of this is going to be over\". The pronoun \u2018all\u2019 denotes that the current crisis has impacted every aspect of her life. It depicts the true extent of the impact of Covid-19. Feya expresses how powerless she feels: \"We can\u2019t plan things out anymore\" Feya refers to the lack of control she feels, as her \"many plans and aspirations\" have been compromised. The use of the collective pronoun, \u2018we\u2019, denotes a sense of unity and acts as an attempt to regain a sense of control. It provides Feya with a sense of reassurance, that she is not the only one going through these hardships. She paints a picture of herself as being powerless, with no choice but to surrender to the virus. This is further exacerbated when Feya appears to be thinking out loud, searching for the answers to her many questions: \"Are we going back into lockdown, are we not, can we go into work, can we go to restaurants and see our friends?\" Feya is clearly stuck in her ruminations, which is an expression of her doubt and uncertainty regarding what the future holds. Feya describes the significant psychological distress she faced, induced by the abrupt nature of lockdown restrictions: \"I- I- I was really scared and cautious and careful\" The repetition of \"I\", where Feya appears to stumble over her words, sounds robotic and reflects how overwhelmed she felt at the time. There is a strong sense of fear and anxiety, depicted through her selection of words. 2 \"I felt so distant from them\": changes in social interactions This superordinate theme reflects the changes in Feya\u2019s social habits and ways of social interaction. Feya describes feeling not only physically distant from her friends, but also emotionally. She complains about how they \"wouldn\u2019t even be awake at the same time\", which creates a barrier that even digital interactions can\u2019t overcome. She feels emotionally detached and isolated, indicating a clear disconnect with the outside world due to the Covid-19 crisis. This is further emphasised when Feya talks about losing the ability to socialise, saying she had \"forgot what it was like to even talk to friends\", which implies that being in social isolation had stifled her. 2.1 \"With your immediate family members who you\u2019re living with, you get sick of and start bickering\": interpersonal tensions Here, Feya states how confinement with family members in her household has led to inevitable interpersonal tensions, as a result of stress and spending so much time together. The verb \u2018bickering\u2019 implies that they argue over trivial matters, which suggests that her \u2018dull\u2019 moods not only impact her own wellbeing but are also displaced onto others. 2.2 \"If it wasn\u2019t for social platforms, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do\": shift from physical to digital communication Feya describes social media as being an essential tool used to stay in contact with her friends and family. She explains that maintaining ties has \"moved from a physical form [\u2026] to a digital form\" and that everyone is just \"a call away\" now. Though she expresses her gratitude for these platforms, she says it does not compare to face-to-face contact. This emphasises how important physical connection is to Feya \u2013 it\u2019s a love language, which makes her feel \u2018alive\u2019 and connected. 3 \"I\u2019m pretty distracted most of the time\": coping mechanisms amid pandemic The final superordinate theme portrays how Feya is coping with the pandemic. Feya talks about being a key-worker alongside a university student, so she feels that she hasn\u2019t felt the impacts of the pandemic as severely as others. The adjective \u2018distracted\u2019 suggests she hasn\u2019t truly dealt with the impacts of the pandemic, instead she has diverted her attention and energy towards studies and work to avoid reality. 3.1 \"I\u2019ve just got to get on with it really\": acceptance Here, Feya\u2019s tone implies that she is ready to accept the uncontrollable nature of the Covid-19 virus and wants to proceed forward with her life, despite the turmoil it has caused. Acceptance is where the power lies, as Feya is able to find the control that she had previously lacked. 3.2 \"It\u2019s enjoyable, it\u2019s what life is about really\": maintaining close ties Here, Feya insinuates the importance of interpersonal connections through her use of language. She uses words which highlight the warmth that she feels in the company of her friends and describes how her mood \u2018brightens up\u2019 in their presence. She denotes the importance to continuously attend to and nurture her relationships in order to live a meaningful life. She talks about how seeing her friends has had a really positive impact on her mental health. She adds that she doesn\u2019t feel \"as alone\" in their company, which shows how social interactions provide a sense of unity, ease and comfort. They provide her with reassurance that she\u2019s not the only one going through these difficult times. Conclusion Dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the social connectedness and wellbeing of Feya. She defines her experience of lockdown as being overwhelming, draining and uncertain, as a result of social distancing measures, university closures and reduced social contact. During the course of the interview, we see a shift from frustration to acceptance of the global pandemic, as she is forced to come to terms with reality.", "positive": ", My name is ; I'm emailing to introduce myself and say hello.

{"id": "aug_752", "anchor": "Regarding the information I have gathered for the CEO's trip to Helsinki, I have managed to find a multitude of things ranging from hotels to souvenir shops for her children. To start of with, the hotel I thought would be the best fit is the Radisson Blu Seaside Hotel, due to the fact it overlooks the scenic Gulf of Finland. The hotel further has access to gyms, saunas and serves traditional and fresh food, only for \u00c2\u00a374 pn. It is only 1.8 miles from the centre. The next place I found for the CEO to have breakfast was Karl Fazer Caf\u00c3\u00a9, where they serve cinnamon buns and all sorts of savoury foods. It is local to the Hotel, being a 7 minute walk or a 5 minute car ride. Next, when looking at museums to explore, 2 stood out. One being, Sea Fortress Suomenlina. This stood out as it is near water, which is what Helsinki is known for, the sea, diverse architecture and their word famous designs. This sightseeing should be around 2-3 hours, and has many castles to visit including historical castles. The second was the Island and Open Air museum, this is more outdoor and is populated by many restaurants. This museum has been described as 'breath-taking', which is why it is also one that stood out. In regards to the souvenir shop, Kankufin Tapa was the highest rated one. This was because of the small homemade souvenirs, which can be easily to transport from different countries. For entertainment purposes, G-Livelab is the best place to go for live music, and for jazz. There is an event happening on the 4th September. Lastly, in relation to food, the restaurant that was highly rated was Kanstan Moljo.

Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made a big impact on me and my family. For my well-being, I have had to move to from my family home in . I apologise in advance for the lengthy email. I just wanted to confirm whether my decision is okay. So, what I can understand from the university updates via email is that term 1 (Second year of university - ) will consist of mainly online teaching but some on-campus learning. I wanted to know and confirm whether it would okay for me to stay here and continue with my online learning here in . In regard to on-campus learning, I would make use of the resources available online and make my tutors also aware. For example, if there are seminars I would do the work and reading notes electronically and then send them to my seminar leaders and interact with students I know from that class but online instead. This way the University does know I am continuing with my studies. Or if there is any group work, I could communicate with group members online via emailtextSkype. And if I had to come onto campus to present or any other important reasons I could travel to for a week. There are options for me transferring universities or taking a year out however for my own self I do love going to because it is a great way of distracting myself and I love the environment. Hopefully, for only a short period things at home in are not good and I thought I would stay in with my relatives that live here and they are supporting me and keeping me distracted.

{"id": "aug_768", "anchor": "Employment relations is a process of socio-economic exchange, and involves a individual performing service or duty in exchange for payment. Employment relations looks at the different aspects of a relationship between an employee and its employer. Employment relations have a major impact on the UK labour market, this statement is supported by ONS report on the UK labour market which shows from November 2017, there are approximately 32 million people at work with more than half being employed. The UK government is crucial with regards to employment relations to ensure they are able to meet the key goals of the country. The government acts as the economic manager, this consist of setting the level of wages, tax rate and managing the cost of living. The government are also classed as regulators of labour markets, this involves initiating new laws and regulations that have an impact upon the relationship between employer and employee. In addition, they play act as the welfare state, ensuring they are able to aid those who have been made redundant or struggling with financial difficulties. Being the largest employer with 5.39 million workers employed, the government sees itself as a eloquent employer and wants to show private sectors how to do this. This report will look the role the government plays with regards to gender equality in the UK. There has been an improvement in the amount of females in the labour market. Since the beginning, there has always been more men employed them women. The office of national statistics shows during the third quarter of 2020, 78.6% of men were employed opposed to the 71.9% of women who have been employed, a difference of just under 7%, this is near enough the lowest the difference has ever been and is a huge improvement considering the gap was 11.5% ten years ago. These numbers have however been affected heavily by the covid-19 pandemic. The employment rates of males has remained around 70%, however females have increased immensely. Since the great recession in 2008 in which women employment was roughly 67%, women employment has increased by around 5%. ONS suggests that women employment was at an all time high in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic of 72.6%, showing a positive change from 52.8% in 1971. The changes in state pension age for women has had a slight impact on this increase meaning less females retiring between the ages of 60-65. This increase in the number of women in the labour market has initiated a positive attitude towards the support of gender equality. There are several reasons for the growth in numbers of females in the workforce, one huge reason is the government acting as regulators of labour markets and initiating laws, these laws include the lone parent income support and equality act 2010, equality and human right commission, employment act 2008 and equality act 2006. From the start of 2008 to 2010, male employment rate went down by 4%, whereas for females just under 2% due to so many being made redundant. The years following the UK recession saw a loss in numbers of female full time workers, but an improvement in the number of part time employees. Fortunately, since the end of 2012 the full time employment has grown. During recession, many organisations recruited part time workers and full time workers were made redundant to help with labour costs and still have the same productivity from employees. This process is referred to as labour market flexibility, (Bell and Blanchflower, 2010). And is a process that the state were supportive of to help get the labour market back to the equilibrium, and was beneficial for part time employees. To have a greater effect, the UK government should have implemented a different strategy in order to support all those affected with the great recession. Despite many efforts for many years, gender equality is still a major and worldwide issue within the workplace. The global gender gap report 2020 stated there are \"massive inequalities in almost all of the UK\u2019s fasted-growing job clusters of the future\", this is a worrying stat as in order to sustain an effective workforce in the future, it is crucial that women are able to access resources that would aid the upbringing of children, inevitably the future labour market. Improvement in gender equality in the workplace with regards to the opportunities available, would allow women to contribute and support the UK economy. A study conducted by PwC (2020), suggests \"steps have been made towards advancing gender equality, however progress is slow\". This statement comes from results showing that the UK\u2019s position remaining at 16th however still doing better than OECD average. Another major and insightful fact from this study reports that if the UK were able to achieve the same level of female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by a staggering $252 billion. This supports the importance of allowing women the same opportunities and resources as men and pushing the gender equality agenda, because of the great impact it could have on the UK economy. An article written by the guardian states, \"the UK has fallen from 15th to 21st\" with regards to being the most equal nation. Although there has been progress in the number of women in the labour market, the UK are still far below its European neighbours with the gender equality rankings and shows that gender inequality is still of a major concern. Another major dilemma within the workforce is gender pay gap which supports the gender inequality regime. 8,424 private sector employers reported their data, with 3,746 employers noticing their pay gap improve whilst 3,387 seeing pay gap worsen, and 645 employers seeing no change. This supports that the statement that gender equality is still an issue. However, with regards to part-time employees women on average earn more, a possible reason for females earning more in part time field is it gives them flexibility to complete other commitments meaning more women doing part-time and higher earnings. The state of UK has played its role with the improvement in the gender pay gap with the policies and laws that have been legislated. Companies with more than 50 employees are now required to execute an equal pay audit, this identifies any differences in pay between men and women doing equal work. As an employer, doing an audit shows your dedication to remove any unfair pay. This comes as a part of the equal pay act 2010, which came into force to give both men and women a right to equal pay for equal work and has been implemented to protect people from discrimination. In 2017, it was compulsory for any company with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gap report, this comes as change as originally companies could publish this voluntarily. A negative to this law is that it is only compulsory for companies to report, however not actually make amendments to the pay gap. Since the beginning of gender pay gap being analysed, this issue has still not been resolved and could still be a problem for the foreseeable future, this comes as a result of the lack of determination from the UK government to resolve this issue. To help minimise gender pay gap and to resolve the issue of pay inequality, national minimum wage was enacted as a plan. This is significant as this was the UK governments\u2019 first national and cross-sectural attempt to regulate low pay. Dube (2017) found that in America for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, over the long run, the poverty rate is expected to decline by 5.3 percent, this emphasises the importance of minimum wage. In 2016, national living wage was implemented to help and support females in the workforce, however with the increase of the minimum national living wage by 4.9% in 2019, nearly 3 million children are still in poverty with parents who are at work. This proves that it is still of a major concern. Women make up 60% of workers on the national living wage, meaning at least one third of females are not on a wage that they could live on. The Fawcett society also mentioned that increasing the minimum wage to the real living wage, would help in resolving the gender pay gap issue. With regards to public sector, the government are doing there best to set an example to private sector companies, this is evident as an article from the public finance states that based on the number of employees in the senior government roles, UK is top in the EU and only fourth in the G20 nations. Presently, the gender pay gap amongst all employees in the public sector is 15.5%, which is a slight improvement, as in the last decade the gap has increased by roughly 4%. The most recent data conducted by ONS was in 2018, and suggests there has been an increase of 10.9 percentage points from 31 march 2008 to 31 march 2018 which at that point was 42.7% of female employees working at senior civil service level. This is a positive sign and shows gradual improvement year by year. In the executive officer and administrate responsibility levels, there are more females then male employees. Females still dominate with the number of civil service employees, however decreased by 0.1% from 2018 to 2019 which is not a positive sign. To prevent gender inequality occurring within the public sector, the government have enacted public sector equality duty. PSED \"requires public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity\" (Fredman, 2011).and ensure good relations between employees. This act requires public authorities to published quality objectives every four years as a minimum, also information to show they are cooperating with the public sector equality duty. PSED has yet to accomplish the goals it was set out to perform, as gender inequality is still present within the public sector. ONS shows that gender pay gap still exists amongst all of the professions within the public sector, showing more still needs to be done to resolve gender inequality. This affects the government\u2019s stance as aiming to be a role model, and portrays a negative image for the private sector employers. The UK government has attempted to find the perfect solution for gender inequality and has done this through various techniques including creating new laws to tackle the issues. There are still many issues occurring presently such as , gender pay gap, the number of females in the higher positions in contrast to males, the significant amount of women who are not on a wage that they could live on. One major law that was implemented by the government which was crucial was the Equality act 2010, this was a good intervention is helping with equality, however both males and females being represented equally still seems to be on concern. Equal pay has gradually been improving, however still seems a long way from the end goal, a solution to this could be a stricter approach towards companies like setting deadlines, ensuring equal pay becomes a priority for companies. To help with the millions of females who struggle to earn a wage to live on, the government should make this a priority by encouraging organisations to pay the real living wage and to make it mandatory. The national minimum wage is a positive for low pay workers (which is dominated by females), however there are still millions who earn less than the real living wage. Therefore the government need to implement new strategies to tackle this. The positions of more authority within organisations still have majority of men as the employees, the government should encourage females to apply for these higher positions by showing other women who have been able to become employees of these top positions, this could be used as motivation for females to feel that they are also able to achieve these roles. It is vital that the skills and potential of women in the UK are used to a maximum, as mentioned previously if the UK were able to reach the same female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by $252 billion, which would help decrease the gender pay gap and boost the economy significantly. This shows if the UK government are able to fulfil their roles efficiently as the biggest employers, and regulators of labour market, they could definitely help with gender inequality in the UK", "positive": "hink someones done black magic on liverpool uno As long as klopp stays manager idc That was rhe funniest \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 he heard a bang when barkley kicked the thin Loool kabak was a beast last night quality performance Loool serena shud be playing with men Nadal will have to win french open now said ur shook off 12 cupcakes 24\u00a3 i think Loooooooool they can suck it U bluddy put ur name down first u pos The goals app takin the piss with my transaction, so ima send u \u00a33.25 and then u put it in alright?", "positive_attacked": "hink someones done black magic on liverpool uno As long as klopp stays manager idc That was rhe funniest \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 he heard a bang when barkley kicked the thin Loool kabak was a beast last night quality performance Loool serena shud be playing with men Nadal will have to win french open now said ur shook off 12 cupcakes 24\u00a3 i think Loooooooool they can suck it U bluddy put ur name down first u pos The goals app takin the piss with my transaction, so ima send u \u00a33.25 and then u put it in alright?", "label": 1}

{"id": "aug_796", "anchor": "This essay will establish that the greatest achievement of the EU is peacekeeping and war prevention and that European integration across several areas is integral to ensuring peace. Economic, cultural and legal integration will be examined to evaluate their impact on the overall success of the European Union, drawing on citizens' opinion, empirical evidence of success and criticisms of each area. However, it will finally conclude that peace across the continent is facilitated by cultural integration. Whilst economic integration prevents declarations of war, it is the individual citizens, brought together through cultural integration that allows for a closer union. Whilst co-dependence and economic reliance upon other nations prevents the declaration of war due to shared economic and monetary policies, which was established by the creation of the European Coal and Steel community in 1951. Ultimately, cultural integration reduces opposition to further economic and legal integration across EU members as they grow closer to the idea of a \u2018European identity\u2019. This will further be proven by the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, of which a large proportion of the factors that contributed to the result are cultural. Drawing a comparison with other regional organisations and their failures highlights the success of the EU project, particularly with its peacekeeping efforts, and will ultimately conclude that cultural integration is more important to peace and security than economic integration in today\u2019s European society. Economic integration began with the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1951 to merge economic ties of 6 European countries to create the ECSC. The objective of this treaty was to prevent the outbreak of war by the nations becoming economically interdependent with one another (McCormick, 2015). The \u2018Schuman plan\u2019 did aim to spillover the concepts of the ECSC to all other aspects of the economy. This ECSC evolved to become the EEC, after the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, with the effects coming into force in January the following year. The objective was to allow free movement of goods, services, capital and people; the main motivation was to \u2018avoid any return to national protectionism\u2019 (Bulmer et al, 2017). Despite the creation of a single market resulting in uneven benefits and disadvantages for each member, all six countries believed their economies would be better off in such a community, even if there were disproportionalities. Stagflation in the 1970\u2019s limited the growth of the EEC, and by the mid-80\u2019s a new plan for the future of the union was set out by Delors in response to the global economic climate. The white papers set a deadline of 1992 for the measures outlined to be enacted in each member state. The measures heavily referred to as \u2018the 4 freedoms\u2019; capital, services, goods and labour, achieved by removing physical, fiscal and technical barriers to movement between inter-EU borders. With the history of economic integration outlined above, the advantages must be evaluated in order to answer the question. Benefits of a single market include the following; reduced production costs, lower prices for consumers, transfer of knowledge and skills, trade creation and co-operation on common projects by pooling skills, labour, knowledge and materials. These benefits ultimately mean that EU citizens have greater job opportunities, less expensive goods, and in some cases more advanced technology due the pooling of knowledge and materials. Further integration across the European union progressed with the creation of the Eurozone. The Economic and Monetary Union became an objective in 1969, coming to fruition in 1999, with the introduction of the Euro currency. The single currency creates benefits for its citizens in that it provides more economic stability, lower costs as currency would no longer need to be converted and a stronger presence in the global economy. The introduction of the currency undoubtedly brings the union closer together, however there are a number of disadvantages of adopting a single currency. The largest being that monetary policy that covers a large, diverse area consisting of a number of nations, does not always fit local economic conditions. Economic conditions consider unemployment rates and inflation rates, standard Keynesian economic policy involves the increase or decrease of interest rates in order to prevent economic crash or to stimulate the economy. Connected to this issue, we will reflect on the Eurozone crisis of 2009 and evaluate to what extent the implementation of the single currency is successful. Problems associated with a single currency are that it limits fiscal policy, and interest rates set are not optimal for every area. Both of these problems contributed in some way to the Eurozone crisis. According to Wijffelaars and Loman, the two causes of the eurozone crisis were the lack of effective mechanisms andor institutions to prevent the build-up of macro-economic institutions to effectively absorb shocks (Wijffelaars and Loman, 2015). However, in balance, the introduction of the euro promotes trade and encourages investment and has ultimately furthered economic integration across the European Union. In addition, according to Risse, the introduction of a physical currency shared with multiple nations across the union acts as a symbol of integration. The daily use of euro notes and coins reinforces the idea of a European identity (Risse, cited in Bulmer et al, 2017). To elaborate further on the concept of \u2018European identity\u2019, this section of the essay will now focus on the impact of cultural integration in maintaining peace across Europe. Firstly, one must discuss the relationship between national identities and European identities. According to Ultan, the 2 identities have a close relationship. Whilst national identity is the most important and strongest, it is possible to have multiple identities, such as European (Ultan, 2016). By adopting a \u2018European identity\u2019, citizens can move slightly further away from nationalism (an important goal of the entire European integration project), and will be more likely to align themselves with EU policies and not just their own national policies (Ultan, 2016). The integration process for each country differs depending on the states\u2019 traditions and cultures, but the same goal of assimilation to European culture is a fundamental objective to increase support for EU membership. The Treaty of Rome signed in 1957 had no mention of culture or any form of cultural integration (Ultan, 2016), it was only with the signing of the Maastricht treaty in 1992 that this area of integration was considered and first mentioned. The Maastricht treaty set out the concept of European Citizenship, which grants rights to citizens of each member state including consular protection and freedom to live, work, and travel freely in other member states. According to the Eurobarometer survey conducted by the European commission, which surveys the opinion of 33,000 European citizens across all member states, shows that 68% feel that \u2018they are a citizen of the EU\u2019 (Stone, 2017). With the majority of the population identifying as a European citizen, it is clear to suggest that this area of integration has been successful. The ability for citizens of EU member states to move across borders to work, travel and live freely not only gives one a feeling of citizenship but also that the different nations are together as one. According to the European Commission, the freedom of movement is regarded by the majority of EU citizens as the greatest achievement of European integration (European Commission, 2019). Ultan also identifies several important factors that are responsible for the success of cultural integration in Europe. The shared history, common religion and geography all have a direct impact on the integration process as they aid to create an identity that those across Europe can relate to. In his paper, Ultan also suggests that across Europe, citizens are \u2018bound by their diversity\u2019 (Ultan, 2016) and that in the creation of a European identity there should be respect for the fact there are a wide range of cultures, traditions and languages. This is reflected in article 6 of the Amsterdam Treaty, \u2018 The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States\u2019. As Ultan suggests, promoting individual member states' cultural diversity results in respect for other nation\u2019s culture (Ultan, 2016). Ultimately, this brings the union closer by means of respect and acceptance. To further argue the importance of an established European identity, the example of Brexit can be drawn upon to suggest that the member state must recognise being European is a wider extension of their national identity; and not two separate identities which are at war with one another. It must be noted that the UK has always had difficulty aligning themselves with the rest of Europe, beginning with the reluctance to join what was then the ECSC, but eventually joining in 1973. The idea that the UK views Europe as the \u2018other\u2019 naturally creates Euroscepticism, which has been prevalent in the UK for decades; and became popularised during the leave campaign in 2016 (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). According to the Eurobarometer survey, the (now previous) member state which views their national identity as exclusive was the UK, meaning that the majority of the UK\u2019s population were unable to identify as European and suggesting that the national identity and the European identity are in conflict. With the result of the 2016 EU referendum in mind, one can assume that the idea of a European identity is fundamental for maintaining support for the union. Murray Stewart Leith et al suggest that the reason for \u2018lukewarm feelings\u2019 of Britons towards the EU is due to the fact that there has not been a national circumstance where joining the EU seemed necessary to solve the issue; unlike in a number of other EU member states (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). For example. Germany\u2019s desire to join the EU was to create a more integrated Europe and to reconstruct it\u2019s national identity after the second world war, and Italy wanting a more stable political structure which the EU could offer (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). The lack of European identity directly correlates with the lack of support for EU membership, and whilst this can be considered a major factor in the outcome of the referendum, the EU is not concerned that this feeling is spreading across the continent. The Eurobarameter survey conducted after the result in 2017 shows the support of citizens for the EU is actually at an all time high. It could be perhaps suggested, that Brexit has made the EU and the feeling of being European stronger for the remaining member states. Further integration is necessary for maintaining a strong union and preserving peace, by increasing areas of integration and promoting the notion of a European identity, the EU can ensure its success in peacekeeping. The increase of integration across several areas can be explained by the neofunctionalist theory. This theory presents the argument that when one area is integrated, further pressure by actors can be exerted in other areas- causing a \u2018spillover effect\u2019. It\u2019s relevance in theorizing the EU has diminished since the 1980\u2019s, but does however explain the transition from the ECSC to the EEC. The debate surrounding integration theories for the EU are still ongoing, but many do stress the importance of supranational institutions in furthering European integration. An area of integration, whilst not the most important to preserving peace by maintaining stability, but certainly an area that provides means of which other areas of integration can occur, is legal integration. The European Court of Justice upholds European law introduced by other institutions of the union. The ECJ acts as a supranational institution, and has jurisdiction in all member states, ruling on interpretation of the treaties. According to Garrett, governments largely accept the rulings of the ECJ, and the ECJ as a strategic rational actor rules taking into account anticipated reactions of the governments (Garrett, 1995). Understanding why institutions like the ECJ are important to integration across the European union can be thought of \u2018integration through law\u2019, intertwining European law into national law bounds all its citizens by common rule. Whilst each member state can implement its own national laws, it must enforce the laws introduced by the EU. According to Augenstein, \u2018the legal system posits or presents the identity of the political community\u2019 (Augenstein, 2012), thus inferring that the enforcement of law across all member states builds a sense of community and reinforces the idea of a European identity. The aforementioned successes of areas of integration speak for themselves in that they are great achievements not only for each member nation\u2019s economies, but for every single European citizen at an individual level. The unique success of the EU project shines its achievements across all areas of integration. However, in order to address the question, this essay will now focus on why peacekeeping is the single greatest achievement. By comparing the EU and its peacekeeping efforts with that of regional organizations in the Middle East, the achievements of integration and peacekeeping in Europe can be highlighted and clearly identified. The Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, created in 1945 and 1981 respectively, are two regional organisations in the Middle East established with similar aims as those of Schuman when the ECSC was created in Europe. The aim was to begin economic integration amongst the member states, and to mediate any regional conflicts without foreign assistance. Largely, both these organisations have been unsuccessful. According to Pinfari, the Gulf cooperation council \u2018systematically failed to mediate effectively in major conflicts in the Gulf\u2019 (Pinfari, 2009). Pinfari concluded his analysis of the success and failures of the Arab league and GCC by saying that claiming the entire project as a failure is \u2018ungenerous\u2019, yet the organisations do not have effective control on conflict resolution (Pinfari, 2009). It can also be argued that the Arab states have an inability to sacrifice their state sovereignty to a regional pool, whereas this has been done in Europe and ultimately allows the union to be successful. It could perhaps be argued that instability in the region can be largely blamed by the volatile and complicated history of the Middle East, however the continent of Europe has also had its fair share of historical violent conflicts. The success of the institutions created to maintain a strong bond between member states is especially highlighted when contrasted with the Arab league. The strongest evidence of success being that the EU was honoured by the Nobel committee in 2012 for \u2018over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe\u2019 (The Nobel Peace Prize 2012, 2020). To conclude, the single greatest achievement of the European Union is peacekeeping between member states, but this has only been preserved due to strong economic and cultural integration. Both areas of integration are fundamental to peacekeeping; economic integration forms ties between states at the governmental level, but cultural integration forms the ties (and builds support for the union) at an individual level. Support for the evergrowing union must come from the individual citizens of each state, not just the governments. This was proven with Brexit, where the lack of European identity amongst its citizens resulted in a vote to leave the union, despite the government\u2019s support for membership. This is why the EU project has been so successful, because each citizen benefits from the EU, not only economically, but also in that they have the right to travel, work and live across the continent. By providing citizens with several benefits, the support for the union increases. One would argue that cultural integration is more important to ensuring peace as not only does it prevent opposition for further economic integration but it also creates the idea of a single European identity. So to answer the question, economic integration is not the EU\u2019s greatest achievement; but that is not to say it is not important or extremely beneficial to member state governments and European citizens. Whilst economic integration was the primary goal when the ECSC was created, today the union requires deeper integration in order to survive and preserve peace. The conclusion that the single greatest accomplishment of the EU project is peacekeeping derives from the simple fact that since the establishment of the ECSC, which has evolved to become the EU we know today, there has not been a continental outbreak of war, and peace between EU member states has been maintained. The aims set out by the Schuman plan have been fulfilled as Europe has not been involved in any intercontinental war, breaking a cycle of continuous conflict since the 16th century (Ette, 2016).", "positive": ", Thank you for all your help last year when I took a break from my studies.

{"id": "aug_819", "anchor": "Immigration refers to \u2018the process by which people come in to a foreign country to live\u2019 (Cambridge Dictionary 2019). There are a range of political, social, and economic motivations behind migrating. The costs and benefits of immigration vary dependent upon the point of view from which they are being examined. According to the Office for National Statistics \u2018migration is still adding to the population of the UK\u2019 (Office for National Statistics 2018). In June 2018 \u2018273,000 more people moved to the UK with the plan to stay for 12+ months\u2019 (Office for National Statistics 2018) than left. The Specific Factor Model can help us to understand further the impacts of immigration. The \u2018variant of the Ricardian model\u2019 (Iowa State University 2019) and was developed \u2018to explain the migration of workers from the rural to urban areas after the Industrial Revolution in the 1820s\u2019 (Iowa State University 2019). The model \u2018allows for the existence of factors of production besides labour\u2019 (Krugman, Obstfeld &amp; Melitz 2018). It recognises labour as \u2018a mobile factor that can move between sectors\u2019 but also that \u2018other factors are assumed to specific\u2019 and may only \u2018be used in the production of particular goods\u2019 (Krugman, Obstfeld &amp; Melitz 2018). The diagram below displays the effects of International Labour Mobility. The line MPL represents the marginal product of labour for the home country and MPL* the foreign country. Profit maximisation occurs when the value created by an additional unit of labour equals the cost of employing that unit. Microeconomic theory allows us to assume that MPL is equal to real wages. This assumes that a monetary value can be placed upon productivity. Initially, the number of workers employed in the home country (H) is represented by 0 to L1 and the number employed in the foreign country (F) is represented by 0* to L1. It is assumed that H is labour abundant relative to F and therefore incentives to migrate to find work exist. Wages levels in H start at W and in F at W*. Workers migrate from H to F and in the process of doing so alter wage rates and employment levels in each country, allowing an integrated equilibrium at point A to be achieved. The new equilibrium sees H employing 0 to L2 which is lower than the initial number. F now employs 0* to L2; higher than the original amount. Wages increase in H from W to W\u2019 and fall in F from W* to W\u2019. They have converged to the equal level of W\u2019. Dependent upon the perspective from which this impact is being examined, this can be considered a cost or benefit of immigration. The home country sees the benefit of increased wage rates whereas the foreign country sees wages rates fall. This may have a negative impact upon the foreign country\u2019s current workforce by lowering the incentive to participate in the labour force. A fall in wage rates may also cause adverse selection as workers with \u2018certain unobservable characteristics are more likely to enter the market at the current market price\u2019 (Sloman, Garratt &amp; Guest 2018). This means that workers with lower skill sets and productivity are the most incentivised to enter the workforce. Higher skilled workers may choose to not work as they feel the current market price undervalues their abilities. However, a study shows that an average inflow of immigrants equating to 1% of the UK-born population leads to just a 0.6% decline in wages for the lowest 5% of paid workers (Dustmann, Frattini and Preston 2008). This suggests that the negative impact upon wages resulting from immigration is minor and the other benefits may easily be seen to outweigh this. Finally, the area ABC represents the overall world output increase following migration. This shows that migration of workers benefits the global economy and allows a higher output level to be achieved. One of the benefits to the UK of immigration is the provision of an increased labour force. In the year ending June 2018 \u2018migration for work remained the most common reason\u2019 (Office for National Statistics 2018) for moving to the UK. This is beneficial to the UK as it may help to fill skills gaps and resolve the continued productivity puzzle. The productivity puzzle refers to the \u2018relatively weak\u2019 UK \u2018productivity growth since the late-2000\u2019s recession\u2019 (Office for Budget Responsibility 2012). The increased labour force raises competition for jobs incentivising workers to be more productive in order to secure work. It also allows companies to be more selective over who they employ enabling them to raise output. Furthermore, an increased labour force can raise aggregate demand, gross domestic product (GDP) and tax revenues. With more people in work the levels of disposable income in the economy is likely to increase and therefore have a positive impact upon the demand for goods and services causing an increase in consumption (Pettinger 2017). Higher employment also generates more tax revenues for the UK government due to more workers paying income tax. This can lead to increased government spending. A combination of increased levels of both consumption and government spending in the economy is likely to raise aggregate demand. Consequently, the aggregate demand curve shifts rightwards as displayed in the diagram below. The initial aggregate demand (AD) is represented by the curve AD1. The curve shifts to AD2 and causes the level of real GDP to rise from Y1 to Y2. This increase in GDP as a result of higher demand has a positive impact on the economy. It is working towards the macroeconomic objective of \u2018achieving economic growth\u2019 and also implies improved \u2018levels of economic welfare\u2019 (Powell and Powell 2015). It shows an example of demand pull inflation; \u2018a rising price level caused by an increase in aggregate demand\u2019 (Powell and Powell 2016). The price level has risen from P1 to P2 causing inflation. Finally, immigration of working age people is beneficial towards improving the UK\u2019s dependency ratio (Pettinger 2017). In 2016 the age dependency ratio was reported at around 56.17% of the working age population (Trading Economics 2016). The UK currently has an aging population and therefore \u2018the old age dependency ratio (OADR) is increasing\u2019 (Office for National Statistics 2017). This means that more tax revenues are required to continue paying out pensions and cover the care costs of more elderly people. The UK population alone is likely to struggle in maintaining these payments and therefore workers from abroad are beneficial as they provide more revenue for the government. On the other hand, there is the risk that immigrants may take up work in black markets to receive cash in hand payments and avoid paying taxes. Not only does this impact negatively upon government revenue but it also highlights the potential risk of increased crime rates due to immigration. However, there are also potential costs to the UK of immigration. It \u2018brings social and cultural pressures that need to be taken into account in planning for future services\u2019(Embrace 2019) and may cause potential strains on the economy. Firstly, immigration poses potential complications with language barriers and cultural differences. There is the risk that immigrants may not have the language skills to meet job requirements and therefore may struggle to find or remain in work. This may require the provision of more education as immigrants seek courses to help improve language abilities. Courses are often funded by the government therefore increasing government expenditure. Furthermore, there may be strong differences in culture and this can result in \u2018difficulties and friction with local people\u2019 (Embrace 2019). Some locals may take the view that their culture is being destroyed by an influx of other cultures and this can impact negatively upon the integration of communities. Finally, the net increase to UK population resulting from immigration \u2018can put pressure on public services\u2019 (Embrace 2019) such as the NHS, education and housing system. For example \u2018immigration contributes to financial pressure on the NHS\u2019 (Dayan 2016). With the NHS already running a large deficit of \u00a3960 million at the end of the 201718 period (The Kings Fund 2018), any additional strain from immigration can only worsen the situation. There is also wide spread shortage of housing across the UK. Figures predict that around 300,000 more houses need to be built annually to try and combat the housing crisis (Mortgage Finance Gazette 2019). Again, with immigration adding to the population each year an extra strain is being placed on the housing system (Pettinger 2017). Furthermore, immigration can also impact negatively upon the UK welfare benefits system. Some immigrants may meet the criteria to receive certain welfare payments and this therefore increases government expenditure. At the end of the 2018 financial year, the UK\u2019s budget deficit was reported at \u00a31,763.8 billion; \u2018equivalent to 85.8% of gross domestic product (GDP)\u2019 (Office for National Statistics 2018). Additional payments to immigrants in the form of funding for education, housing, health care and welfare benefit payments may therefore add to this deficit causing further debt for the UK government. All extra expenditure focusing upon funding additional services for immigrants comes with an opportunity cost. The money could instead be used to fund a range of programmes aiming to improve long term supply factors such as productivity and human capital. It could be invested in UK businesses or used to fund tuition fees for UK students. In conclusion, industrialisation and globalisation have aided immigration and its potential benefits to the world\u2019s economy. It has enabled productivity and welfare improvements worldwide. For any economy, including the UK, there are a range of both costs and benefits of immigration. Whilst the UK\u2019s immigration \u2018figures have remained broadly stable since the end of 2016\u2019(Office for National Statistics 2018) events such as BREXIT and increased protectionism by other nations may affect these in the future. The UK in general benefits from immigration by receiving a larger workforce and therefore greater tax revenues. The main costs to the UK results from the increased populations effect upon public services. As the UK is a developed economy, it receives a greater benefit from immigration of workers who can fill skills gaps and aid productivity.", "positive": "that's the one.

Kind regards, Hi , Unfortunately i will not be able to attend as i am working on placement and cant take time off to attend rep meetings. I am a rep for placement year . Feedback i have received from students: -Students have been struggling with the communication with placement team in emails, students have to chase up a lot and the team does not report back any changes in any processing. -There is also a confusion regarding the required 150 days of work, does it account for annual leave given by employers and how is it tracked, will it be signed off on by employers? -Some placement tutors have been hard to get in touch with and sort out a date with for the visit required. Others such as my own (Dr ) have been really good and visits have been very well communicated. -Students feel like they would want drop in\u2019s for support on reflective writing later on in the year before the assignment deadline. -Student identified lack of communication on when assignment drafts will be marked and fed-back.

If possible could you guys check out the email I forwarded of \u2019s response to our ideas on multiculturalism, beforehand, because once we\u2019ve finalised a questiontopic title, we can discuss a structure and hopefully get started on writing our parts.

Well he said we do get the 5 day leeway, which is probably good for us considering we haven\u2019t started.

Obviously I\u2019ll tell the others too look at this response too, because it\u2019s our starting point. If you don\u2019t have it, I can forward it again. Let me know. Also I apologise for the lack of communication and not even starting it yet, it\u2019s kind of a shit time for me right now so it\u2019s just stupidly been pushed to the back of my mind, but ultimately this is a group project and it\u2019s completely not fair on everyone else. Hey, yes that sounds good to me. Hello , Unfortunately due to health issues and how devastated my well-being was in general last term, I felt I was completely unable to produce a decent piece of work for this module. I got into contact with my personal tutor and he made me aware of the automatic deferral, the university has put in place this academic year, to allow students to defer assessments till the summer. I was told to not submit and no penalty would be given, I just will be doing it in the summer instead. I wanted to know if you had any specific information about how the assessment for this module will run for the summer deferral? For example, Will the question be different? Will it still be a the same type of assessment (case study)? Also, do you know the exact date of the deferral, or when I would be able to find out? Lastly, I really did enjoy this module and your delivery of it, you seem like a great linguistic and cool guy, it\u2019s just a shame that things were not the best for me, and that circumstances meant we could not meet on campus.

{"id": "aug_843", "anchor": "Wasons selection task was influenced by how hypothesis testing should use the hypo deductive method. He invented 3 problems, including the Selection task. The selection task is a principal tool people use to find out whether their general statements are true. The abstract version includes 4 cards (a latter on one side and a number in the other) followed by conditional rules. However, despite the simplicity, people still tend to find the task difficult. Therefore, success in this task depends on the insight model (Jhonson-Laird &amp; Wason, 1972). The insight model involves 3 levels; During the first level people only focus on cards that confirm the rule. In level 2, people realise that both instances, conforming and falsifying the rule are important and lastly, people realise that the only cards that falsify the rule are important. However, according to the memory cueing hypotheses, concrete version of this task has been found to be easier than the abstract version, this is due to the content being familiar and dealt with in the past (Griggs &amp; Cox, 1982). Examples of the concrete version include the so-called drinking law problem; Griggs &amp; Cox, 1982. In this problem, the cards were labelled \u2018beer\u2019, \u2018coke\u2019, \u201922 years\u2019 etc. At which, participants were good in selecting the right cards. Further reasonings to explain the facility of this version of the task are the pragmatic reasoning schemas. The idea that people use context-dependent rules of interference. The most important of which, is the permission schema where people tend to perform better when a permission rule is involved. For example, \u2018if one acts A, then they must first satisfy a condition prior to it in which people did much better than on the traditional selection task. Similarity, the social contract theory states people tend to perform better when there are implied rules. However, critics about rules of permission and obligation (deontic reasoning).

I have had to contact security myself 6 times within the last 2 weeks and my flatmate has also contacted security a number of times. I cannot understand why this flatmate has not been dealt with. I have not slept in 3 weeks due to his constant loud noise. This is seriously disturbing my life at Uni and more importantly disturbing my studies and that of my other flatmates aswell. I spoke to a member of staff at the Reception at on , who was extremely unhelpful and the noise still continues from about 9pm to 8am everyday. I was told that the problem of noise complaints was only dealt with by security but since they are not getting through to this flatmate, it should be escalated to yourselves as this is becoming highly unprofessional and is not the student care I expect for the money I am paying for my accommodation and student services.

Students would prefer to have smaller seminar groups with a seminar leader present so discussion can be encouraged by the leader and students then get more out of the activity sessions particularly in Quizzes - students felt like the small quizzes within the lectures were benefiting their learning by testing their learning as they go and would prefer if other modules adapted to this and imputed small quizzes within the lectures to test and consolidate students learning workshop sessions - some students were wanting the correct answers for the workshop sessions to be posted after the workshops, whether that be immediately after or a week after as students felt like they couldn't clarify whether they were getting the right answers and if they were entering the data into correctly as last year in the in-person sessions students could get their answers checked by the lecturer present Module Guides - Some students were feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information for the modules across different areas of and were requesting that modules take on a similar approach to modules by putting all the required reading for each week, the lectures to be completed that week and the assessment dates all into one document as a module guide so students can have that as a basic outline of their modules and the work to be completed to reduce the feelings of being overwhelmed Careers and placements - students felt positively about the support being provided by the placements team this year in such an unpredictable work climate - students felt positively about the change to software as it is easier to navigate and use Thats all the feedback I have collected off the second year students and hope to discuss this with you all in the meeting later Thanks Second Year Student", "positive": "ould hear them from the lift Like I woke up before they got in the flat door Gonna try and sleep again night love you xx Oi where are you x Aww miss u :(((( Put my alarm on to say bye but didn\u2019t realise you were going early :(( Also you\u2019ve left your door open xx Bless him and lolll not even had your morning poo yes you need to need to tell me what\u2019s gone down with xxx How you feeling about it all xxx Sorry literally just barely been on snap and thanks b just trying to not overthink xx Love u xx", "positive_attacked": "ould hear them from the lift Like I woke up before they got in the flat door Gonna try and sleep again night love you xx Oi where are you x Aww miss u :(((( Put my alarm on to say bye but didn\u2019t realise you were going early :(( Also you\u2019ve left your door open xx Bless him and lolll not even had your morning poo yes you need to need to tell me what\u2019s gone down with xxx How you feeling about it all xxx Sorry literally just barely been on snap and thanks b just trying to not overthink xx Love u xx", "label": 1}

The segmentation will investigate students on and off campus interested in vehicle usage whilst at university (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020). A target market is the group of individuals a business aims to sell its products and services to, where marketing messages can be crafted effectively once the market is established (Omicsonline.org, 2020). The target market is aimed towards the student demographic at Aston University on and off campus coming from different towns and backgrounds. It is innovative to allow students to drive flexibly instead of incurring the cost of a vehicle overall for commuting. The segment could become profitable through promotional activities and distribution channels after identifying the segment\u2019s needs. (Marketing-Insider, 2020). Differentiation of Enterprise Car club is offering a self-service car rental plan, tailored to students at cost-effective prices with virtual membership and option to rent by the hour or day, alongside a monthly membership option currently priced at \u00a35.95 per hour and monthly prices at \u00a36 per month subscription. This is more accessible to a younger demographic of students who typically use mobile technology frequently. Aston University students could see this as an opportunity to benefit by not spending significant amounts, especially with current rising costs of living. Positioning refers to a business\u2019s ability to influence perceptions of consumers concerning a brand or product. The main objective is to establish an identity of an offering, so customers perceive it positively (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020). Enterprise is a company that is going to be offering a cheap and available service to students alongside reducing carbon footprints(reference). This could attract segments of the demographic, who favour being conscious of the environment for the future. (reference) Enterprise Rent A Cars\u2019 already significant profile to allow consumers to feel safe with the company\u2019s new service, proving the reliable position they already pose compared to competitors such as CO-wheels CarClub and SIXT. Students can be targeted through social media platforms and through campaigning on university campus similarly to UberEATS, by employing campaigners to increase awareness. A perceptual map is a tool used to differentiate competitors and highlight any gaps in the market. It shows our business as a high quality and low-price service, highlighting the potential for the brand to succeed and gain awareness amongst students. One of our main competitors is SIXT, discovered by constructing this perceptual map, we have established our advantage as we offer suitable age restrictions on the use of rentals as students will want to travel inside and outside of Birmingham more frequently. Campaign objectives Specific is a clear, precise and directional objective put forward to understand what results are expected within the workforce, instead of the objective being generalised, causing confusion and poorer results (Lalama, 2015). An effective goal would be to increase sales by a certain percentage or increase the target on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis. Our specific objectives are 1)To attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. 2)To improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service Measurable measures a goal and is the stage where numbers come into fruition to keep track of progress. However, it can be difficult to understand if an objective has been reached. Our measuring will be through: 1)Using surveys to measure student\u2019s demand based on needs and wants, 2)Identifying any potential niches. This would allow the measurable objective of attaining 40-50 subscription members each month and link to the founding values of the company to honour consumers by listening to them. Achievable goals are setting goals in a realistic period by taking small, planned steps towards a goal. 1)An example of a goal to be set is attaining data within each quarter of the year alongside aiming to increase brand awareness by 10%. Additionally, once achieved, the goal can progress to 20 new subscription members to achieve progression. Overall this will contribute to the objective of reaching out to Aston University staff and students, with reasonable pricing that is visibly differentiated to competitors. Realistic is forming goals based on the context of current economic, organisational and market conditions (Anon, 2020). 1)The current economic state will determine the likelihood of success when aiming to increase sales, as this would not be the best goal to set if the country is close to experiencing a recession period in their economic cycle. 2)Being the best low-cost provider is an example of a realistic goal for Enterprise CarClub profile competition, considering economic uncertainty in the UK because of Brexit. People may be less inclined to invest in vehicle ownership or maintenance because of the potential future inflation rate and currency value volatility. 3)Targeting 500 students as dealing with a small target market in the geographic location of Birmingham, this is a link to what we want to achieve and realistic. Targeted &amp; Timed is using a specified deadline to reach a goal. If a time expiration does not exist, it will hinder efforts towards an achievement and evaluation. 1)Trying to achieve the specified number by the end of the year at Aston University, the target will be achieved through pushing collaborations through social media, helping target and appeal to the target market. 2)Customers will be more engaged with the services being offered, whilst measuring the effectiveness of this approach during and after and if results are proving unsatisfactory, measures can be taken to improve consumer satisfaction (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). Strategy and general rationale for specific tools In the marketing strategy, there has been research on five stages, concerning our strategy. In initial thought, developing a strategic mission, vision and values allow Enterprise CarClub to set its standard to consumers and provide a positive image for their services. Setting objectives as stated in campaign objectives would be important to reach the vision, but meeting targets will only be possible if a strategy is tailored to the intended path. Executing the strategy would be the next step aided by prerequisites put in place, for example; a Gantt chart to work with, values to work towards goals and a mission to work on present communications to gain significant awareness. After executing the strategy, the focus is on analysing the external environment continuously, alongside the company\u2019s internal situation to identify corrective adjustments (Gamble, Thompson and Peteraf, 2019). General rationale for specific tools selected: In the marketing plan, looking further into advertising as a negotiated form of traditional and digital communication from an identifiable source can influence audiences. In the marketing plan, we are looking to follow a push strategy through Enterprise\u2019s profile to attract the target market to buy subscriptions. It will allow Enterprise CarClub to reach the goal of building awareness with students, encourage and incentivise them to build a differentiated strategy in competition with others. A community of consumers can be built alongside the strategy by considering and monitoring brand image. (Richards and Curran, 2002). Secondly, Sales Promotion is going to be used as it influences consumers in a way to buy a product (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is a tool that will influence student behaviour positively as incentives will be offered to trial the service initially and then decide to proceed if satisfied. A pull strategy will reel in consumers through discounts, bonuses, and coupons creating a feeling of need for the service. Marketing Tool Plans- Advertising Tool Advertising is a strong form of communication that will enable Enterprise CarClub to reach their audience through engaging using a variety of resources, using the media category to carry advertising messages to allow for the use of billboards, magazines, digital newspapers and mobile and online advertising (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). Digital media has a strong level of interactivity in modern lives with social media being very prominent, for example, Instagram. Using this tool will provide Enterprise with a giant opportunity for advertisement (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is prefered to use this tool because of the benefits it will bring in terms of reaching a wider audience, especially with electronic word of mouth having a large impact and high level of users. Advertising holds the credibility to support marketing efforts such as; sales promotion, using methods to secure customers into the car rental subscriptions as consumers spend on what they believe will bring them reputable value. Advertising holds the capability of effecting knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviour of a target audience, persuading individuals to buy a product they have never purchased. It can suggest that advertising can increase sales using manipulative and psychological techniques with a large segment of passive consumers concerning the \u2018Strong\u2019 theory of advertising (Fill, 2009). The (AIDA) model presents creating brand awareness of a product or service, the interest of the benefits of its uses to build sufficient foundation to encourage the buyer to research further, desire to go forward with an emotional connection through brand personality making consumers want it and action to make the buyer take the next step of engaging in making a phone call, signing up to a newsletter or engaging in a live chat for further information. With awareness, a PR campaign can be running towards the student target market each month with different resources. Interest wise we could use surveys to gain student interest on campus to then offer further consultation after gaining the initial interest of what is important to their tailored service. Desire could lead to running local buzz campaigns to generate discounts due to the curiosity of a new service. An action could be to use local advertising alongside social media to receive discounts during face to face or phone advertising to show empathy to needs for the short term or long term (How much do celebrities and influencers get paid for social posts? - Our Social Times - Social Media for Business, 2020). Sales Promotion Tool Sales promotion offers an incentive to encourage target audiences with promotional messages to buy the product sooner than later (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It creates a differentiated strategy, launching the new Enterprise CarClub at Aston University by offering value to customers through planning sales promotion to incentivise students. Upselling opportunities are created with a variety of packages, starting from \u00a34.50, enhanced at \u00a33.45hour and under 22s at \u00a35.95hour plans. Sales Promotion presents the entrance to a partnership endorsement by sponsoring our car rental service. A well-known Birmingham hip hop artist \u2018Mist\u2019 will be integrated, who possesses a following of 670,000 (Instagram.com, 2020). By working in collaboration, this will build brand credibility and make the brand stand out to the demographic at Aston. Consumers will recall and remember the promotion, bringing in targeted behavioural marketing. Therefore, the student\u2019s interest is captured, making them feel more inclined to sign up for the subscription (The Pros and Cons of Celebrity Endorsements - Baer Performance Marketing, 2020).. This partnership will offer a promotional online code discount and print coupons associated with himself to pull in more consumers to use the service, working towards the goal of reaching 500 buyers by year-end. He is already proactive in supporting Birmingham to make the city a better place through his involvement in projects, he will be more inclined to partner at a lower price than expected by an influencer of his popularity. (Mist Interview: U.K. Star Talks Hometown of Birmingham &amp; U.S. Rap Influences| Billboard, 2020). Endorser attributes tie in with the TEARS model of trustworthiness, relating to endorsement being someone who can be trusted, have respect and expertise in the brand, physical attractiveness with pride in his health. Coming from a disadvantaged background in Birmingham, then progressing resonates with the target audience as students use him as inspiration towards goals. To have someone who is not just someone with a conative but affective strategy too, makes consumers feel to act on the Enterprise CarClub through a use of display of emotion and care (The Five Components in the TEARS Model of Endorser Attributes T Trustworthiness | Course Hero, 2020). Managerial accountability allows the results of sales promotion to be easily justified in comparison to advertising. This way the margin for error as a calculated number will help in realising if the chosen promotion is effective towards our target market (Fill and Turnbull, 2016; Difference between advertising and sales promotion, 2020). Implementation plan demonstrating the relative scheduling of Marcom tool activity: Creating the Gantt chart has enabled the 12 months of promotion for Enterprise Car Club to be planned out month by month. It establishes clear objectives and timeframes for which each tool should be executed. Using the advertising tool helps build brand value and image by encouraging change in consumer behaviour. For the advertising tool, TV advertisements, billboards, and promotional products will use the pulsing marketing strategy. These are scheduled as a continuous schedule lasting the whole year at a low level throughout, becoming heavier during the peak times for selling (Continuous Advertising Definition | Marketing Dictionary | MBA Skool-Study.Learn. Share., 2020). The peak times here are September, to take advantage of the advertising opportunities during freshers when students are most interested. Also, from December to February, the advertising tool is being used alongside our sponsor Mist performing, allocated sufficiently before the event and after to keep the awareness going. Viral marketing is a flighting strategy due to the one-month period it is allocated solely to throughout the year. Within the advertising tool, internetsocial media adverts will be the continuous marketing strategy, as they will be available and shown to customers throughout the whole year, unlike the other tasks within the tool (Flighting, 2020). The sales promotion tool will make use of discountscoupons and loyalty schemes as a continuous marketing strategy. These methods will always be available to consumers, so they are reminded of the need for the services, regardless of sales performance at any given time of the year. The fresher\u2019s fair, contests, exhibitions, and fairs will all be making use of the flighting strategy as the advertising will be run at certain planned times, then have a cessation period throughout the year (9 Benefits of Sales Promotions - Gary A. Sanchez, 2020). Integration of marcoms Our specific objective is to improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service and to attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. Advertising and sales promotion have been decided as the two main tools because of brand awareness it will provide the up and coming brand. Advertising is informing and reminding about the products and services and a form of mass communication and links to sales promotion goals to increase sales quickly using discounts for example. Considering the timeframe and the main aim to build awareness in the Aston student\u2019s target market, these tools provide a gateway to pull in consumers through trailing the service and use of endorsements to capture loyal customers.", "positive": ", I hope all is well.

Hi , I just wanted to confirm whether or not subheadings are included in the word count for the TP1 assignment \u2013 . Thanks, Hi Team, Thank you for this informative email. I noticed we don\u2019t have to take further action in regards to automatic deferral for assessments, but when will we receive more information about them? For instance, will we get an email confirming that we have been deferred for the summer assessment? I just want to be aware of roughly when this information will be passed to us, as I\u2019m conscious around exams, inboxes can get a bit crazy and I don\u2019t want to miss any important emails about the deferred assessments. Thanks, . Hi , I\u2019m a final year student and have a question about the lectures. This week I struggled to download the corresponding lecture slides to the recording. The usual format let\u2019s me download the material as a PowerPoint. However, for some reason this wasn\u2019t an option for this week and I could only access it as a web browser (HTML) which just opened the slides up as a new tab, or as an ebook. I was just wondering if this is just a system error, and whether we\u2019ll be able to download the PowerPoint presentation as normal next week.

{"id": "aug_873", "anchor": "Johns Case: John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010). Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: John\u2019s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John\u2019s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992). Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so. John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017). As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008), who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008). John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood. Coping: John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance. In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). Interventions: The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and has little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007). Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": "\ufffd\ud83d\ude2d Fml i got uni stress already I cant think hungry either Bro idk i dont leave my house \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I been in the outside 3 times since new years Saw a post saying boris might reverse lockdown lift Cz South African corona variant Idk if its tru tho Was on ig I can enjoy next couple years Suit shopping?\ud83d\ude2d Nd same suit both days im confusion Why ther two days But dont wanna ask Can pls ask why thers two days Itll sound normal \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Blessings upon u Days aint even together They like 4 days apart Everyone taking day off work for this?", "positive_attacked": "\ufffd\ud83d\ude2d Fml i got uni stress already I cant think hungry either Bro idk i dont leave my house \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I been in the outside 3 times since new years Saw a post saying boris might reverse lockdown lift Cz South African corona variant Idk if its tru tho Was on ig I can enjoy next couple years Suit shopping?\ud83d\ude2d Nd same suit both days im confusion Why ther two days But dont wanna ask Can pls ask why thers two days Itll sound normal \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Blessings upon u Days aint even together They like 4 days apart Everyone taking day off work for this?", "label": 1}
{"id": "aug_874", "anchor": "Rational choice theory \u2018deals with the way in which scarcity impinges upon the individual consumer and hence deals with the way in which such an individual makes choices\u2019 (Estrin et al., 2012). The model is \u2018predicated on the notion that individual actors purse goals efficiently\u2019 (Outhwaite et al., 2007). The term Homo Economicus is used to describe consumers and their sole aim of \u2018utility maximisation\u2019 (Fine., 2016). In-kind and unconditional cash transfers can be used by governments to aim to raise utility and welfare of specific groups in an economy. The effectiveness of these methods may depend upon many factors such as the target group of consumers, the area of consumption they aim to impact and the monetary value of the intervention. An in-kind transfer is a \u2018transfer payment\u2019 that is \u2018made in a specific good or service rather than cash\u2019 (Cengage.com., 2013). There are 3 main types of in-kind transfers; the provision of vouchers such as food stamps, the use of subsidies and providing free access to a good or service, for example, the NHS in the UK. In-kind transfers allocate the benefit provided to specific goods or services, for example, the UK Healthy start scheme provides a targeted group with \u2018vouchers that can only be spent on specific healthy foods\u2019 (Griffith et al., 2018). It was found the impact these vouchers had upon raising utility depended on how highly the consumer values healthy foods. Diagram 1 shows the impact a healthy food voucher has upon infra-marginal consumers. Infra-marginal consumers already spend more than the vouchers worth on healthy foods as they value these goods highly and therefore a steep indifference curve is used. They are willing to sacrifice a high proportion of other goods to gain a small extra amount of healthy foods. In the diagram, the food voucher is represented by the line A-C. The voucher has caused an increase in utility for the consumer as represented by the rightward shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2. The original point of maximum utility is represented by point X and the new higher maximum utility point is represented by point Y. The provision of food vouchers to infra-marginal consumers has positively impacted utility. Whilst utility has increased, the impact the voucher has had upon these consumers is very \u2018similar to an income-equivalent cash benefit\u2019 (Griffith et al., 2018). This means that providing an unconditional cash transfer to these consumers instead of the vouchers would have a similar effect on utility. They are still likely to spend the additional cash on healthy foods. On the other hand, distorted consumers do not value healthy foods as highly and therefore the voucher has a different effect upon their utility. Diagram 2 displays the effect of the food voucher upon distorted consumers. The lower utility received from consuming healthy foods is represented by a flatter indifference curve and this displays the lower marginal rate of substitution. This means that in comparison to diagram 1 the initial maximum utility point X occurs at a much lower quantity of healthy foods. The voucher causes a shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2 and therefore increases the utility from point X to point C. This shows that the vouchers are effective in raising utility for this group of consumers. However, the line C-E represents the cash alternative of the voucher. Here we can see that if these consumers were provided with cash instead of vouchers the higher maximum utility point of Y can be reached. This shows that these consumers are unlikely to purchase healthy foods if provided with a cash alternative to the vouchers. They would instead choose to purchase a variety of other goods and services. For distorted consumers, the food vouchers are less effective in raising utility and the consumers would prefer to receive a cash payment. Unconditional cash transfer programmes \u2018aim to improve well-being by providing cash to targeted poor households without placing any conditions on the household\u2019s actions\u2019 (Institute for Financial Studies., 2018). Consumers are therefore not restricted on how they spend this money. Providing consumers with additional cash to spend effectively increases their income. The rational choice model assumes that consumers will act rationally and use any additional income to maximise utility. However, behavioural economics challenges this and suggests that the use of labels for these cash payments can influence how the consumer spends this additional money. Behavioural economics \u2018adds elements of psychology to traditional models in an attempt to gain a better understanding of decision making\u2019 (Sloman et al., 2018). For example, the UK Winter Fuel payment is a \u2018cash transfer to older households\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014). \u2018Robust evidence of a behavioural effect of labelling\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014) was found in relation to this unconditional cash transfer. The study found that \u2018on average households spend 47% of the WFP on fuel\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014). This is in comparison to an expected 3% being spent on fuel if the payment was simply treated as cash. Behavioural economic tools such as nudges can be used to alter how consumers spend their income. This is a clear example of nudge theory and shows that \u2018positive reinforcement\u2019 \u2018can persuade people to make a particular choice\u2019 (Sloman et al., 2018). \u2018When a label is attached to a part of their budget, subjects change consumption according to the label\u2019 (Abler et al., 2017). This evidence shows that consumers are responsive to behavioural economic policies and therefore do not always act like Homo Economicus as suggested by the rational choice model. Overall, rational choice theory suggests that unconditional cash transfers are more effective at raising consumers\u2019 utility. It allows consumers to purchase the goods and services they decide will maximise their own utility. However, in the long run, depending upon the area of consumption being targeted in-kind transfers may be more beneficial for raising overall welfare. For example, the healthy food vouchers provide families with food of a higher quality and that is more beneficial to their health. If they were instead provided with cash, as the distorted consumer example shows, there is a chance that this money would not be spend on healthy foods and instead it may be used to purchase fast food alternatives. This is then likely to have a long-term impact on health and could contribute to strains on the healthcare system in the future. If unconditional cash transfers are to be used, behavioural economic approaches can be adopted to influence how consumers spend this money to enable the intervention to have the most desired impact.", "positive": "as v confused \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 let me know what your I\u2019m says about ! \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 No problem!!

{"id": "aug_889", "anchor": "Rationale: The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today\u2019s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual\u2019s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual\u2019s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. Results: Discourse 1- negativity of social media Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. Discourse 2- vital for families Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person. Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. Discourse 3- loneliness Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely. Discourse 4- social media not healthy Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved. Discussion: Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely. Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling. The wrong way to do it is by lying or exaggerating on social media just to acquire a specific response or reaction from the people reading it.", "positive": ", for some reason I checked my emails on morning and did not see the email for the tutorial catch up however checking my emails today it has now come through and I have missed the meeting.

{"id": "aug_890", "anchor": "Rational choice theory \u2018deals with the way in which scarcity impinges upon the individual consumer and hence deals with the way in which such an individual makes choices\u2019 (Estrin et al., 2012). The model is \u2018predicated on the notion that individual actors purse goals efficiently\u2019 (Outhwaite et al., 2007). The term Homo Economicus is used to describe consumers and their sole aim of \u2018utility maximisation\u2019 (Fine., 2016). In-kind and unconditional cash transfers can be used by governments to aim to raise utility and welfare of specific groups in an economy. The effectiveness of these methods may depend upon many factors such as the target group of consumers, the area of consumption they aim to impact and the monetary value of the intervention. An in-kind transfer is a \u2018transfer payment\u2019 that is \u2018made in a specific good or service rather than cash\u2019 (Cengage.com., 2013). There are 3 main types of in-kind transfers; the provision of vouchers such as food stamps, the use of subsidies and providing free access to a good or service, for example, the NHS in the UK. In-kind transfers allocate the benefit provided to specific goods or services, for example, the UK Healthy start scheme provides a targeted group with \u2018vouchers that can only be spent on specific healthy foods\u2019 (Griffith et al., 2018). It was found the impact these vouchers had upon raising utility depended on how highly the consumer values healthy foods. Diagram 1 shows the impact a healthy food voucher has upon infra-marginal consumers. Infra-marginal consumers already spend more than the vouchers worth on healthy foods as they value these goods highly and therefore a steep indifference curve is used. They are willing to sacrifice a high proportion of other goods to gain a small extra amount of healthy foods. In the diagram, the food voucher is represented by the line A-C. The voucher has caused an increase in utility for the consumer as represented by the rightward shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2. The original point of maximum utility is represented by point X and the new higher maximum utility point is represented by point Y. The provision of food vouchers to infra-marginal consumers has positively impacted utility. Whilst utility has increased, the impact the voucher has had upon these consumers is very \u2018similar to an income-equivalent cash benefit\u2019 (Griffith et al., 2018). This means that providing an unconditional cash transfer to these consumers instead of the vouchers would have a similar effect on utility. They are still likely to spend the additional cash on healthy foods. On the other hand, distorted consumers do not value healthy foods as highly and therefore the voucher has a different effect upon their utility. Diagram 2 displays the effect of the food voucher upon distorted consumers. The lower utility received from consuming healthy foods is represented by a flatter indifference curve and this displays the lower marginal rate of substitution. This means that in comparison to diagram 1 the initial maximum utility point X occurs at a much lower quantity of healthy foods. The voucher causes a shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2 and therefore increases the utility from point X to point C. This shows that the vouchers are effective in raising utility for this group of consumers. However, the line C-E represents the cash alternative of the voucher. Here we can see that if these consumers were provided with cash instead of vouchers the higher maximum utility point of Y can be reached. This shows that these consumers are unlikely to purchase healthy foods if provided with a cash alternative to the vouchers. They would instead choose to purchase a variety of other goods and services. For distorted consumers, the food vouchers are less effective in raising utility and the consumers would prefer to receive a cash payment. Unconditional cash transfer programmes \u2018aim to improve well-being by providing cash to targeted poor households without placing any conditions on the household\u2019s actions\u2019 (Institute for Financial Studies., 2018). Consumers are therefore not restricted on how they spend this money. Providing consumers with additional cash to spend effectively increases their income. The rational choice model assumes that consumers will act rationally and use any additional income to maximise utility. However, behavioural economics challenges this and suggests that the use of labels for these cash payments can influence how the consumer spends this additional money. Behavioural economics \u2018adds elements of psychology to traditional models in an attempt to gain a better understanding of decision making\u2019 (Sloman et al., 2018). For example, the UK Winter Fuel payment is a \u2018cash transfer to older households\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014). \u2018Robust evidence of a behavioural effect of labelling\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014) was found in relation to this unconditional cash transfer. The study found that \u2018on average households spend 47% of the WFP on fuel\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014). This is in comparison to an expected 3% being spent on fuel if the payment was simply treated as cash. Behavioural economic tools such as nudges can be used to alter how consumers spend their income. This is a clear example of nudge theory and shows that \u2018positive reinforcement\u2019 \u2018can persuade people to make a particular choice\u2019 (Sloman et al., 2018). \u2018When a label is attached to a part of their budget, subjects change consumption according to the label\u2019 (Abler et al., 2017). This evidence shows that consumers are responsive to behavioural economic policies and therefore do not always act like Homo Economicus as suggested by the rational choice model. Overall, rational choice theory suggests that unconditional cash transfers are more effective at raising consumers\u2019 utility. It allows consumers to purchase the goods and services they decide will maximise their own utility. However, in the long run, depending upon the area of consumption being targeted in-kind transfers may be more beneficial for raising overall welfare. For example, the healthy food vouchers provide families with food of a higher quality and that is more beneficial to their health. If they were instead provided with cash, as the distorted consumer example shows, there is a chance that this money would not be spend on healthy foods and instead it may be used to purchase fast food alternatives. This is then likely to have a long-term impact on health and could contribute to strains on the healthcare system in the future. If unconditional cash transfers are to be used, behavioural economic approaches can be adopted to influence how consumers spend this money to enable the intervention to have the most desired impact.", "positive": "k at this lmao Yep \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 On a post It\u2019s hilarious And it\u2019s a super old photo for sure Exactly Stealing the limelight I apologies for my mother \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Yes pleaseeeeeeeee I finish uni on So was going to suggest we do something ASAP!! \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 I\u2019m not completely sure as I\u2019m going to cover a few shifts at work so I\u2019ll find out tomorrow what they are!

{"id": "aug_894", "anchor": "Rationale: March 2020 when universities, schools, jobs, and lifestyle was put on hold for a four-month national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact of COVID-19 on the populations mental health has been major. The lockdown meant people had to stay home and isolate from loved ones and family members. This led to people experiencing anxiety and depression as they could not go out and enjoy their social life (Cao et al., 2020). The action orientated analysis aims to derive the importance of investigating potential discourses surrounding the topic of COVID-19 impact on student\u2019s mental health. Discourse analysis is based upon a semi structured interview collecting qualitative data (Smith., 1995) and focused on the research question, students\u2019 attitudes towards the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. The interview schedule in the appendices shows the formation of this question and constructs potential discourses such as mental health, students\u2019 lives, and future impact. Discourse analysis was chosen as the appropriate form of analysis for this investigation in order to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which students discuss and express their attitudes on COVID impact on mental health and how powerful this subject matter is in today\u2019s society. Willig (2015) showed how discourse analysis is suitable for a range of topics in order to assess the language, thus why it is appropriate for this topic. For confidentiality, the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Ellie in this analysis. Results: Discourse 1- \u2018loneliness is killing us\u2019. Ellie understands the mental impact COVID-19 has had on the general population. This is shown when she describes some experiences faced during the pandemic. In this extract Ellie explains how mental health has been a huge topic of conversation during the pandemic. Ellie suggests that due to lockdown many people\u2019s health and mental wellbeing has been affected as they have been stuck indoors for many months with hardly any social interaction or without seeing any family members. \"organisations have signposted mental health really well\" (line 30-31) suggesting that other businesses have done a better job than the government has done in helping mental health. She also touches upon the fact that people in care homes have had it rough as for many months they have not seen their loved ones leading to loneliness and further mental damage. The discourse of mental health shows what impact COVID-19 has had on many lives in today\u2019s society. Ellie suggests that many people in the future may face social anxiety as they have been stuck indoors with no other social interaction heading to increased social anxiety when meeting people again or not knowing how to interact anymore. This portrays that Ellie knows what is going on around her and is aware of the mental hardship many are facing during these unforeseen circumstances, however she feels as though she does not know what to do to help others. Ellie develops this discourse as a lack of social interaction the older generation has faced during this pandemic has had a mental and physical impact on many peoples lives. She suggests that due to the pandemic people are stuck indoors and many cant visit relatives in care homes or their houses as its dangerous causing \"isolation and loneliness\" (line 13). Ellie also mentions that many people may have loved ones in care homes who they cannot go and visit or may have to see them from a distance. This suggests that Ellie is worried about how families would cope with not seeing loved ones for so many months and how the deadly disease of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia can play a huge role during this pandemic. Ellies use of language and expression shows how worried she is for many families in this situation especially at these uncertain times. Discourse 2- \u2018Students trapped indoors\u2019. The impact of COVID-19 on students has been a running discourse throughout the whole interview. \"students feel like they are trapped indoors they cannot live like a student\u2019s\". portrays the anger Ellie feels when it comes to her views on the impact of the pandemic on university students, as Ellie herself is a first-year university student, she has many strong views on this discourse. Here Ellie explains the impact of COVID-19 on students\u2019 lives. She explains how university social life is non-existent as students cannot \"mix with other households\" this can be inferred as social isolation as Ellie feels like she cannot go out and meet others away from her flat she feels trapped with the same people every day who may not share same interests as her course mates who she cannot meet. This discourse shows Ellies frustration of being kept indoors and locked down from having fun and also enjoying what is meant to be university lifestyle. She feels as though her \"nightlife has been diminished\" (line 40) suggesting a growing concern of social isolation and not able to enjoy their prime childhood. Many goes on to explain how many students have moved to different parts of the country for university without their parents or loved ones and then thrown into social isolation. This can be traumatising for students at such a young age adding to loneliness and many other mental health problems. You can infer from Ellies speech that she is not happy with the handling of the pandemic for university students as they have no support from the government and are left to survive by themselves (lines 28-32). Ellie explains how many students are affected in schools. With the lockdown in March many schools were closed therefore students were at home for many months without having any homework or learning. Ellie spoke about how children \"lost interest and concentration\" and \"struggled fitting into school\" showing that she empathises with pupils as education is the most important at this age in order to build a strong future. She goes on to explain how children could not see their friends or teachers who may be their support and their happiness leading to loneliness and scared to go back to school as they have a loss in routine (70-73). From this we can infer that children at schools miss the social life of talking to their friends and having that support network as are too young to understand the implications of this pandemic, they just want to enjoy with their friends. This can induce loneliness and social boredom which is not great at such a young age. Ellie develops this discourse of acknowledging the fact that students may be disadvantaged in the job industry as many students are on cheap labour and are working parttime for minimum wage. This means that students are more likely to be made redundant as firms may not be able to afford to keep them on during this pandemic. Ellie recognises the harsh impact of students losing their jobs can have an impact on their mental health as the stress and anxiety of not being able to work to afford rent or their lifestyle can be a huge impact. Discourse 3- \u2018uncertain future\u2019 Ellie develops the discourse of uncertain future during this pandemic as many people may have struggled to cope with this year in general mentally and physically. With many Highstreet business and shops closing down Ellie does not know what the future will hold. She questions how the government debt will be paid off if people cannot afford to pay taxes. Ellie demonstrates what the future will look like in her eyes. With the increased government borrowing Ellie is worried how that would be paid back and if she will be able to pay it back as she is worried, she may not earn enough money due to a lack in jobs and a shrinking economy. She is also concerned about the population\u2019s future mental health, and how the long-term effects of the pandemic will play apart. As Ellie is a student, she is also worried about her student debt going up even though the debt is high in the first place as university is all online. She feels that university is a scam and is not worth the 9k she pays for online lectures. Ellie understands that it will take time to build the economy and lifestyle again and that as mental health has been well signposted, spoken about and made a topic of conversation many people may bounce back stronger than ever while using all the support given (lines 90-95). This shows that Ellie understands what the future will look like after the pandemic is over and how many people may overcome this trauma. Conclusion In conclusion the discourses throughout the interview shows the scared uncertain and worried student expressing views on the pandemic that is currently damaging our lives and our mental health. The increase in loneliness, anxiety, and depression amongst individual during this pandemic needs to be made a topic of conversation. There is a lot of help out there. Students have been greatly affected by this pandemic especially first year students as they have missed out on social events like freshers where they have chances to meet new people and make friends. This already adds to the loneliness as many of the students have moved away from home with not knowing anyone at their university. Many recent studies on the impact of the pandemic on mental health support Ellies views as mental health is on the decline due to anxiety depression and loneliness impacted by the lockdown and the isolation (Cullen et al., 2020). This analysis was from one transcript, this may not be enough to be generalised to others as many people may have had different experiences of the pandemic therefore this can be different for every individual.", "positive": ", My GCSE grades were B, B, C, B, C, C, B, C.

Best wishes, Hello , I received my mark for the presentation assessment over Christmas and I must admit, I was quite disappointed! Apologies for the delay in bringing this up, thought it was best to wait until I was back at university. After looking through the feedback provided I'm left quite confused on how my grade was decided. There seems to be lots of feedback on each slide which would usually be great, but I was under the impression that we were being marked solely on our response to the feedback i.e. critical reflection? Or were we also meant to change the rest of the slides following the presentation? I found the task very difficult as we were given such positive feedback on our presentation, I didn't feel like I had very much to work with for this task! I understand all of your negative points raised about our main slides, but as we did not receive that feedback at the time, I'm unsure of how I was meant to make any changes to that for my submission. Following this, you made comments about me not changing the text-heavy slides for my submission. I understand its a bit of an eye-sore but I saw no other way of getting all the information we spoke about in our presentation onto the limited number of slides. Were we meant to have left them as bullet points without the key info when submitting? Sorry for all of the questions - just hoping to better understand the rationale behind the marking. Many thanks, Hi , Yes this is correct, I have been offered a position with . However, I would like to hold off on the paperwork on the university's side for now if possible.

{"id": "aug_913", "anchor": "1.Outline the proposed role of dopamine in the maintenance of drug use Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is associated with pleasure and reward, eating, drinking and sex are examples of reward process that stimulate dopamine production. In evolutionary terms dopamine naturally encourages behaviour that is vital to live such as eating when one is hungry. The nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area are important areas in the brain associated with production of dopamine(Lecture notes). Drugs cause a rush or high- pleasurable feelings and this results in associating the drugs with the feeling. In terms of maintenance of drug use,when drugs such as cocaine are used, dopamine levels are intense and even after use dopamine levels are still high causing one to have almost a greater feeling of \u2018pleasure\u2019 leading to intense cravings and intense. This is in comparison to the levels of dopamine produced in natural activities such as eating, after eating one is basically satisfied and the dopamine levels decrease. Dopamine levels being high leads to continued use of the drug to get the \u2018high\u2019. Additionally, it's common in long term drug users that the number of dopamine receptors decrease leading to depressive feelings.(Heshmati et al, 2015). These depressive feelings would lead to increased use of the drug to achieve the pleasurable feelings, this is a cycle and the drug use is maintained. 2.Outline the potential role of epigenetics in explaining familial transmission of phobias Epigenetics is defined as the change in the phenotype but the genetic code stays the same. Genes are turned off or on causing changes which are heritable, this is a result of external factors eg the environment and experiences.(Hamilton J, P: Epigenetics 2011) A study on mice who were placed in a skinner box and electrocuted showed the familial transmission of phobias, these mice were electrocuted when placed in the skinner box, as a result they formed a phobia of being placed in a skinner box, associating the electrocution (pain) with the box. The mice then produced offspring, which were placed into the skinner box without electrocution but showed a fear response. Epigenetics is the only answer as these mice had never been electrocuted and there was no reason for them to associate pain with the skinner box. Evolutionary studies have also suggested that we are born with snake and spider phobias as our ancestors were less likely to notice them, as they are small and discreet but still harmful. Our ancestors had to be more aware of them whereas lions and bears are easy to spot.(Russell et al, 2015) 3. Critically evaluate the evidence that schizophrenia is caused by excess dopamine in the brain The original dopamine hypothesis stated that schizophrenia was a result of excess dopamine. Evidence to support this includes the amphetamine psychosis, which is a result of taking amphetamines.(J\u00f8rgen G et al, 2012)The symptoms of amphetamine psychosis mirror symptoms of schizophrenia. The use of amphetamines also increases the amount of dopamine in the brain so for researchers this was a direct link to schizophrenia.Also, researchers found that by giving schizophrenia sufferers small doses of dopamine their symptoms worsened. The dopamine hypothesis however is biologically reductionist, there have been studies showing that there are other factors such as the environment to schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis attempts to explain schizophrenia just in terms of biology, it simplifies and generalises when the condition is much more than biology and this can be shown in the diathesis stress model. Another weakness of the dopamine hypothesis to explain schizophrenia is the correlation is not equal causation issue. There isn't sufficient evidence to show whether schizophrenia causes high dopamine levels or high dopamine levels cause schizophrenia. Outline three different brain research techniques and mention one strength and one weakness for each. Fmri- functional magnetic resonance imaging. A type of imaging technique that measures blood flow in parts of the brain when participants are asked to perform tasks. One strength of this technique is that it has high spatial resolution meaning it is able to show part exactly of the brain exactly where the blood is being used to perform tasks. FMRI tracks blood flow, as blood flow shows that a particular part of the brain is using oxygen. A weakness of this technique is that it has poor temporal resolution, brain activity can not be tracked accurately, there is a time delay of 4 to 6 seconds, this is because an FMRI scan is not able to quickly track the change in blood flow. EEG- electroencephalography is a technique where electrodes are used to measure neural activity in the brain. Temporal resolution for this technique is excellent and you can see directly the neural activity in the brain, however a weakness for EEG would be the fact it doesn't tell us anything about brain structures and the dynamics of the brain it just shows electrical potential in the brain. (Sturzbecher M.J., de Araujo D.B. (2012))The third research technique is MEG- Magnetoencephalography, it measures the magnetic field that are produced in the brain, this technique is much better in comparison to EEG in terms of spatial resolution, parts of the brain can be localised well however a massive issue is the fact that this technique is expensive and not economic that's why it is so rare. 2.Describe the stress response, with reference to both the neural and hormonal components The stress response is also called the fight or flight response, this is the body\u2019s biological process to stress. This is triggered by something that could cause harm and our body is deciding to literally fight or flight, this is in order to survive.When the threat is recognised, the hypothalamus triggers the autonomous nervous system,which is rapid, and the endocrine system which is a bit slower in action. The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland which causes release of ACTH hormone, this hormone then causes the release of cortisol which is known as the stress hormone. The autonomous nervous system on the other hand works more rapidly and it causes the adrenal medulla to release adrenaline and noradrenaline and other stress hormones.(Goldstein 2010) These hormones are both useful in the state of stress for an organism. The 2 hormones increase heart rate and breathing, this is also to help with running or escaping the threat. Other physical changes happen as a result of this,pupils are dilated, rectum is contracted, there is also more blood flow to areas of the body which would be in more need such as the brain and less blood to places such as the digestive system. Give an example and brief explanation of three neurodevelopmental disorders: one caused mainly by genetic factors, one mainly caused by environmental factors and one that demonstrates gene-environment interactions. Down Syndrome is mainly caused by genetic factors. Those with down syndrome normally suffer from learning difficulties. This disorder happens as a result of there being 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of just 2. A disorder mainly caused by environmental factors is foetal alcohol syndrome, this is characterised by physical and also mental disability which is caused by brain damage to the fetus as a result of the mother\u2019s alcohol uptake during the pregnancy. The severity depends on how much the mother was drinking and the severity of it.(Paediatr Child Health. 2002). ASD- autism spectrum disorder is a disorder which demonstrates gene-environment interaction. Outline the main structural components of the human brain, and describe 3 different examples of localisation of function within the brain. 6.The main structural components of the human brain are the cerebellum, cerebrum and brainstem. One example of localisation is study on Phineas Gage was involved in a traumatic accident which resulted in him losing a large part of his left frontal lobe, after his insicident his personality and mood changed massively.(LF HAAS, 2001)The left frontal lobe is associated with mood regulation and social behaviour which explained the change in phineas gage.Another example is the motor cortex, this part is associated with performing voluntary movements, damage to this area is likely to end in someone struggling to perform complicated tasks in terms of movement. One of the most famous examples for localisation of brain function is the study by Carl Wernicke.Wernicke\u2019s aphasia is the damaged left temporal lobe, this part of the brain is associated with language, this results in the inability to produce speech that makes sense, the speech is fluent however it doesn't make any sense and there is a lack of comprehension.(Binder, 2015)", "positive": "Radisson Blu Seaside hotel - \u00c2\u00a3187 for 2 nights Cargo breakfast cafe, 1 min drive from the hotel Konstan Molja, traditional food restaurant with lots of variety not just seafood, 1 min drive from the hotel National museum of Finland, good reviews, most popular for history of Finland, 7 min drive from hotel Annensoppi souvenir shop, good souvenirs for kids and adults, 7 mins drive from hotel Apollo live club, live music and no opera, 6 min drive", "positive_attacked": "Radisson Blu Seaside hotel - \u00c2\u00a3187 for 2 nights Cargo breakfast cafe, 1 min drive from the hotel Konstan Molja, traditional food restaurant with lots of variety not just seafood, 1 min drive from the hotel National museum of Finland, good reviews, most popular for history of Finland, 7 min drive from hotel Annensoppi souvenir shop, good souvenirs for kids and adults, 7 mins drive from hotel Apollo live club, live music and no opera, 6 min drive", "label": 1}

So whenever you get some time to yourself I would highly recommend for you to give it a listen when you have some time. Best wishes, Hi , Thanks for the email. I\u2019m quite well actually. The weathers been really nice recently so there\u2019s not much complain about there. I try to get out at least once daily and go for a walk to enjoy the weather or just to get out of the monotony of being stuck at home. My placements going well. We still have weekly meetings on where we\u2019re usually updated with what different members of the group are doing and updates with their research. I still have close contact with my placement supervisor and he has been really helpful. Also, I do contact my placement tutor as and when I need to and he\u2019s been really supportive as well. I have a presentation task that I\u2019ve been given to present a piece of research I find interesting which links to the area of research as well as meeting certain criteria. Also, tomorrow I am going to take part in an online study which is all about to do with me experience studying at . So that\u2019s my update. What about you ? How have you been and how has working in lockdown and recording lectures been like?

{"id": "aug_916", "anchor": "Parenting Is defined by \u2018Purposive activities aimed at ensuring the survival and development of children (Hoghugi, 2004); these activities ensure the children to be effective citizens within society. Various research has contributed to our understanding of the impact of parenting within child development, concerning parent rearing styles, socioeconomic background, alongside the demands which come with parenthood. Research into parenting styles has helped in our understanding of parenting on child development, about investigating the relationship between the type of occupation depended on social class and parenting styles. As white-collar workers require the individual to deal more with the creative ideas, symbols, and interpersonal realities, whilst blue-collar workers are required to conform to external standards such as orderliness, neatness, and obedience (Gecas &amp; Nye, 1974; Kohn, 1969). From these contrasting two occupations research suggests that this essentially has influence in child-rearing styles to the child development concerning the socialisation of the child within society, alongside with their identity and values; as those of a lower-class may emphasise obedience and respect to authority to their children in comparison to middle-upper class parents who may encourage initiative, curiosity, and creativity to their child (Greenberger, O\u2019Neil,&amp; Nagel, 1994). This research evidence can be perceived as reliable in contributing to our understanding of the indirect impact of parenting on child development, as various studies also support the notion of socioeconomic status influencing parenting and child development. This is evident as research shows that poor conditions within the workplace such as a busy day, high workload, and higher job demands are related to poor parenting behaviour (Repetti 1992, 1994). This is further supported by research by Repetti et al, (1991) which showed that fluctuations in job stressors experienced by male air traffic controllers contributed to the absence of the father, this consisted of fewer high involvement interactions and less monitoring and help with the children\u2019s schoolwork. Simultaneously, mothers with a variety of occupational status and heavy workloads also have less involvement and more withdrawal from children. Moreover, it can also be argued that this research aids in our understanding, as it does not have a bias about the role of father as solely a breadwinner but values the importance of father and child interaction in the development of the child. This non-traditional family approach to investigating the relationship between parenting and child development increases the mundane realism of the findings with today\u2019s society with variations in family dynamics; especially with the consideration of the crucial role of the father in a child\u2019s development. Baumrind's (1967) three patterns of parenting styles Authoritarian, Permissive, and Authoritative has contributed to our understanding of the impact of parenting on child development. Glasgow et al (1997) state that \u2018Authoritarian parents are highly demanding and unresponsive\u2019; this consists of the parent attempting to control and mould the behaviour of their children according to a set standard. This parenting style has increased our understanding with the supporting evidence which shows its effect on child development. As evidence shows that children from authoritarian families more prone to levels of perfectionism, critical attitudes, and anxiety (Randall, Bohner, &amp; Travers, 2015), alongside low academic achievement. The second parenting style is authoritative parenting this consists of maintaining an effective balance between high levels of demandingness and responsiveness, alongside being warm and supportive parents. This style is found to be the most effective parenting style concerning school achievement. As a result of encouraging bidirectional communication between both the child and parent (Glasgow et al., 1997, p.508). In addition to this, the warm and affectionate relationship between children and parents promote cognitive growth in children (Maccoby &amp; Martin, 1983; Baumrind, 1973, 1979). The final parenting style is Permissive, this consists of a \u2018more responsive than they are demanding approach\u2019, therefore leading to little or no discipline for the child. This style has contributed to the impact of this parenting on child development. This is apparent within the findings of Sahithya, et al. (2020) which illustrated that a significant association with permissive parenting style and the sociability and emotionality of the child, alongside increased anxiety levels. These parenting styles can be seen as effective with the supporting evidence in regard to it touching all the spheres of the child development such as school achievement, mental health, and the socialisation the child, in comparison to adopting a narrow approach on child development such as the child\u2019s behaviour alone. However, it can be argued that there is a cultural bias within the research of parenting styles with its influence on child development. As cultures may perceive a parenting style as a more favourable and beneficial contribution to their child development; Authoritarian parenting in Asian cultures is perceived as more effective as they hold the belief that tough love leads to success (You &amp; Malley-Morrison 2000). Therefore, from this it can be argued that based upon various cultural viewpoints on parenting styles it will be difficult to see the impact of parenting styles within a child\u2019s development as there appears to be no distinct correct style of parenting. Finally, it can also be argued that a parent\u2019s mental health may also have influenced a child\u2019s development. This is apparent based upon the difficulties that come with parenthood, such as sleep deprivation, finical stress, strained partner relationship (Nelson et al.,2014); essentially affecting the wellbeing of the parent affects the child\u2019s development. This is further supported by Goodman et al, (2011) which found that there was an association between maternal depression and a child\u2019s negative behaviour and psychopathology. To conclude, it is evident that there is an association between parenting and child development, with the influence on parenting styles, the socio-economic status of the parent, alongside with the well-being of the parent. From these aspects it can be concluded that various aspects of the parent\u2019s life solely have a direct and indirect effect on child development.", "positive": "I don\u2019t know it just won\u2019t turn in Your parcel is coming today at 10am - 12pm Was the panic scary I\u2019ve never seen her panic before Do u want me to buy anting for you to cheer you up a bit c How much of your assigment do u have left Yeahh do that Sent x Good luck for your exam today !

{"id": "aug_917", "anchor": "This essay will focus on how well FIFA have responded to the 2015 corruption scandal and an in-depth look into the measures they have since taken to prevent bribery being used within FIFA. By looking at different views and academic disciplines to critically evaluate if FIFA have done enough to prevent corruption and bribery continuing within their organisation. Background: FIFA, an organisation people all over the world are familiar with. In 2002 213 countries broadcast the FIFA world cup making it the most watched event in television history. The reach and influence FIFA has is vast. FIFA is a non-profit organisation which describes itself as the international governing body of association football. FIFA was established in 1904 by 7 different nations. The global network and sensation surrounding FIFA Led them to generating $4.6 billion in 2018. In 2015 an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) lead to 14 people being indicted surrounding widespread allegations of corruption, wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering within FIFA. There were allegations that $115 million in bribes were handed over to FIFA officials for several reasons. This case caused several arrests to be made in different countries across the world such as Australia, Columbia, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Germany. This case has been ongoing for several years and allegations of corruption within FIFA have been circulating for many more. In 2002 a FIFA whistle-blower contacted a British journalist with allegations of corruption within FIFA. Later there was a book written by the same journalist (Andrew Jennings) documentary about the corruption and the World Cup this led to the FBI contacting Jennings. Since then more and more information from investigators and whistle-blowers has come to light about bribes and corruption going on within FIFA mainly regarding World Cup\u2019s and where they will be held. Countries were bribing FIFA officials to accept their bid for the World Cup to be held in their country. The investigation has found out that there was bribery involved in Qatar\u2019s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup. In December 2014 FIFA had conducted their own investigation into the allegations of corruption however they did not release the findings of this investigation but just an executive summary. In which they claimed to have exonerated the bidding process of corruption. This decision shows that in 2014 they were not willing to make any major changes or take responsibility for the corruption and bribery that took place. These actions could show FIFAs unwillingness to change these practices and shows in the future it will still be standard practice for FIFA to take bribes. 2022 World Cup: There are many arguments surrounding the FIFA scandal some people argue that Qatar should not be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup as it effectively rewards their actions and involvement in the corruption. There are arguments that it would be inappropriate to allow a controversial state to host the World Cup and have such a large platform. The fact that this corruption harms so many people it breaches the ethics of virtues. There are already red flags being raised about the 2022 World Cup and the fact that for the first time in its history it will be held in the winter due to the temperatures in the summer in the middle east. Anti-corruption expert Sylvia Schenk believes that if there was a legal dispute regarding this it would not be resolved until at least 2028 at which point it is ineffective. Between the scandal in 2015 and the World Cup that is due to take place in 2022 there have been many years and many different chances for FIFA officials to set a precedent and show that they are committed to stamping the corruption out of FIFA. One way to achieve this would be to allow another country to host the 2022 World Cup. It has been argued that this would not be too difficult as many countries have the infrastructure e.g., stadiums set up to accommodate the World Cup therefore logistics should not be an issue here. This shows that FIFA do not appear to have taken anything away from the scandal and try and change for the better. Human Rights: The issues regarding the 2015 scandal are still Widely debated 2021. With Qualifying stages of the 2022 World Cup starting players have been protesting the allegations of human rights of migrant workers being breached in Qatar due to host the 2022 World Cup. The Guardian revealed in February 2021 that since Qatar won the bid to host the tournament in 2010 over 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar. However, this shocking statistic could be misleading it is impossible to know how many of these deaths are related to human rights breaches and how many are related to the World Cup. This however does not look good for FIFA or Qatar surrounding this global event especially as 37 deaths have been directly linked to the construction of the stadiums. This issue that is gaining global traction due partly to Norway who on the 24th of March protested by wearing T-shirts during the warmup which read \"human rights on and off the pitch \"in their World Cup qualifying match. Other teams have started to follow suit by wearing T-shirts raising awareness of the problem. Kimmich has argued that teams are 10 years too late to boycott. The damage has already been done and Qatar have been allowed to get away with this for far too long protests should have been taking place when Qatar was allocated the World Cup and before they started building all the stadiums. However, The German football Federation is not in favour of boycotting the World Cup. So, all the T-shirt wearing in the world will not help the migrant workers that have died or will continue to die for this World Cup or others to come. This is yet another example of a time where FIFA have sat back and let corruption run rife within its organisation six years after the corruption scandal this therefore shows they have not made major improvements or changes to stop his from happening for many more years to come. Social Responsibility: It is not just a legal field that believes FIFA are problematic. It is argued that FIFA are also corrupt in terms of their corporate social responsibility. In a 2014 study it was found that corporations and companies that sponsored FIFA were disliked more and trusted less by the public and people are more likely to negatively talk about these brands with their peers. This study can be very negative for FIFA and the many brands that pay them millions in sponsorship. This could cause massive problems for FIFA in the future if corporations and brands the sponsor that events decide that they do not want to be associated any more. This is one example of how the corruption scandal has negatively impacted FIFA is brand and therefore value. Therefore, correcting and changing this public perception will be crucial to FIFAs continued success. Feminist Perspective: There is also a view that FIFA is a \"boys club\". Professional tennis player Billie Jean King has tried to advocate for FIFA to hire more female managers and to appoint more females into higher roles within the company and hire someone specifically for the purpose of regulating gender equality within the company. She also raises a point that having more women within FIFA could improve the culture of corruption that exists. There have been studies that show that women are less likely to be involved in bribery and are less likely to condone bribe taking. Data from different countries shows that corruption is less severe where women held more seats in parliament or more senior positions and comprise of a larger share of the labour force. Therefore, viewing this issue from the feminist perspective one way FIFA could counter some corruption could be to employ women in more positions and in more senior roles. However, it could be argued that this is less of a gender difference and more of a culturally based issue in however due to the global nature of FIFA this could potentially make a difference. The fact that some of these issues were raised years ago and have not been acted upon shows once again that FIFA are not dedicated to eradicating corruption. Legalities: FIFA is registered and incorporated under swiss law. It is a very attractive base for many international organisations not only due to its location and political stability Switzerland also has most importantly a very lenient legal code and attractive tax regime. This could be one of the reasons that attracted FIFA to incorporate itself there. Switzerland is perceived to be a country that is least affected by corruption however this does not prevent organisations that are located there being involved in corruption. Article 332 of the Swiss criminal code only refers to the bribery of a public official as criminal therefore there is no criminal liability for the bribery of officials in international sports organisations such as FIFA. It could be argued that this is one of the reasons that corruption and bribery has run rampant within FIFA for so many years. It could be argued that under the Swiss federal act on unfair competition the type of bribery happening within FIFA could be criminally prosecuted. However transparency International believe that it is unclear whether this would be applicable to sport and FIFA. In 2004 the Federal Council ruled that this article did not apply to non-governmental organisations e.g. FIFA. There have been moves made by the Swiss Parliament to change the law so that Bribery that does not involve public officials can be criminally charged. This was following a recommendation from GRECO. This accountability should prevent more bribes taking place within FIFA. Geography: The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates a situation where it is impossible for one country to be able to keep track and punish such a large organisation. FIFA is a billion-pound empire that effectively has the ability to punish countries this makes them untouchable. This system negatively affects smaller and poorer countries. Morocco was also competing for the 2022 World Cup and after spending millions on the campaign they lost out to Qatar due to the bribes Qatar paid to FIFA officials. Currently 32 teams and subsequently 32 countries play in the World Cup, FIFA have been discussing pushing this to 48 countries. Bringing more countries in to the World Cup could potentially reduce corruption and bribery as that is more accountability and even more countries will be watching them. However, this could go the other way and now there are 16 more countries that could be involved in bribery. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup they denied Morocco the chance to host the World Cup. It could be argued that Morocco deserve the World Cup more as they are a smaller economy and the World Cup would have benefited them more than Qatar. It could also be argued that after the bribery Qatar used to gain the world cup came to light Morocco should have been awarded the World Cup. There has been talks of Spain Portugal and Morocco teaming up for a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup however Spain and Portugal signed a joint bid agreement and left Morocco out once again this could be devastating for Morocco\u2019s economy. There have been studies into GDP and corruption. Qatar\u2019s GDP is 175.8 billion c compared to Morocco\u2019s 119.7 both in 2019. The study indicates that the poorer country the more likely they are to be susceptible to corruption however in this example that does not seem to be the case as based on GDP Qatar has more wealth but clearly, they were more susceptible to bribery. Psychology: There are many Psychological theories and there has been lots of research completed in regards to bribery and corruption. One of the main theories that comes from psychological studies is the trust game. This was first created by Berg et al the results from the study were surprising and went against the standard economic theory upon which they were based. The theory and results of this study can be applied to FIFA the anonymity and scale of the bribery makes it easier for people to be corrupted as there is a level of anonymity. One problem with this theory is that the study was done in 1995 on a very small population therefore the results cannot be generalised to modern society and the global society where customs cultures and values vary massively. Studies like this one tend to be studied by white men and study white men therefore there is massive gender and racial bias involved in the results of this study which reduce the effectiveness of it outside of the context of a single study. Similar studies were conducted that compared data from many different countries to see if there was a relationship between nationality and the likelihood to take or condone bribery. The study found that collectivism versus individualism on a national scale was the fact and most likely to affect bribery. This theory seems to line up with Qatar as it has a very large wealth divide. This divide makes it much easier for people to take part in bribes. In 1995 there was a cross national study focusing on ethics this study found that there was substantial crossover between personality values but the moral reasoning very significantly. The psychologists use social cognitive theory to explain the practical implications of this study. This could explain why some countries are more likely to be involved in bribery than others due to social cognitive theory and shared values of a society. There are many different areas of psychology that relate directly to bribery and corruption and the FIFA scandal. These theories should be able to show a way for bribery to be reduced in the future. This can be seen using the evolutionary psychology principle. This theory states that there are distinct patterns of corruption that can be seen throughout history with the FIFA 2015 corruption scandal named as one. This theory explains that social and cultural norms have evolved over time to allow to happen more freely. This could be good news for FIFA as it could explain why so much bribery has happened within the organisation and it could help reduce their blame and liability for the bribery. This theory can also show how to reduce bribery within FIFA in the future. Legal Case: The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates and in capability of anyone to be able to keep try and punish such a large organisation. FIFA is billion-pound empire that effectively has the ability to punish countries this makes them untouchable. This system negatively affects smaller and poorer countries. Morocco was also competing for the 2022 World Cup and after spending millions on the campaign they lost out to Qatar due to the bribes Qatar paid to FIFA officials. Currently 32 teams and subsequently 32 countries play in the World Cup, FIFA have been discussing pushing this to 48 countries. Bringing more countries in to the World Cup could potentially reduce corruption and bribery as that is more accountability and even more countries will be watching them. However, this could go the other way and now there are 16 more countries that could be involved in bribery. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup they Denied Moscow the chance to host the World Cup. It could be argued that Morocco deserve the World Cup more as they are a smaller economy and the World Cup would have benefited them more than guitar. It could also be argued that after the truck in time like Morocco should have been awarded the World Cup. There has been talks of Spain Portugal and Morocco teaming up for a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup however Spain and Portugal signed a joint bid agreement and left Morocco out once again this could be devastating for Morocco\u2019s economy. There have been studies into GDP and corruption. Catarrhs GDP is 175.8 billion c compared to Morocco\u2019s 119.7 both in 2019. The study indicates that the poorer country the more likely they are to be susceptible to corruption however in this example that does not seem to be the case as base of GDP Qatar has more wealth but clearly, they were more susceptible to bribery. To conclude it appears that FIFA have not done everything in their power to prevent further corruption happening since the 2015 scandal. However, it is a very large and complex issue that covers many legal and political jurisdictions. This therefore makes it very hard to give definitive answer to how well FIFA dealt with the scandal. From my research for this essay, I have come across many recommendations for how FIFA could reduce bribery and corruption from so many different academic disciplines and the fact that FIFA has not implemented any of the shows FIFA has not learnt from 2015. On balance it appears they have not made enough changes to prevent this from happening again.", "positive": "at thank you so much!

Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging \u00c2\u00a3163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros.

{"id": "aug_921", "anchor": ", Are there any s still available this semester for to book in an ? Happy to have a meeting with you to discuss plans so its better organised this time! Best wishes, Hello , I received my mark for the presentation assessment over Christmas and I must admit, I was quite disappointed! Apologies for the delay in bringing this up, thought it was best to wait until I was back at university. After looking through the feedback provided I'm left quite confused on how my grade was decided. There seems to be lots of feedback on each slide which would usually be great, but I was under the impression that we were being marked solely on our response to the feedback i.e. critical reflection? Or were we also meant to change the rest of the slides following the presentation? I found the task very difficult as we were given such positive feedback on our presentation, I didn't feel like I had very much to work with for this task! I understand all of your negative points raised about our main slides, but as we did not receive that feedback at the time, I'm unsure of how I was meant to make any changes to that for my submission. Following this, you made comments about me not changing the text-heavy slides for my submission.

{"id": "aug_932", "anchor": "Johns Case: John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010). Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: John\u2019s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John\u2019s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992). Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so. John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017). As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008), who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008). John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood. Coping: John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance. In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). Interventions: The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and has little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007). Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": ", Thanks for this.

{"id": "aug_946", "anchor": "Johns Case: John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010). Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: John\u2019s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John\u2019s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992). Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so. John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017). As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008), who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008). John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood. Coping: John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance. In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). Interventions: The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and has little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007). Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": ", I do have some sort of timetable on now, I'm not sure if it was the team or not but I received an email yesterday saying that my timetable was released and following that it was working on .

So, what I can understand from the university updates via email is that term 1 (Second year of university - ) will consist of mainly online teaching but some on-campus learning. I wanted to know and confirm whether it would okay for me to stay here and continue with my online learning here in . In regard to on-campus learning, I would make use of the resources available online and make my tutors also aware. For example, if there are seminars I would do the work and reading notes electronically and then send them to my seminar leaders and interact with students I know from that class but online instead.

{"id": "aug_956", "anchor": "This strategy paper will focus on suggesting realistic solutions to the problem of educational gender inequality in India. This inequality is a clear problem; unequal access to education is an infringement of human rights. If this gender disparity was lessened, the well-being and development of children would be positively impacted, as well as the economy of the country itself (Fuller, 2019). To tackle this issue, proposed strategies could take the form of implementing new legislative reforms that aid families in the struggles they face, as well as reforming teaching throughout India in order to help eradicate damaging cultural and social norms. The paper will begin by firstly explaining the main problems within the education sector in India and will then highlight the importance of achieving gender equality in education. The main body of the paper will entail a detailed analysis of the current strategies and legislation in place as well as non-governmental reforms made by different organisations. The paper will then move towards a focus on the suggested strategies that could be incorporated into the current education system to alleviate gender inequalities and will be compared to the successes of educational reform in Sweden. This will include a description of the targets for the reforms, instruments to aid reform, and the target groups at which reforms are aimed at. The paper will conclude with a summary of the findings from this research and ways to ensure the successful implementation of new strategies. Why is this a problem? There are two primary factors that can limit the education of girls in India: cultural traditions and poverty. In terms of cultural traditions, there are several reasons that this issue can play a significant role in the educational disparity between genders. Firstly, the miseducation of parents about the importance of schools for girls and the costings of education itself thus leads to families becoming reluctant to educate girls within the household. Research shows that parents are more willing to send their girls to school if they had access to more information about school (Maertens, 2011). Furthermore, it is said that gender discrimination within household expenditure and education has resulted in the inadequate progress of educating of women in many countries across the world, and thus ingrains this issue into the societal framework of such countries (Saha, 2013). This is also reinforced by the low literacy rates in India. The correlation between low literacy rates among men and women indicates that the miseducation of parents can affect the education of girls because they themselves have had inadequate education, and it is difficult for them to understand the importance of it, further highlighting the gender inequalities between men and women through previous social norms. For example, the 2011 literacy rates of women were 57.93% compared to men which were 77.15% (Pathania, 2020) demonstrating gender disparities and how poverty can be a factor in gender inequalities within education. Poverty plays an important role in the lack of education for girls. Daughters from families that face social pressures to get married are more likely to only complete minimum education, as shown in a study of three rural villages in India, where only 39% of girls were allowed by their parents to pursue higher education, compared to the 71% of boys who would go into further education (Maertens, 2013). Furthermore, educating women is not prioritised in the household as it stops the income that would otherwise be earned from girls going straight into work rather than staying in school. Therefore, working and earning can be seen to be put on a pedestal instead for the many families facing financial difficulties (Hebert, 2020). Why is this an important issue for gender equality? As UNICEF has stated, the educational advancement of girls is the most effective way of combatting challenges to human development, so it is important to expand educational access and overcome cultural norms to achieve this (Ross, Shah &amp; Wang, 2011). Inequalities within education are important to the issue of gender equality, as even though India emerges as one of the top three countries for higher education (Bazaz &amp; Akram, 2020), in certain states such as Uttar Pradesh, only 33.20% of women are educated compared to the 73.40% of men who are educated, highlighting that there are severe problems within the education system that disadvantage women. Furthermore, this can lead to other problems such as a gender gap in the labour market, as if employers value a woman\u2019s education less than that of a man\u2019s, and therefore there are fewer economic incentives to educate women, which subsequently affects the economy and the wellbeing of women (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Another factor that makes this issue important is that the education of girls further reduces the risks they face, such as abuse and child marriage, as currently, a third of child brides worldwide are in India (Sahni, 2018). Moreover, better education for girls reduces the risks of child labour in poorer families to ensure the survival of their households, as the hourly wages of a child with higher school education are 8.97% higher compared to a child with no schooling, leading to less exploitation (Chamarbagwala, 2008). Attempted strategies to achieve gender equality in education There have been many attempts in India to close the gender gaps in education, through both legal and social means. The main legislative reform introduced was the Right to Education Act in 2009, in which, all children between 6 and 14 years of age are required to complete primary school education. This reform has proven successful as enrolment between 2013-14 increased from 43.8% to 48.2% (Sahni, 2018). However, its success still proves limited on the gender equality front as a UNESCO report detailed that of the 95% of children who attended primary school, only 40% continued onto secondary education, in which, a small fraction of the 40% were girls (Modi, 2017). Attempts have also been made to reform the curriculum. However, this failed due to the response of disadvantaged schools towards the issue of gender equality: an attempt was made to create a new system where boys of different abilities were paired with girls, but this meant the educational interests of girls were sacrificed, therefore showing little to no development in changing gender inequalities in schools (Charlton, 2007). Secondly, a non-legislative reform that was made to combat gender inequality in education was the KGBV programme introduced in 2004. The goal of the programme was to increase children\u2019s, and in particular girls, access to the curriculum and to improve teaching standards. This began successfully as two Indian states partnered with CARE India (a non-governmental organisation) to introduce KGBV schools that were single-sex and employ a non-traditional curriculum. The KGBV school initiative was shown to be successful as they were more inclusive than state schools, as children of all castes could attend, which also allowed the new schools challenged harmful social norms. However, the success was limited as the KGBV programme did not focus on education above seventh grade where school dropout rates for girls are the highest (Shah, 2015). Finally, the most successful attempt at improving gender inequality in education was by ANK, a non-profit organisation with an aim to empower girls. ANK set up in 10 rural villages and introduced several initiatives for girls including: bicycle banks in 2002 to improve access to schools for girls, a life skills education programme out of school hours, a scholarship programme, and a karate programme. The implementation of these programmes showed great promise as 1,100 girls achieved a scholarship and 1,000 girls were given access to bikes. It was found that the combination of the bicycle bank and the life skills education programme led to the best education outcomes for girls. However, the bicycle bank programme was discontinued and this programme only reached a small number of girls, so, nationally, gender disparities remained high (Modi, 2017). Proposed Strategies My first proposed strategy is to subsidise costs for school by 50% for low-income families; as mentioned above, many parents selectively choose their male children to attend school rather than their female children, because of financial difficulties. Therefore, subsidising the costs of schooling can enable equal opportunities for girls. This has proved successful in countries such as Sweden, where pre-schooling costs have been subsidised for lower-income families, in order to equalise opportunities for all and ensure substantial educational attainment for both males and females (Bjorklund, Clark, Edin, Fredricksson &amp; Krueger, 2006). Success can be seen clearly when compared to India, a large 79% of the students go on to secondary school in Sweden (European Commission, 2017) against a mere 40% in India, in which, the ratio of boys to girls is equal in Sweden unlike in India (Modi, 2017). Additionally, another legislative reform that could be introduced is to improve families\u2019 access to daycare and after school care, so that parents can work, alleviating any stresses on children providing additional household income. A similar policy proved successful in Sweden (Sweden, 2020), in which a right to daycare was introduced in the 1990s for working parents to alleviate financial pressure (Fritzell, Hvinden, Kautto, Kvist &amp; Uusitalo, 2001). Furthermore, there has been evidence to suggest that altering the way teachers are trained helps to promote gender equality and eradicate bias in the classroom. In a proposed system called REFLECT, teachers are given criteria that they must meet, including creating a suitable learning environment for female and male children - this could prove beneficial in India (Kollmayer, 2020). The next proposed strategy is an extension of the work of ANK with the bicycle banks and life skills education programme (Modi, 2017) as it proved successful but stopped due to a lack of funding. This would enable a focus on the education of girls and give them access to adequate teaching, which in turn reaps enormous benefits economically, socially, and mentally, especially in terms of the wellbeing of girls in India. It would also help to elevate the goal of India to become more gender-inclusive, as currently, their progress for gender equality remains slow and they stand at a ranking of 132 out of 187 countries (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Sequentially, to enable parents of girls to realise the importance of education, it is vital to recruit them as allies in the movement against gender inequalities in education. To do this, parents\u2019 evenings could be introduced for teachers to educate parents in schooling and other matters that put girls at risk such as child marriage. Research shows that parents evenings are important in the development of a child and important for the parents themselves as they are responsible for making key decisions that impact the future of their children (Fefer, 2020), highlighting how this can also be a way to communicate the positive prospects for girls with the aid of education. To conclude, it is prevalent that actions must be taken within education legislation and within the households of girls to combat the problem of gender inequality within education. The government must take steps to support families of lower incomes so as to ensure no one is denied equal opportunity to education. This will reduce child labour rates, increase literacy rates, and improve India\u2019s ranking on the gender equality index, as well as increasing the economic status of many civilians in India. With the increased education of girls, it will help to combat harmful social norms in the future, preventing young girls from the fate of child marriage, abuse, and exploitation. With reforms in teaching, they could allow for long-lasting changes within education, as it means they can be the main drivers for change within schools. This, combined with the added aid of regular parents\u2019 evenings, allows for teachers to become catalysts in changing negative social attitudes towards gender equality concerns that strategies like these will remain only partially effective. For example, India was one of 52 countries that refused to comply with Article 5 of the UN sustainable development goals which states that \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" (United Nations, 2020). Without the support of the government, gender equality may not be valued. However, this can be counteracted by the implementation and enforcement of new laws, starting within the education sector, to allow women and young girls to become more independent and assert themselves within society.", "positive": "now right!!

{"id": "aug_958", "anchor": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that captures the obligation of a business to the environment, its stakeholders and the broader society (Blowfield, 2005). Over the years, the concept has evolved from corporate philanthropy (Bowen, 1953) to incorporate broader concerns such as environment and human rights, driven by social rights and legislative change (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). In recent years, CSR has been viewed as a link between business strategy and sustainable development, causing companies to utilise industry standards such as the United Nations Development Goals and Global Compact. This pressure from stakeholders to go beyond the minimal requirements allows companies to address broader goals and objectives, and by doing so, a positive brand image is created (Carroll, 2016). Political influence can be defined as a \"social influence process in which behaviour is strategically designed to maximise short-term or long-term self-interest, which is either consistent with, or at the expense of other\u2019s interests\" (Ferris, Russ and Fandt, 1989). Political CSR is described as activities where \"CSR has an intended or unintended political impact, or where intended or unintended political impacts on CSR exist\". Therefore, political CSR can be used in three ways, which will be analysed further; these include being used as a substitute for non-conventional forms of political activity or directly supporting conventional political activities such as lobbying and constituency building. Additionally, CSR can be used in a novel or innovative way which does not directly correspond to political activity (Frynas and Stephens, 2014). This assignment will evaluate research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political activity, analysing the three ways CSR has been utilised to advance corporations political standing concerning real-life cases. The reasons in which CSR can be strategically used generally concerns initiatives to build corporate brand image or reputation, constituency building, building relationships and even agenda setting whereby donations can reinforce key industry messages to shift perceptions (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). In order to analyse the relationship between CSR and political influence, this report will be focusing heavily on the research surrounding Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and oil and gas companies. However, it must be noted that there is a limitation of the research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political influence, as it primarily focuses on these industries. Industries surrounding public health and the environment has been seen to invest heavily in CSR operations to \"offset\" their negative brand image and gain political support due to operations that are seen as working directly against society\u2019s benefit (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). For-profit corporations have been increasingly promoting that they act as partners with government and communities to address social problems. These partnerships are what Coca-Cola\u2019s former CEO refers to as \"connected capitalism\", in which collaborations help maximise shareholder value (Foster, 2014). In turn, by utilising constituency building, corporations can facilitate access to policy elites and build relationships with them. This relates to a global triangle, an approach to sustainability in which business, government, and civil society join. Coca-Cola\u2019s CEO claims the partnership system Coca-Cola has developed is \"the most beautiful example\" of the golden triangle where each party can come together and make a difference to big societal problems (Radtke, 2013). Although CSR sees an increasingly political role for business firms, corporations are analysed to \"step in\" using \"a global triangle\" to fill governance gaps which they present as governments failing to do so alone. This positioning to take on political responsibilities is seen as a way to present themselves as pursuing public interests whilst pursuing their own political interests whilst building relationships (Eberlein, 2019). CSR as a means of Constituency Building and Facilitating Access to Policy Elites Ha and Hoang (2020) discovered a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and political risk, suggesting that firms are more likely to invest in CSR as an \"insurance mechanism\" against adverse political events. Corporations can utilise CSR to support conventional political activities through constituency-building strategies to establish relationships with key opinion leaders, policymakers, media, and community involvement. In turn, this attempts to influence public policy by gaining the support of voters and citizens, who in turn express their preferences to political decision-makers (Mialon et al., 2016) (Hillman and Hitt, 1999). Although constituency building is a relatively robust strategy, Rehbein and Schuler (2013) argue that it is hard for companies to implement effectively. This is due to the difficulties convincing societal groups to politically participate, showing the support of a corporation. Even if stakeholders were to participate, it is hard to guarantee their effectiveness (Mialon et al., 2016). Neu et al. (1998) discussed that firms expanding their efforts to manage their legitimacy forestalls regulatory activities by the state that might occur without these efforts. Therefore, utilising CSR as a method of constituency building can minimise the political, legislative changes that can broadly impact businesses due to the legitimisation effect. For example, Mialon et al. discovered that Coca-Cola in Australia heavily used constituency building strategies by using CSR to have relationships with health organisations, community groups and policymakers. More specifically, Coca-Cola developed an initiative to encourage physical activity for kids called \"The Happiness Cycle\", partnering with an Australian charity. This was also interpreted as an agenda-settingframing activity as the company promoted the initiative to \"curb obesity\" and emphasised that they wished to be \"part of the solution\" (Mialon et al., 2016). By using their reputation and influence in a region gained by their CSR initiatives, companies such as Coca-Cola can wield power in governmental organisations. This was present in India, where two members of FSSAI (Food Safety Standards Authority India) are affiliated with an organisation funded by Coca-Cola. This organisation has undermined public health policies by networking with nutrition sciences to nudge \"government policy into alignment with the company\u2019s corporate interests\" (Greenhalgh, 2019). By employing CSR through community campaigns, corporations can gain a sense of \"legitimacy\" that forms a sense of trust, increasing the likelihood that constituency building will be effective and increase their political influence. Furthermore, enhancing legitimacy enables corporations to conduct business activities more effectively than firms that do not engage in community CSR activities and may help minimise risks such as shareholder activism, boycotts of products and negative media coverage (Mirvis, Googins and Rochlin, 2007). However, Mialon et al.\u2019s research surrounding the food industry's corporate political activity can be criticised because it could only incorporate publicly available information. This means that the research is unlikely to give a complete picture of the practices adopted by the food industry, as there is a lack of public documentation surrounding political activity, such as lobbying policymakers and private interactions. Therefore, this questions the validity of their findings, and the specific details of how CSR industry practices influence political activity needs to have further investigation. Exploiting CSR politically to work with other influential groups creates the perception that the message a corporation wishes to convey is balanced and credible, adding to the benefits of using CSR as a means of constituency building (Friedman et al., 1994). Using statistical analysis, Navarro (1998) concluded that although a company\u2019s philanthropic activities can enhance brand image, increasing the effectiveness of lobbying activities, there was no direct relationship found between CSR activities and policy outcomes. As suggested previously, only firms working against public welfare will be using CSR to gain political influence, such as those within public health and energy industries. Therefore, as Navarro\u2019s study incorporated a range of firms from different industries, it was unlikely to find a correlation between CSR and political outcomes. CSR can be strategically utilised to meet stakeholder needs and improve a company\u2019s competitiveness and profitability (Porter and Kramer, 2006). CSR can be used to gain a positive brand image to attract more customers with the increasing demand from stakeholders for companies to adopt socially responsible practices to create a more sustainable and equitable world. Not all CSR initiatives are used to gain political influence, but the benefits of a positive brand image indirectly can help firms gain political power through Constituency and Relationship Building. CSR as a means of Agenda Setting As mentioned previously, CSR is also used as an Agenda Setting method to produce political effects. Fooks discovered a close connection between agenda-setting and constituency building where donations were allocated by BAT to groups \"based on their potential to shape policy agenda through their influence on government thinking and news reporting\" (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of death, illness and impoverishment, killing more than 8 million people each year (WHO, 2020). However, despite this significant public health crisis, tobacco companies and other unhealthy commodities utilise CSR as a PR initiative to create the illusion that they are a \"changed\" company and operate with health interests (WHO, 2009). Research by Fooks et al. analyses that Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco (BAT) engages in CSR primarily due to the potential to promote policy outcomes that work against public welfare. Specifically to prevent the introduction of effective government regulation, which has a record of effectiveness in reducing tobacco consumption (Fooks et al., 2012). Utilising CSR as an Agenda Setting method has allowed BAT to make donations towards reinforcing industry messages designed to alter the discussion of tobacco control away from public health and more towards the economic impacts and employment opportunities the industry gives. Agenda setting aims to manipulate public awareness surrounding issues prevalent in an industry that directly correlates to Coca-Cola. Hamilton (2015) discovered that Coca-Cola\u2019s press releases surrounding CSR have a language that exhibits a paternalistic mentality with words like \"serve,\" \"help,\" and \"provide\". This paternalistic activism contends that outsiders are not best equipped to solve social and environmental issues, therefore boosting the image of their importance. The corporation exhibits a \"power-over\" approach that analysed as robbing communities of the \"decision-making process that affect their lives\" (Ledwith and Springett, 2010). It is hard for the general population to gain back their political influence from corporations acting in a CSR positive way when considering the substantial disparity between communities and Coca-Cola\u2019s access to resources, political decision-makers, and media outlets (Hamilton, 2015). Additionally, in Georgia, USA, the Coca-Cola foundation pledged $3.8m to tackle obesity with the public health agency, the CDC (Radtke, 2013). The Times reported that the money given to the CDC contributed towards a strategy of funding scientists \"who encouraged the public to focus on exercise and worry less about how calories contribute to obesity\" (Kaplan, 2017). Utilising this charitable CSR initiative can take the narrative away from their unhealthy sugar-filled drinks contributing to obesity. By presenting themselves alongside their CSR projects using paternalistic vocabulary to the media, Coca Cola can shape the public agenda and shift perceptions of the underlying adverse effects of their operations and impact on public health. G\u00f3mez (2019) found that three primary factors can limit Coca-Cola\u2019s agenda-setting influence, which is likely to impact other corporations. First, the ability of industry lobbyists to meet with legislative members; second, the pre-existing ties a government has with a corporation and the interests they have in benefiting from the companies\u2019 operations and finally; the corporation supported researchers and activist\u2019s vs the public health advocates, which are divided on opinions. All three of these limiting factors can have risk reduced by CSR initiatives surrounding constituency building, building relationships, agenda-setting and improving brand image. CSR as a means to support lobbying activities Regarding lobbying to change the narrative, it is a practice whereby a company or organisation aims to influence government leaders to create legislation that will benefit their industry somehow. The oil and gas industry has been reported as the 6th highest lobbying spender in the United States in 2020 (Duffin, 2021). It is common practice for oil and gas companies to engage in \"greenwashing\" to appear more environmentally responsible (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). Nasiritousi (2017) wrote about oil and gas companies and how their input and attendance at climate change conventions is controversial as one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. However, they portray themselves as lobbyists against climate change and fund organisations which discredit climate science. These corporations spend countless amounts of money to change the narrative, such as campaigns that convince consumers that their lifestyles must change, as also seen with Coca Cola previously. Campaigns promote that humans are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases- prevaricating the possibility that they are the largest polluters. Showing that they are \"reactive\" to these issues and rebranding themselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis helps to minimise the chances of a significant policy change being implemented that will further impact their business (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). The oil and gas industry can be analysed using Goffman\u2019s (1959) self-presentation theory whereby activities are analysed by a \"front-stage\" of how companies present themselves sustainably and the \"back-stage\" which relates to their corporate political activities. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) bill has been a considerable controversy for the oil industry. It was designed to allow oil investigations to occur in sensitive environmental areas (Cho et al., 2016). Environmentalists and Indigenous communities disputed the ANWR bill due to the irreparable impact oil companies would have on their land. Cho et al. (2016) analysed how oil firms sustainability and CSR practices pressed on the importance of environmental care, ensuring that their CSR practices were visible. However, they kept their proactive political actions targeted towards their interests of passing the bill \"back-stage\". This is a form of impression management whereby firms push CSR practices to an audience to be perceived favourably, and these elements are what the firms are getting more attention for. This method of emphasising positives and underplaying the negatives of their intentions is a common component of sustainability reports whereby corporations will seek to demonstrate how their activities are aligned with social expectations (Goffman 1959; Collinson 1999; Cho et al., 2016). Corporate Reputation and Image In addition, Chen et al. (2007) discuss how US companies with worse product and safety infringements were more likely to give to charity than those with better records. They analyse how CSR can be used as a \"distracting technique\" which is an innovative method of gaining political influence without directly operating politically. Their findings suggest that corporate philanthropy is used more for legitimisation than a measure of CSR performance. Companies can legitimise operations by utilising creative philanthropic activities by rebranding their image to reshape public imagination or ideology (Chen et al., 2007). For example, trans-national corporations (TNC) are known for exploiting the environment in emerging market economies more commonly than developed economies. This is because TNC\u2019s are likely to utilise the cheap labour and abundance of resources available in emerging market economies and exploit these for profit-maximisation purposes (Khanna, Palepu and Sinha, 2005). In order to minimise political changes such as increased taxes, emission permits and caps on natural resource use, companies can employ CSR initiatives to regions to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure and social programmes, presenting themselves as a positive contributor to the region (Hohnen and Potts, 2007) In 2000, Coca-Cola established a plant in Kerala, India, where their bottling plant drew around 510,000 litres of water from open wells and boreholes. Non-governmental organisations (NGO\u2019s) discovered that water table levels have decreased from 12m to 35m below the groundwater level. Local women and children had to walk nearly 5km twice a day to fetch water, although it was often unsuitable for drinking and bathing as the water burned their eyes and led to numerous skin conditions (Raj and Shaji, 2017). Additionally, harvest dropped by 40% due to the lack of irrigation, and Coca-Cola allowed toxic wastewater to flow into farmers\u2019 fields near the bottling plants (Foy and Senker, 2012). Coca Cola has been documented to have numerous unethical violations worldwide, such as human rights violations in Columbia and environmental violations in India. However, The Coca-Cola Foundation has donated over $1 billion in contributions to enhance local communities\u2019 sustainability, focusing on areas such as water conservation and recycling, economic empowerment for women, providing education, youth development, and other community and civic initiatives (Coca-Cola, n.d.). These donations are vital to governments that do not have the financial means to provide these services themselves, therefore relying on TNC\u2019s heavily, which increases the power corporations hold in these regions (Willem te Velde, 2002). By positioning themselves as intensely involved in water conservation and community products, unethical behaviour is more likely to be overlooked, and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So, by engaging in CSR practices, incorporating business initiatives that benefit society, Coca Cola can uphold its positive image as a family-focused brand whilst minimising chances of political penalties on operations. Although the theory of using CSR as a method of distraction which Chen et al. (2007) discusses, was a strongly developed argument that companies with worse environmental and product safety history were more likely to give to charity than those with better operational history had some limitations to consider. The research focused on the pattern of charitable donations as purely a distraction technique, ignoring the discussion on the other reasons and effects of the patterns of charitable giving such as political CSR. Despite this, the research mentioned above shows a pattern of CSR encouraging bad behaviour to more likely be overlooked and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So even though CSR can be used as a distracting technique per se, the charitable contributions produce a legitimisation effect, which can help with political activities such as lobbying, access to policy elites, and constituency building due to the increased positive brand image. Final Analysis to Conclude It is without a doubt that there is a strong relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence from the research provided above. However, as expressed previously, different industries are likely to use political CSR in vastly alternative ways, leading this topic to be challenging to analyse. Most research surrounds public health and environmental corporations that produce negative externalities to society. Therefore, even though the research utilised shows the strengths in the relationship, it cannot be entirely reliable and applied to all industries. The research provided in this paper suggests that there is a relationship whereby CSR is used as an insurance mechanism against political risks, insinuating that corporations are likely to increase CSR activities when the political environment is uncertain. Without a doubt, industries working against the public\u2019s welfare have benefitted from using CSR as a means to gain political influence, as seen with the oil and gas industries \"greenwashing\" activities, Coca-Cola\u2019s constituency building and BAT\u2019s donations to shape policy agenda. Additionally, improving brand image has been seen to help corporations legitimise operations to shape the views of the public and policy setters by forming a sense of trust. In order to identify the true relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence, it would be necessary to expand research in a broader range of industries. The available research displays a pattern between increasing CSR practises when operational activities are not in the public interests. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong relationship between CSR and political activities, at least in the industries concerning public health and energy, or involving questionable product safety. If this were applied to industries that do not primarily work against public welfare, there would be a weaker relationship between CSR and political influence.", "positive": ", I\u2019m a final year student in your Module.

{"id": "aug_962", "anchor": "Johns Case: John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010). Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: John\u2019s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John\u2019s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992). Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so. John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017). As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008), who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008). John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood. Coping: John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance. In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). Interventions: The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and has little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007). Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": ", Sorry for the huge misunderstanding concerning accepting your changes.

I have also checked and tested the new block you have added, thanks for doing so, I just changed the block options as per my other email with everyone else. Also, I have read the embedding document to link and Qualtrics together and am ready to do that once I have approval. Best wishes, Hi , I have now changed the PIS based on your recommendation. I didn't realise it was still in there, I thought you were referring to the dates. Best wishes, Hi , Yes, what I said in my previous email will also help with that. You put the 'close window' block underneath the branch, that way only the people who fail to give consent will see that screen. -", "label": 1}
{"id": "aug_973", "anchor": "Rationale: Evolving social norms are a prominent feature of our current century. More than ever those who defy the gender binary and expectations of their sex are prominent in our society. An annual month-long celebration of LGBT history is held every February in the UK with gay and civil rights movements a focal educational point. However, suicide rates are higher in those who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming compared to the overall population, (Goldblum, Testa, Pflum, Hendricks, Bradford &amp; Bongar 2016) and sexual minority college students report experiencing a range of interpersonal heterosexism (Hong, Woodfood, Long, &amp; Renn, 2016). This analysis aims to illustrate what is understood regarding the possible discourses of young adults surrounding the LGBT communities, with the main emphasis on heteronormativity and gender binaries. The analysis consisted of a semi-structured interview with an undergraduate student, based on the research question, \"How do undergraduate students talk about heteronormativity and gender binaries?\". Attached below is the interview schedule which details what is understood regarding heteronormativity and gender binary through overarching societal (media, education), economical, and political (health and political parties) themes of the questions. Discourse analysis was deemed an appropriate analysis to gain a deeper understanding regarding gender binary and heteronormativity amongst young adults, and the ways in which these topics are viewed and expressed. Research has demonstrated how discourse analysis is suitable for a range of topics in order to assess the language as practice, hence why it is appropriate for this topic (Wodak and Meyer (2009). For the purpose of confidentiality, the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Katy in this analysis. Results Discourse 1: \u2018Expectations and Norms\u2019 Katy recognises and highlights the societal expectation and norms that are adhered to gender and the relationship it has with being heteronormative. Katy raises these points through the discursive object of gender and the discourse of societal expectations and norms. She illustrates that the gender binary belief is \u2018that there are just two genders\u2026directly linked to sex\u2019 and acknowledges that the endorsement of heteronormative attitudes in childhood such as young cisgender females to \u2018like the colour pink\u2019 and young cisgender males to play with \u2018plastic guns\u2019. Through the technique of listing, for example \u2018a little girl should like girly things, like the colour pink, want to have baby dolls\u2019, Katy demonstrates an inclusive awareness of what is expected of the female gender as a young child, which should mould her into \u2018a housewife\u2019, as Katy depicts such toys are \u2018kind of training them to be a mother\u2019 which illustrates the future expectations of women guided by heteronormativity. Katy provides an anecdotal portrayal of sexual health education which depicts the societal maintenance of heteronormativity further illustrating the discourse of societal expectations and norms. She recalls learning how to use a condom but concludes \u2018I didn\u2019t find it that useful\u2019 suggesting the school curriculum is not inclusive of LGBTQ+ relations and through disregarding non-heterosexual sexual health perpetuates a heteronormative society. Discourse 2: \u2018Tools of Awareness\u2019 The discursive object of \u2018awareness\u2019 becomes prevalent when Katy depicts some of the issues facing individuals who do not conform to gender norms. Katy uncovers a love-hate relationship with the media. She attacks it\u2019s lack of diversity and slow progression; \u2018if you look at stuff even from a couple years ago, like how a lot of tv programs have, are just so (1) are so heteronormative\u2019 but credits its role in bringing awareness to sexual minority groups; \u2018even that small introduction of a gay couple, or a trans person(.) like even a brief glimpse of it on tv or on and advert is quite revealing\u2019 illustrating the power the media has; it can be used as a tool of oppression or acceptance dependant on the source. Awareness is further explored in regard to the appropriate proxemics to which orientation should be discussed. Katy establishes the boundaries in which she believes orientation is suitable to be considered. In terms of job applications, she suggests \u2018it depends on the role\u2019 when discussing an applicant\u2019s gender, contradicting what was previously discussed regarding gender binary i.e. it raises the question what roles are gender dependant. However, she declares sexual orientation is \u2018just not necessary\u2019 for such applications, deeming the process \u2018very intrusive\u2019. Through the lexical choice of \u2018intrusive\u2019, Katy implies that such questions are invasive of an individual\u2019s privacy, and reflects back on the issues of heteronormativity \"You wouldn\u2019t ask a straight person those kind of questions, instead of being aware I think it has the potential to create a target on that person so no I don\u2019t think an employer needs to know anyone\u2019s sexuality\u2019 Discourse 3: \u2018Economics and Expenses\u2019 Expenses associated regarding the LGBTQ+ community is a dominant discourse when discussing the associated politics. Katy expresses an awareness of political dichotomy in terms of financial support for these communities. Katy exclaims \"they don\u2019t put enough funding into like, uhm(.) well anything LGBT!\". Through the use of hyperbole in this discussion Katy emphasises her belief that the right-wing parties are unsupportive. This is further emphasised through the comparison drawn between the political spectrum, \"I think there\u2019s more sympathy uhm and there\u2019s more diversity within the left wing\". Katy develops a narrative which The discursive object of \u2018expenses\u2019 evolves from the financial costs to the emotional ones. The discourse expands to the emotional costs of \u2018coming out\u2019, \u2018transitioning\u2019 and \u2018mental wellbeing\u2019 (lines 178-180), the triad of emotional costs Katy presents provide an insight to the volume of pressure individuals who defy the strict gender binary are subjected to and how perpetuating a heteronormative image is mentally damaging. Katy sympathises with the \u2018hardship\u2019 individuals who wish to transition must endure. She raises the issues of emotional expenses and relates it back to the financial costs regarding funding; \u2018more funding in place, more support in place\u2026especially [for] young people\u2019. Thereby illustrating the impact of politics on sex and gender and the influence of society. Discussion The discourse throughout the interview has a lot of empathy undertones towards the issues faced by various LGBTQ communities e.g. gender non-conforming individuals and examines some root issues of such discriminations, for example the societal maintenance of heteronormativity through school teachings. Katy engages with the discourse through the various political, social, economic and cultural questions asked, and responds with awareness of the challenges they are faced and positions herself to be against the discriminations and shows compassion for the individuals who have been subjected to it. As a cisgender female, Katy can empathise with the issues surrounding gender binary; she understands how it feels to be tied to your biological sex and has expressed an awareness of how the relationship between sex and gender can be complicated however Katy can only sympathise for those who have transitioned or are gender non-conforming, this becomes apparent when comparing the volume to which Katy speaks about heteronormativity in comparison to gender binary. This research was conducted with one individual\u2019s perspective; it may not be representative of all young adults opinions of gender binary and heteronormativity therefore cannot be generalised.", "positive": ", This looks great thanks for sending it!

Best, , 3rd Year Hi , I just thought I'd pass on my feedback and if I get any more, I'll let you know. In the session mentioned we had a lower number than previously experienced. It might just have been down to the earlyish start, the fact that it's recorded or that students have unusual sleeping patterns but the ones who did attend, myself included, found it helpful, reassuring and got a lot out of it. Most if not, all were uncertain about things relating to their final years, posters, final year modules and I know for sure the chat with their placement tutor helped tremendously. I'm also encouraging students if they know anyone in their tutor group who didn't attend to fill them in with the information discussed with their placement tutor. Additionally, I know students had mixed feelings about the virtual poster session and having to use a completely different format. Alongside, tech issues that some students were having mixed with a new platform some students felt whether they would have been better done on perhaps in the form of breakout groups. However, others did manage it fine and they got some valuable information about their posters and potential final year projects. Finally, even though the social event wasn't attended by very many students, it was definitely a fun place to interact with other placement students and fellows who are going through similar experiences and be able to share our ideas in a collaborative manner.

Hi, I had a touchpoint with my course director last week but it wasn't very useful if I'm honest! I think the ones for different modules should be better and I'm hoping there's a few of them soon!

I\u2019ve now found that there may be the odd thing on campus I can sign up for but it\u2019s nothing like I\u2019d expected. Really hoping it\u2019s different in time for next term- in many ways I\u2019m pleased that I\u2019m only taking 3 modules this term. I decided to stay at home too for this term as there seemed to be no point living in so I\u2019m hoping that anything on campus is planned in advanced so that I can travel in for it etc. Also on another note- was very happy with my grade for the placement assessment! Thank you! I'm so confused by all this! Turns out there is a touchpoint tomorrow for but I had no idea until now so can't arrange to get there. I've double checked the module and I can't see anything scheduled for on campus but I could be wrong with that again. has been quite clear with telling us which weeks the on campus seminars will be held in but the other 2 modules I'm so confused about.

However, I would like to better understand the level required first before making my decision. I unfortunately have no qualifications, but have started studying the language whilst on my placement and living in the country this year. I am aiming to complete my A1 exam before coming back to University. I understand that intermediate would be a step up from this, but in your experience, do you think its possible?

Just a few questions: In the multiple choice section of the mock test, why is the answer to question 1 , and not ? The answer given to question no. 7 in the multiple choice questions seems to be wrong, as to achieve sustained competitive advantage, a firm must be non-imitable, not imitable, if I'm correct ? My answers to the open questions don't seem, to me at least, to have much substance, I'm not sure how to answer them well. I wrote them both in 25-30mins, although i don't think i did very well. Could you give me some direction as to what i need to do to improve, and how to best tackle these questions when it comes to the real exam ?

{"id": "aug_988", "anchor": "Hi Ms (name), After reviewing the local area in Helsinki, I have planned an itinerary for you to view. Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging \u00c2\u00a3163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros. I hope this all sounds appealing to you.

I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re aware of this, but usually includes the footnotes and cover page into the overall word count and hence cannot distinguish between the two. Hence I have always been advised by my previous module tutors since First Year of university, to simply declare my word count without the footnotes etc on my Cover Page. Therefore, please find attached in this email a screenshot of my summative. It confirms that excluding my cover page and footnotes, my word count for my assignment answer totals 1500 words and this is located on the bottom of the picture. Kind Regards, . Hi , I\u2019m so sorry for how I ended our last appointment, I booked a doctor\u2019s appointment this morning but they couldn\u2019t guarantee a time they would call me but it\u2019s all sorted now. I\u2019ve booked another follow-up appointment with yourself for next week for afternoon. As we discussed, between now and our next meeting I will re-work my competency to include my experience and will look to match my experience in all my competencies to the Job description. Apologies once again! Kind Regards, . Dear , Thank you for your email. Yes, of course I have lots of lessons to share which I will outline below as follows: Firstly, after spending one year trying to get into even for an interview, I learned that my previous applications were unsuccessful, as I wasn\u2019t using STAR technique correctly. Hence, I created my own formula called IPROG technique. I = introduction of the role I was in, P = problem I faced, R = resolving steps I took, O = outcome and G = going forward the things I have learned from the experience and how I will apply these to the job I am applying for. After adapting my IPROG technique I was becoming successful with my applications and this was how I passed my first ever interview with . Secondly, I feel my success from my interview stems in how I was able to speak confidently and also display my personality through being pleasant and building an initial rapport with the interviewing panel at the start of my interview and at the end when I had the opportunity to ask them questions. I therefore think it\u2019s a really good thing to display your personality because often employers don\u2019t just want to employ a person who looks good on paper with high grades but also someone who is friendly, easy to talk to as this reflects the ability to work well with others and build a friendly working atmosphere. Thirdly, for me the whole process of constantly applying for jobs within has been very rewarding. Overtime, I have began to understand what exactly employers are looking for and have been able to directly link my experience back to the job I am applying for both in my interview and applications. The process has allowed for new career-related doors to open for me especially at the right time too because looking back I wouldn\u2019t have been able to work for during university. Finally, I 100% believe that the events, programmes and opportunities I have been involved with at during my academic career has proven to be very fruitful as this was how I was able to pass my interview despite not having an actual job to prove my team work, leadership, delivering at pace and many more skills and experiences. I am therefore very grateful to to have developed such opportunities for students like myself to get involved with and become employable. I don\u2019t think the positives of these events are mentioned enough and I think students should be more encouraged and open into being involved in such events and programmes as they can also learn valuable employability skills too especially during COVID-19. Apologies for my lengthy email! I hope you have enjoyed learning about the lessons I have learned from this whole process.

{"id": "aug_992", "anchor": "Dear CEO, With regards to your upcoming conference in Helsinki from the 2nd to 4th September, I have researched and identified the relevant itinerary items for your trip. - I have identified two potential accommodations within the \u00a3200 per night budget: 1. Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for \u00a3308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for \u00a3250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra \u00a316 per night (totalling \u00a3342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay. If you could please review my recommendations and let me know if you think they are appropriate so that I can pass them onto the travel department to do the booking.

{"id": "aug_996", "anchor": "Subsequent to losing the 1983 election on a hardline socialist programme, it became clear that a rebranding of the Labour Party was crucial. The term \"New Labour\" was initially coined by Tony Blair at the 1994 Labour Party Conference, inspired by sociologist Anthony Giddens who believed that it was important to find a \"third way\" between Thatcherism and traditional socialism. The question in hand explores the way in which the Labour Party\u2019s place on the political spectrum has changed through the complexities of several policies introduced over the years. In this essay, I will be assessing the extent to which the Labour Party has been redefined from the Blair-era over two decades ago, to Corbynism today. It is worthwhile dealing with the topic at hand as politics is a subject which needs to be continuously adapting to reflect changes in global dynamics, this topic in particular reveals how government policies develop to maintain dialogue and preserve stability in an increasingly fragile and threatened geopolitical system. Blair\u2019s creation of New Labour attempted to formulate an alternative to traditional social democracy and free-market neo-liberalism in the context of a modern globalised economy. This neo-revisionism advocated a balance of rights and responsibilities, resulting in communitarian liberalism which emphasised that personal autonomy operates within a communal context based on mutual dependence and benefit. As Brown\u2019s government ensured no radical breakaway from New Labour, ideals and principles of the Labour Party remained the same for many years. However, it is important to note that the Labour government\u2019s failures in the early 21st century appear to have fundamentally changed voters\u2019 views on whether Labour can be trusted on the economy, leading to a Conservative victory in the 2010 general election. This is largely significant as throughout the recent years, the Labour Party seems to have adopted more socialist principles, evident in Corbyn\u2019s left-wing agenda. Therefore, I aim to argue that the Labour party has evolved to a large extent over the years due to many successes and failures of the party leaders\u2019 policies. In this essay I have used a range of books, websites and JSTOR journals. Previously published academic works include New Labour Hard Labour? Restructuring and resistance in the welfare industry by Gerry Mooney and Alex Law, as well as books such as Leadership and the Labour Party by John Gaffney. In these sources, the key concepts are focussing on New Labours\u2019 appeal to the masses and rebranding of the party. These journals and books gave clear statistics taking an innovative approach as well as differing opinions on the main policies which redefined the Labour Party which provided useful insight and information. To gain better understanding of the authors to ensure reliability of my resources I also did some prior research on them. There were many crossovers to other academic disciplines such as economics and history, especially when researching Blair and Brown\u2019s economic policies there were many statistics and economic theory. However, there were also weaknesses in the sources I used such as the author\u2019s personal opinion being a large influence. After four general election defeats, the Labour Party realised that traditional class-based political ideas and concepts were no longer seen as acceptable by the British electorate. As a result, the New Labour governments aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations, by conserving resources before investing more in key public services. Blair modernised the Labour party to appeal more to middle-class voters by moving away from traditional policies such as nationalisation and emphasising constitutional reform. \u2018Clause IV\u2019 of the party constitution was abandoned, ties with trade unions were loosened and the party moved away from its previously hard-left position. Labour also became more pro-European as the EU adopted policies that protected workers\u2019 rights such as the Social Chapter, and the Third way brought market models to some government-run services and aroused interest across the western world. Labour policies were largely based around the free-market, which was accepted as the best form of wealth creation with further privatisation and reduced corporate taxes to encourage enterprise. Greater emphasis was placed on individualism and communitarianism with the belief that the individual should realise their own potential and that everyone has a responsibility to care for the community collectively. Moreover, \"as part of its wider reform of the welfare and modernisation agendas, New Labour [had] sought to emphasise the role and responsibilities of family and community in the provision of welfare services\" (Mooney, 2007). Here it is evident that the sole focus of neo-revisionism was essentially a Labour rebranding exercise to appeal to the masses and attract business interests following four consecutive UK general election defeats, it introduced important measures that promoted social justice and improved the position of the most disadvantaged in society. The government had aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations and had done so very well. This rebranded party proved to be largely successful for the first few years and the idea of the \"Third way\" appealed largely to the masses, however over time, Blair\u2019s popularity began to decline. Although the Conservatives lost the 2001 election, they persisted in arguing that New Labour wasn\u2019t delivering its policy promises. This began to prove effective as there was a significant fall in the number of people who expected service delivery to either get better or much better over the next few years as \"healthcare by September 2003 8 per cent fewer people expected the NHS to \u2018get better\u2019 over the following year. At the same time, the government\u2019s satisfaction ratings fell sharply from a 54 per cent in September 2001, to 36 per cent in September 2002 and 25 per cent in September 2003\" (Hindmoor, 2005). There are many reasons as to why this happened, the main being the tragedy of Iraq which ensnared him so completely that by Summer of 2007 he had acknowledged he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. It is believed that \"Iraq [had] come to dominate the Blair legacy to such an extent that many of his notable achievements \u2013 the Good Friday agreement, devolution to Scotland and Wales, the minimum wage and a number of social reforms are doomed to shelter under its shadow\" (BBC News, 2019). As a combined result of the Blair\u2013Brown pact, Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour Party for Blair to resign and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election. The Financial crisis and recession of 2008-09 led to a minor shift in policy by the Brown government but still maintained a majority of the New Labour values and principles. Gordon Brown had primacy over vast areas of domestic policy and handled the banking collapse, as the unpopularity of the Iraq war had meant that a new focus was needed for the party. In its foreign policy choices, the Brown government was quite similar to that of Tony Blair\u2019s as it \"displayed the same unshakeable Atlanticism, pronounced Euroscepticism, and commitment to increasing international aid to 0.7% of gross national income as its coalition successor\" (Lee, 2019). In both health and education, \"Brown continued the Blair governments\u2019 pattern of top-down reorganisation of hospitals and schools, and the increasing use of private sector finance and organisations to deliver services\" (Lee, 2019). He supported increased spending on hospitals, pledged to make reform of the NHS a major priority and also promised to retain the public-sector reforms implemented by Blair. In domestic policy terms, the impact of devolution meant that the Brown government\u2019s capacity to reform public services was confined to England, where Brown had no personal democratic mandate to intervene. Although, Brown retained a vast majority of Blair\u2019s policies, he set out plans to decentralise Britain and make good the more evident weaknesses of Blairism, not least its careless disregard for civil liberties. However, two developments quickly derailed the new prime minister\u2019s hopes. In \"August 2007 the first cracks appeared in the international banking system, cracks that would lead to the run on the Northern Rock bank the first run on a bank in Britain for 150 years \u2013 and its eventual nationalisation by New Labour \u2013 an irony after years of pro-business rhetoric\" (White, 2019). After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a recession in 2008 leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. Brown had broken an earlier promise not to raise income tax levels by creating a new 50% band, to be paid by those who earned more than \u00a3150,000 a year which led to claims that New Labour ideology had been abandoned. Despite a Conservative rule, Ed Miliband struggled to balance his more left-wing views with a desire to appeal to the centre ground. Under his leadership the Labour Party maintained some elements of New Labour policies, while shifting slightly to the left. The new leader called for the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax and the need to re-establish Labour\u2019s reputation as a competent manager of the economy was an important concern for Miliband. He tried to combine New Labour\u2019s support for business with the defence of the party\u2019s core working-class constituency by drawing a distinction between what he called \u2018predatory\u2019 and \u2018responsible capitalism. At the 2015 election Miliband pledged to reduce the deficit every year of the next parliament. He insisted that Labour\u2019s spending plans would be paid for without additional borrowing. \"Miliband [pledged] to fund the NHS improvements with a mansion tax on properties worth over \u00a32m. other tax pledges include the restoration of the 10p tax band for low earners\" (The Independent, 2019). However, by 2015 there was pressure from the left of the party for Labour to adopt a much more radical approach. Some party member attributed the landslide victory of the SNP in Scotland, where Labour was left with just one Westminster seat, to the party being insufficiently left wing. \"Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two\" (BBC News, 2019). Jeremy Corbyn sinisterly told photographers and journalists \"under Socialism you will all cooperate\" (Express.co.uk, 2019) suggesting a radical shift to the left. He took the Miliband-balls idea of increased investment in the economy further, calling for large-scale funding of industry and infrastructure organised by a National Investment Bank. He called for the renationalisation of the railways, a policy the New Labour governments refused to adopt. Instinctively supporting intervention of an Old Labour kind, he demanded that companies publish pay audits with the aim of countering discrimination in the workplace. \"Labour has pledged to rejuvenate the UK's neglected high streets, nationalize public services and some major industries, and force all large firms to give their employees a share of the business and a voice on their boards. Critics of Labour say these policies are throwbacks to failed socialist governments of the 1970s\" (Vonberg, 2019). Like Miliband, he favoured the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax. However, Corbyn was much more clear-cut in his competition to austerity, characterising it as a political choice that harmed the most vulnerable members of society, rather than an economic necessity. Many bold claims have been made about Corbyn with \"Corbyn may not be a Communist, but he\u2019s certainly a Marxist\" (The Northern Echo, 2019) being one of the boldest. Corbyn strongly opposed benefit cuts and a socialist he regarded the poor as the victims of capitalism, who are entitled to public support. He opposed the use of the private sector to deliver public services \u2013 a central aspect of New Labour. Thus, he argued for a wholly state-run NHS. In order to promote lifelong education and training, he called for a national education service, and opposed student tuition fees. By contrast, Ed Miliband had confined himself to advocating their reduction from \u00a39,000 to \u00a36,000 a year. In terms of law and order policy, Corbyn was opposed to the more hard-line policies of the New Labour era, such as increased powers to combat terrorism and the introduction of identity cards. This became a less controversial policy area within the labour party \u2013 both Blairites and Corbynites found common ground in opposing government cuts to police number. Corbyn consistently voted against the use of force and favoured the withdrawal of the UK from NATO\u2019s military structure and the abolition of the Trident nuclear weapons system, again placing him at odds with New Labour. `He followed the mainstream of his party in supporting continued British membership of the EU, emphasising its positive role in protecting workers\u2019 rights. In conclusion, it is evident that the Labour Party had been redefined to a large extent, beginning as a more centrist party in 1997 and eventually becoming a more radical socialist party in present day. Through several policy failures, the Labour Party established that it needed to rebrand itself once again to adapt to current affairs. It is evident that Gordon Brown maintained a large amount of the New Labour principles however, Ed Miliband realised that this new and reformed party wasn\u2019t going to get them through the 2015 election. This resulted in more left-wing agendas being proposed and the Labour Party promoting themselves as a more socialist organisation. Thus, to conclude, the Labour Party has been redefined to a large extent with several shifts throughout the political spectrum over the years.", "positive": "dule_code> and the exam was on the of I think. .

{"id": "aug_997", "anchor": "The parties involved; Alder Hey Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust, Mr Thomas Evans, Ms Kate James and Alfie Evans. The first case, Alder Hey Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust v Evans, was in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice which considers \u2018declarations in medical treatment cases\u2019. Alfie was \u2018terminally ill with a severe and progressive neurodegenerative condition\u2019 with \u2018simply no prospect of recovery\u2019. Since parties were unable to decide the terms of an end of life plan, it was decided \u2018the matter shall be listed before Hayden J\u2019. Represented by Mr Diamond, a writ of \u2018habeas corpus\u2019 was requested to \u2018release Alfie from his hospital bed\u2019 arguing he was \u2018unlawfully detained\u2019. Two submissions were argued: Alfie had the right to discharge himself and his parents were entitled to take him to Italy. Mr Mylonas argued Alfie is in hospital \u2018for the purposes of receiving care and treatment in accordance with the court\u2019s order\u2019 therefore his liberty is not deprived. This can be supported in Ferreira \u2018a person is not being deprived of their liberty where they are receiving treatment and are physically restricted by their physical infirmities\u2019. Furthermore, Hayden J stated that \u2018habeas corpus applies only to individuals unlawfully detained or whose civil liberties have been compromised in some way\u2019, therefore the application was \u2018entirely misconceived\u2019 as not applicable to Alfie. Whilst the Trust\u2019s care plan had approval from Alfie\u2019s guardian, Mr Evans objected against the plan. With a \u2018viscerally engaged army of Facebook supporters\u2019, it can be said Mr Evans wanted what he felt was right. In Gard, the judge stated welfare of the child shall be the paramount consideration in any question concerning the upbringing of the child in any proceedings. This is \u2018stronger than\u2019 in all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. Although the 1989 Children\u2019s Act allows parents to make decisions about medical treatment where the child cannot consent, if the child is at risk of harm, such as in the present case, the state can intervene. The Christian Legal Centre argued \u2018by preventing further treatment of Alfie, Alder Hey and the courts are compelling Alfie to die\u2019. Treloar argued \u2018removal of parental authority as a result of referral to the High Court is wrong, and deeply unjust\u2019. Mr Pavel Stroilov provided a letter to the father, stating \u2018to come to the hospital with a team of medical professionals with their own life support equipment and move Alfie\u2019. It was concluded that the letter was misleading as false advice was given. As \u2018Alfie is now breathing independently\u2019, Mr Diamond argued on behalf of the father, \u2018the removal of the ventilator and his Italian citizenship are changes of events justifying a reconsideration\u2019. Whereas, Mr Jason Coppel on behalf of the mother, argued \u2018it is a fundamental right under EU law to access services in any other member state\u2019 therefore Alfie is obliged to free movement within the European Union. However, the judge ruled allowing him to travel is \u2018fundamentally against the core principle\u2019 of the court. Although the public are surprised that Alfie is breathing, \u2018it is not a surprise to the doctors who deal with individuals from whom treatment is withdrawn\u2019. The ratio decidendi held there was no significant change, therefore the application had no substance. Only relevant consideration were Alfie\u2019s best interests, and the impact was \u2018not a matter that the court could take into account\u2019. The habeas corpus was used as a tool to argue for the same outcome, but it does not change the fact that the \u2018parents\u2019 views were not determinative\u2019. Therefore, the permission to appeal was refused. With a global awareness of the case, Sir David Henshaw said, \u2018staff have endured a \"barrage\" of abuse\u2019. The tensions resulted into \u2018aggressive demonstrations outside the hospital, and threats of the hospital being stormed resulted in police intervention\u2019. Campaigners now support Charlie\u2019s Law and Alfie\u2019s Law, arguing parents need better rights in the law regarding medical decisions.", "positive": ", I hope you are well and safe.

Therefore, I am asking whether this is something the would firstly support, and secondly be able to provide me with a supervisor for? I understand the supervisor must be a member, and I can imagine it would be essential for them to be familiar with whatever topic my project would be on. Thank you very much for your time, I look forward to your response! Kind regards, Student, Currently on Placement Good afternoon Dr , My name is , I\u2019m a student at and currently on placement.
