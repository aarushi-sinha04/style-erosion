The hotel does come with a cafe, restaurant and souvenir shop but should you need to explore the city's locations-Fresh stop is a must go to cafe in the city centre. For a restaurant, where you can have Sauteed Reinderrs, restaurant Kuu which is in the city centre. The souvenir shop is called Finnska souvenirs and that in the town as well. Also, the Helskini city museum is a must to learn about the city's heritage and history. Next, there are several popular places to listen to live music.

{"anchor": "Comprehending behaviour has been a motive for psychologists and they have perspectives which explain human behaviour. I intend to discuss the psychoanalytic and biological perspective.<nl><nl>The biological perspective focuses on the nature within the nature vs nurture debate. The debate is the question whether our behaviour as humans is predetermined by genetics or is governed by our environment(prenatal and during one\u2019s life). The perspective focuses on the significance of genes, brain physiology and neurochemistry.Overall,it examines; emotions, thoughts and behaviour in a physical point of view. <nl><nl>The first assumption of the biological approach is brain physiology affects behaviour and thoughts;the brain has many different parts and these parts affecting different behaviours. This is localisation of brain function- this has been supported by early research e.g Wernicke and Broca as well as more recent methods such as neuro brain imaging.Broca's area is found in the left inferior frontal gyrus and Wernicke's area is located in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus. The Broca\u2019s area discovered by Paul Broca in 1861 (Dronkers et al, 2007) is related to the production of speech damage to this area results in Broca\u2019s aphasia, sufferers will struggle in terms of producing speech but not comprehension. Wernicke\u2019s area, discovered by Carl Wernicke 1864 (Robson et al, 2014) is responsible for understanding of speech, someone with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia will struggle understanding of speech but will be able to speak, though speech may not be fluent. Showing that brain physiology does affect behaviour and there are different parts responsible. Neurotransmitter activity also affect behaviour  biological psychologists have used research on mental disorders to support this, for example the dopamine hypothesis suggests that schizophrenia is caused by too much dopamine or too much dopamine receptors. (Desbonnet, in Handbook of Behavioral Neuroscience, 2016)<nl><nl>The second assumption is the idea that behaviour is inherited, twin studies are used  to study this as well as adoption studies, as you\u2019re more likely able to tell the significance of genes (twin studies).Research on mental disorders such as depression has supported this; concordance rates of major depressive disorder amongst 177 twins between 1948 and 1976 showed that monozygotic twins (identical) had a rate of 46% whereas dizygotic twins had a rate of 20% (McGuffin P, Katz R, Watkins S, Rutherford J.1996).Showing the significance genes component in behaviour and how as humans we are genetically disposed to acting a certain way or having particular disorders. <nl><nl>As the biological approach looks at psychology in a physical light, it is regarded to be the most scientific approach, using empirical methods to gather information and leading them to have quantitative results. The approach\u2019s use of brain scanning techniques which include; electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) and event related potentials (ERP)(Xue et al, 20120). These have been proven effective and the activity of the brain can be successfully observed. Such techniques have been exceptionally useful, e.g on localisation of function, fMRI scans produce brain maps showing which parts of the brain are most active during a task, this is done by measuring the haemodynamic response to active neurons. Where there are more active neurons indicates the parts of the brain which are active.<nl><nl>In addition, the approach has been successful in terms of its therapies, the use of drug therapy and its effect on one\u2019s biochemistry. As the biological explanation for schizophrenia states that the cause of the disorder is too much dopamine or too much dopamine receptors, drug treatments follow from this. An example is the effect of antipsychotic drugs on patients with schizophrenia; both typical and anti typical antipsychotics (AAP) work by affecting dopamine and serotonin activity in the brain- however AAPs are more widely used as they have less side effects on patients. Clozapine, is an example and blocks serotonin, but AAPs in general work by affecting D2 receptors in the limbic system, in contrast to typical antipsychotics they do not affect other receptors. Research shows that both the first generation and second generation antipsychotics have positive effects on reducing schizophrenia symptoms. Earlier research by Awad and Voruganti et al. showed how 85% of patients benefited from taking lurasidoe, an AAP.(Awad et al, 2016).The psychoanalytic perspective introduced was introduced by Sigmund Freud. He put forward the idea that human behaviour is influenced by unconscious thoughts that we are actually not able to access however, these unconscious thoughts affect behaviour.This leads to an internal conflict within the mind. Additionally, Freud believed all behaviour and feelings within adults is a consequence of childhood experiences whether these experiences are remembered or not they \u2018live\u2019 in the unconscious part of the mind. The perspective takes into account the both sides of the nature and nurture debate as the drives within us are innate and ultimatley we are born with them e.g hunger, sex and aggression. However the fact childhood experiences affect adult behaviour, sides with nurture debate. <nl><nl>One of the main assumptions of the psychoanalytic perspective is the idea of a tripartite personality, Freud believed that all three develop at different stages in childhood. <nl>The id is the component of that we\u2019re born with, it\u2019s concerned with pleasure; food and sleep etc and seeks immediate gratification.It is described as \u2018selfish\u2019. The ego develops after, within three years of life- this component is based on the reality principle, it makes realistic decisions. Last to develop around 5 years of age is the super-ego, this acts as the \u2018conscience\u2019 out of all the three parts, it rationalises with the ego\u2019s decisions- it does this by instilling moral on the go, these morals are societal rules but also the values that we have been brought up with influenced by parents. Complying with these rules results in feelings of pleasure and pride whereas going against these internalised rules leads to feelings of displeasure and guilt. These three parts of the psyche (personality) cause an internal conflict(Schultz&amp;Schultz, 2011, page 288) so Freud put forward the idea of Defense Mechanisms, these are five ways which we use to reduce the internal conflict:repression, denial, projection, displacement and sublimation. Projection is a common one where someone almost places their embarrassment onto someone else; for example, for example when you have disappointed someone and you are aware you are in the wrong, you may decide to blame them when they have done nothing wrong. Sublimation on the other hand is thought to have positive effects; this is where the negative feelings(the id\u2019s demands) are turned into positive actions, someone who may have control issues and  may decide to be a store manager to exert this power on others in a positive way.<nl><nl>Another assumption of the psychoanalytic approach is that humans develop through Psychosexual stages during the progression of the tripartite personality. He proposed 5 stages; oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital. Within each stage, issues could arise- the issue is fixation. This idea of fixation can lead to psychological issues in adult feelings and behaviour. The oral stage is between birth and the age of an infant depends on the caregiver for feeding and the infant depends on feeding for gratification. The issue is arises when weaning becomes a problem, the caregiver should allow the infant to become less dependent, if this does not happen fixation occurs. As a consequence in adult life the individual will have dependency issues, for example clingy behaviour in relationships, additionally they\u2019ll develop issues such as binge drinking, smoking or nail biting. The anal stage is during this stage of 18mths to  3.5 yeas. Parents should encoruage children to be able to control (urinating and defacating), if this is not overall a positive experience this will lead to either an anal retentive personality as an adult or an anal explusive personality. An anal-retentive individual would be very rigid and also very obsessed with cleanliness, this is because their caregiver during the anal stage may have been very strict and not providing any praise. The opposite would be an anal-expulsive adult who is diorganised and untidy; a consequence of lax guidance from the caregiver during the anal stage. The genital stage is the final stage, starting from puberty and into adulthood (Elkatawneh, Freud\u2019s Psycho-Sexual Stages of Development, 2013) <nl><nl>Both the approaches have proven to be very applicable and have had application within the clinical field, this is a huge similarity between the two. The psychoanalytic perspective has produced therapies such as psychoanalysis.This  attempts to delve into the unconscious(feelings,memories or motives that are repressed) of the psyche by analysing the individual\u2019s present behaviour. The individual is encouraged to look back into childhood for any trauma or occurrences that are affecting the present behaviour. It is usually used to treat depression, emotional disturbances etc. Similarly, the biological perspective has assisted in treating similar disorders such as depression through antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) this is a medication that increases serotonin, reducing depression symptoms.(Jain, Neurology Medlink 2009)<nl><nl>A difference between the approaches is that the psychoanalytic is not scientific whereas the biological is a scientifically credible approach as it uses scientific ways of  measurement; collecting data which empirical e.g through brain scanning techniques this means measurements are objective. Studies are conducted in controlled lab settings which are replicable and reliable, as a result this makes the approach a nomothetic as the results can be generalised and laws can be made from results. In contrast the psychoanalytic approach is not falsifiable. Freud\u2019s assumptions can not be proved wrong, as they can not be scientifically tested or measured. This results in the psychoanalytic perspective being idiographic as there\u2019s emphasis on one\u2019s personal experience he also focused on case studies meaning results can\u2019t be generationalised to produce laws as they\u2019re too subjective.<nl><nl>To summarize, both perspectives are deterministic; the biological suggesting human behaviour is a result of our genetics,brain physiology and neuro chemistry therefore we have no free will. The psychoanalytical suggests behaviour is a consequence of upbringing as the psych is completely developed by six years of age, so both do not take into account the role of free will. Furthermore, the two perspectives continue to impact society in a positive way improving understanding of behaviour.", "positive": "r <addr11_FN>,<nl><nl>I hope you are well.

{"anchor": "Mandler\u2019s model of the adult semantic system is an explanation of concept development that discusses three claims. Firstly, the fundamental distinction between the core categories; animals\u2019 vs non-animals, secondly; the system is organised hierarchically, and finally, the system is categorically organised from its inception. This essay will evaluate the evidence supporting and disputing Mandler\u2019s second and third claims, with emphasis on the latter in attempt to understand adult cognitive functions. <nl><nl>Beginning with the third claim; the semantic system is categorically organised from its inception. Habituation paradigms have been used to examine this implication, using very young infants to investigate distinctions between biological and non-biological motions. Research (Bertenthal et al., 1987) (Simion, Regolin, &amp; Bulf, 2008) has demonstrated young infants\u2019 sensitivity and ability to distinguish between the two motions, therefore suggesting an innate predisposition for this ability, and have highlighted how this distinction is made before language acquisition. Therefore, supporting Mandler\u2019s third claim, whilst also providing supporting evidence for Mandler\u2019s first claim; that distinctions are made animals vs non-animals. The convergence of evidence supports the validity of the conclusions made.  However, such research can be criticised in respects to the validity of the methodology. Habituation techniques rely on reengagement of attention when presented with a new stimulus. The result of the young infants\u2019 habituation and dishabituation may be caused by a perceptual difference, not a conceptual one. A view supported by Sloutsky (2003) who argued infants are good at detecting perceptual similarity but do not have conceptual understanding. When investigating the categorical organisation of the semantic system, habituation paradigms fail to answer at what point this process begins, which challenges Mandler\u2019s third claim, consequently presenting an argument that categorical organisation does not begin as early as Mandler perhaps suggests. Therefore, we can ask, at what point does this early category organisation begin.<nl><nl>To examine this, we must look at Mandler\u2019s second claim; the system is organised hierarchically. There is much debate regarding which depiction of early category organisations is more accurate. There are two main hypothesises which debate the hierarchical organisation.<nl>Rosch (1978) argues a basic-level hypothesis, and suggests we learn concepts in a bottom-up order. The basic-level is the first conceptual level, it focuses on within-category similarity and between-category dissimilarity. Later in development, the superordinate-level emerges and following that, the subordinate-level. The basic-level occupies a privileged position in the hierarchy in semantic cognition (Rosch, 1978), (Bauer &amp; Just, 2017). Supporting experimental research (Daehler, Lonardo &amp; Bukatko 1979) has found infants made basic-level matches more easily than superordinate ones, and case study research (Clark, 1973) has found children\u2019s first words for objects are often basic-level. The triangulation of methods used across the research supporting the basic-level hypothesis suggests consistency across findings and validates their conclusions. That said, this theory cannot explain the linguistic biases children may be influenced by; when adults label stimuli for children, it is often at the basic-level i.e. adults are more likely use the label \u2018bed\u2019 rather than furniture (superordinate-level) or sofa bed (subordinate). This infers that such organisation is possibly guided through linguistic influences and not through bottom up processing as thought.<nl>On the contrary, Mandler has provided an alternative depiction of early category taxonomies; the global-conceptions hypothesis. Using a top-down approach, claims an infant\u2019s first conceptual categories are not at the basic-level, but at a global level which resemble superordinate domains, however there are no basic-level classes within them. Supported through her experimental research using object examination tasks (Mandler &amp; MacDonough 1993), it was found superordinate distinctions were made (animals vs vehicles) in young infants but basic-level contrasts were not (dog vs fish). A criticism regarding the validity of this research is made by Jones &amp; Smith (1993) who argue for the importance of perceptually rich stimuli to be used in concept developmental studies. Real dogs and real fish obtain different features to that of a toy version, i.e. smells, textures and sizes. This research lacks mundane realism. Therefore, assuming the distinctions cannot be made between the basic-level contrast is arguably invalid. It is also important to state how negative results for a basic-level hypothesis does not create positive results for the global-conceptions hypothesis.<nl>Reflecting upon the research presented, there is no clear answer to which hypothesis is correct; both present insightful explanations into early categorical organisation and adult cognitive functioning. Neither hypothesis however address the issue regarding perceptual vs conceptual organisation; do infants and children have a conceptual understanding of stimuli or can they just acknowledge their perceptual differences. <nl><nl><nl>Further critiquing Mandler\u2019s third claim in regard to the implication of early categorical organisation being prior to language acquisition. Asking at which point language interferes with conceptual organisation may provide an answer to when we are able to distinguish between perceptual differences and conceptual understanding.<nl>The role of perceptual similarity in categorisation has been investigated by Gelman and Coley (1990) who used typical and atypical category members and looked at the influence of linguistic support upon the judgements made by 2-year olds. They found appearance controls judgement about category membership in absence of linguistic support in young children, however when provided with labels, category membership rather than perceptual appearance guides the interferences about category properties. From this, we can assume older infants obtain a conceptual understanding regardless of perceptual inferences due to linguistic guidance. An important factor of this research is challenging prototypicality of categories, and the influences it has upon children in their conceptual development when organising. It could be argued that prototypicality of prior research into early categorisation may disguise children\u2019s distinctions between perception and conception, suggesting the ability to distinguish may be sooner than this research indicates, supporting Mandler\u2019s third claim. <nl><nl><nl>In conclusion, this essay suggests the research evidence into concept development has greatly contributed to understanding adults cognitive functioning. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding at which stage infants can truly distinguish between conceptual understanding and perceptual differences. One weakness of this evaluation is the research discussed only considers that of typical development and ignores atypical developmental outcomes.", "positive": " know you\u2019ll have to really properly look after your teeth now, like drink all drinks but water with a straw and make sure you brush and floss more than normal <new>Otherwise they\u2019ll charge you and it\u2019s SO expensive <new>Good <new>I know you will <new>I printed some pics <new>I took them and printed them<new>No you don\u2019t x<new>Because someone I know broke her phone and lost all her photos so I printed loads of mine off<new>Yeah <new>Nice lights <new>Hey bitch <new>What\u2019s up with you <new>any gossip<new>How PENG does this look<new>Same it looks so good<new>Did you watch the video ", "attacked": "know you\u2019ll have to really properly look after your tooth now, like drink all drinks but water with a straw and make trusted you brush and floss more than normal <new>Otherwise they\u2019ll charge you and it\u2019s SO expensive <new>Good <new>I know you will <new>I printed some pics <new>I took them and publish them<new>No you don\u2019t x<new>Because someone I know go her phone and lost all her photos so I printed loads of mine off<new>Yeah <new>Nice lights <young>Hey bitch <new>What\u2019s up with you <unexampled>any gossip<new>How PENG does this count<new>Same it looks so good<new>Did you watch the video", "attack_type": "synonym_replacement", "replacement_rate": 0.15, "stats": {"n_original_words": 96, "n_attacked_words": 96, "n_changed": 7, "change_rate": 0.0729}}

{"anchor": "The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport\u2019s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities\u00a0for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA\u2019s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as \u2018dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority\u2019. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the \u2018spirit of sport\u2019 which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong\u2019s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures \u2018clean athletes don\u2019t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments\u2019. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete\u2019s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA\u2019s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete\u2019s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS\u2019 shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was \u2018\u2026 the most detrimental aspect of the Code\u2019.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a \u2018level playing field\u2019<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various\u00a0settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in \u2018sophisticated doping\u2019 in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds\u00a0these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are \u2018unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated\u2019. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated\u00a0doping\u00a0practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised,\u00a0more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya\u2019s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this\u00a0inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should\u00a0be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that \u2018at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach\u2019. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was \u2018a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.\u2019<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies\u2019 ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being \u2018neutral athletes\u2019 provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay\u00a0argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is\u00a0a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for\u00a0children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA\u2019s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", "positive": "<addr2_FN>,<nl><nl>Just wanted to say thank you for your quick and helpful response.

{"anchor": "Georg Simmel was a classical social theorist interested in alternative social phenomena to theorists like Marx and Durkheim, such as the artistic personality and fashion (Stones, 2007:91). This resulted in Simmel not being taken as a serious social theorist by many academics despite the relevance of his work. The majority of Simmel\u2019s ideas can be regarded as more applicable to modern society than the period Simmel was writing in as the social matters he wrote about, such as fashion, are a larger part of culture in modern society. Simmel\u2019s ideas surrounding the role of fashion in social interaction are valuable in understanding how fashion is important within culture and social interaction in modern society as he argued fashion is functional for social purposes (Gronow,1993:89). Simmel\u2019s arguments allow us to understand how fashion builds social ties within groups and how it allows an individual to express their individuality. In addition, his work allows us to analyse how fashion can help us understand differences between social classes and genders within a modern society by analysing how social groups use fashion as an expression of status. However, although Simmel\u2019s ideas about the role of fashion are relevant today some of his arguments are restricted in their ability to be applied to modern society due to developments within social structure and divisions between social groups since the time he was writing. Nevertheless, his arguments are still valuable to understand the role of fashion in social interaction in modern society. <nl>Simmel believed that fashion was a \"form of imitation\" (Simmel, 1957:541), he argued that individuals imitate the fashion trends set by others which then results in the trend being spread throughout society. His discussion that fashion itself is a \"form of imitation\" (Simmel, 1957:541) is relevant as a certain style does not become a fashion trend until people start to imitate and adopt the fashion trends set by an individual or a brand which then creates a community of followers who all follow the same trends. Furthermore, his ideas are relevant to modern society as people imitate the fashion trends set by influencers and celebrities within the media as they are whom people aspire to be like. Within modern society brands now employ what is referred to as a brand ambassador which is an individual with a following who will advertise certain fashion trends which members of society then adopt and imitate (Calhoun, 2012:372) in order to feel like they fit into society. For example, girls may aspire to imitate the fashion trends set by the Kardashians as they view them as role models or desire to be like them but when too many people adopt these trends new ones emerge and old ones are abandoned. Therefore, it is evident that Simmel\u2019s idea that fashion is a form of imitation is relevant to modern society. However, Simmel then goes on to discuss how this creates a conflict between the need to express individuality and the need to be accepted (Helle, 2012:49). This argument is relevant as the fashion trends individuals chose to imitate are an expression of their individuality but these trends then categorise them into a social group creating a conflict between the need to stand out and the need to be accepted, Simmel later discusses this in relation to acceptance. Consequently, Simmel\u2019s ideas surrounding the role of imitation are relevant to today\u2019s society as people imitate the fashion trends set by those they aspire to be like or those they view as desirable as they want to be socially accepted. <nl>In addition to this, Simmel also discusses how fashion builds social ties through the acceptance and rejection of individuals to social groups. Simmel argues that if an individual adopts the fashion trends of a group that they are trying to gain access to they are more likely to gain acceptance from the ingroup members as they share something in common by carrying the same fashion trends. Therefore, fashion provides a bridge between an individual and a group (Dollhopf, 2011:5) as it helps the individual to build social ties. This is still valuable in understanding the role of fashion in modern society as people within the same social network carry similar trends to each other and are consequently categorised the same way, for example in modern society those categorised as belonging to an \u2018indie\u2019 social group are categorised on factors such as the fashion trends they all adopt. However, this argument is only relevant to modern society in terms of the broader social categories people fall into as within the close knit groups people are more likely to associate with there is more diversity in the fashion trends of the group. This can be linked to Simmel\u2019s discussion of fashion as an expression of individuality because within society there is much more emphasis on fashion in relation to individualism rather than fashion as an expression of status. However, although there is a conflict between the need to express ones individuality and the desire to be socially accepted (Simmel, 1957:543) fashion still allows for the acceptance of an individual to a social group as it displays a sense of similarity between members allowing for them to build social ties. Therefore, Simmel\u2019s ideas in relation to fashion as both a facilitator of gaining acceptance into a social group and as an expression of individuality is still valuable in understanding modern society but it must be discussed that although the fashion trends an individual adopt categorises them into a broader social group it does not limit the individual to that social group as there is more emphasis on diversity within groups in modern society. Nevertheless, Simmel\u2019s ideas are still relevant to understanding the social function of fashion in modern society. <nl>Furthermore, Simmel argues that there is a relationship between fashion and social class divisions. He discusses how fashion provides a distinction between the upper and lower classes as it allows for the expression of status against the lower class as the trends the upper classes adopt aren\u2019t as easily accessible to the lower classes due to their economic position. In addition, he also discusses how fashion unifies the upper class by providing them with a collective dominance over the lower class (Simmel, 1957:541). This argument is valuable in understanding the social function of fashion in modern society as we see the continued division between social classes through the fashion trends they can access as the upper classes have the facilities to purchase the upmarket expensive trends of the wealthy whereas the lower classes are still limited to the fashion trends they can buy into, for example brands such as Gucci are more accessible to the upper classes due to their financial status. Simmel goes on to then discuss how once the fashion trends the upper classes have set are adopted by the lower classes the trends will then be abandoned and new trends will be established (Calhoun, 2012:372). This argument is still relevant today as we observe how trends are spread from those of the upper classes such as celebrities and are then adopted by lower classes as the lower market brands start to develop clothing that fits into the upper class trends making it more accessible to the lower classes and resulting in social class divisions based on these fashion trends being less distinct. However, not all trends in modern society stem from the upper classes as we see lower market high street brands setting trends which are then adopted and are easily accessible to all classes. Despite this, Simmel\u2019s discussion of fashion as an expression of social class status is still relevant to modern society as fashion is still limited to certain individuals based on their economic status meaning the expensive fashion trends and brands can still only be accessed by the upper classes who have the means to gain access which then creates the social class distinctions based on the fashion trends adopted by each class. Therefore, fashion has a social function of showcasing the differences between social classes and consequently their economic position as once trends become more accessible to lower classes they are then abandoned by the upper classes as they want to maintain the distinction and the dominance they have over the lower classes (Lizardo, 2019). Consequently, Simmel\u2019s ideas regarding social class and fashion are still relevant to modern society although it must be considered that not all trends are started by members of the upper classes and that not all members of the lower class desire to access the trends of the upper class. <nl>Moreover, Simmel examines the relationship between fashion and gender. He argues that fashion is primarily associated with women as it allows them to express their individuality in the oppressed position they are in (Helle, 2012:49). This argument is relevant to understanding modern society as fashion is still greatly associated with women however this argument is limited as fashion has expanded to be more related to men as well as fashion has become important as an expression of individuality for all members of society. Particularly, fashion has gained importance in the lives of young men who take more notice of the relevant fashion trends they wish to adopt. Therefore, although it is still relevant to suggest that fashion is more associated with women as we see in the media that fashion is more targeted at women than men it cannot be denied that fashion has become much more associated with men as well as we have progressed into modern society. Furthermore, the discussion that fashion is one of the ways women express themselves as an oppressed group is limited in its relevance as although women are still viewed as an oppressed group their position in society has greatly improved since the time Simmel was writing in with modern society making a great amount of progress in regards to equality for example with more women in employment. Simmel develops this argument by suggesting fashion accommodates for lack of status women can obtain from employment (Simmel, 1957:551). This argument is outdated as the percentage of women in employment has increased since the time Simmel was writing and as has essentially equalised with the number of men in employment therefore arguing fashion accommodates for the expression of status women cannot access from employment is not relevant to modern society. However, Simmel\u2019s idea that fashion provides a means of expression for women is relevant to understanding the social function of fashion in modern society however it is equally as important as a means for men to express themselves as women but it can be acknowledge that Simmel\u2019s idea that fashion is more associated with women is relevant in modern society as although it has become more relevant in the lives of men it is still primarily associated with women. <nl>In conclusion, Simmel\u2019s ideas about the social function of fashion are still valuable in understanding modern society. His arguments surrounding imitation and acceptance are still relevant as we observe people imitating trends set by those they view as desirable to copy and we see people adopting certain fashion trends to gain access to certain groups. In addition, Simmel\u2019s discussion of fashion as an expression of individuality is valuable and relevant in understanding the role of fashion in modern society however his argument that this has a higher importance in the lives of women due to their oppressed position is limited as women have made improvements in their position and fashion has become equally as important in the lives of men. Nevertheless, his discussion of fashion as a means of expressing status between the upper and lower classes is still relevant to society today as we see upper classes starting trends and abandoning them once they are adopted by the lower classes. Consequently, Simmel\u2019s work regarding the social function of fashion is relevant to society today as his ideas are applicable to several areas of society however it must be taken into account that some of his ideas are limited due to the developments made in society from the time Simmel was writing in.

{"anchor": "Dear Mrs Botago, I've done some research into some of the top places in Helsinki you might want to try whilst you're there,and I'll copy in the bookings team so they have the addresses if you want them. The hotel I'd recommend is the Hilton Helsinki Strand, it was that or the Radisson Blu but the Hilton had better rooms with a view (can't beat a window-facing bed in the morning!). - 217 Euros per night - Has all your basic hotel stuff, plus Hilton is great anyway - John Steinbergin ranta 4, Helsinki, 00530, Finland. - +358 9 39351 - Check-in 2pm, check-out 12pm For breakfast I found a cute little cafe 'Kuuma' nearby the hotel, great reviews, typical continental-type food, looks great in the sun. - Pohjoisesplanadi (say that fast five times) 33, 00100, Helsinki, Finland. - +358 40 6757772 - Doesn't look like you need to book though, just so you have the number If you're up for a museum trip, go-to looks like the National Musuem of Finland. Google maps it, looks hard to miss, it's huge. There seems to be a great restaraunt a short walk from the city centre, 'Ravintola Nokka', again, great reviews, by the water, and the food looks incredible (think traditional Helsinki but with a modern feel to it?). - Kanavaranta 7 F, 00160, Helsinki, Finland. If you're looking for a souvenier for Esmerelda, there's a traditional-type souvenier shop 'Liopro' just off Helsinki's central market square, plus it gives you a chance to give the market a look. There's also a massive 'Flying Tiger' in the city centre, it's not traditional Finland but it's brightly-coloured Copenhagen-themed stuff, probably a better bet for a young kid if I'm honest. For that night out, there's a brilliant looking rock club called 'Tavastia' nearby, live music and apparently one of Europe's oldest rock clubs? Worth a shot, if you're not a fan there's always a bar by the sea! Anyway those are the ones I found, have a look on tripadvisor and see if there's anything else you'd be up for while you're there?

(Experience Specsavers - Working at Specsavers - Specsavers People, 2020) Specsavers operates on a joint venture partnership, with each store owned and operated by local partners, who are qualified opticians. These partners are committed to delivering the highest standard of customer service. <nl><nl>Definition of the Business Problem<nl><nl>Specsavers stores, along with any other opticians, deal with interactions on a daily basis, whether it be in-store or via telephone. However, a lot of the time, these interactions are related to minor queries such as bookingre-arrangingcancelling appointments, checking upcoming appointment details, requesting prescriptions, or checking if glasses are in stock. <nl><nl>Currently, the option to book appointments online via the store website and cancel via the email sent regarding appointment booking confirmation is available. This has lowered the number of calls and walk-ins by a significant amount however there are still a large number of individuals who are unaware of this option. Consequently, time is taken up during the day.<nl>The directors of stores are constantly seeking ways of improving customer service. To do this, they need to understand how effective technology is in providing individuals with more freedom and the access to information from any location without having to visit or call a store. The research findings will be used to review and improve the technology.<nl><nl>Research Objectives<nl>The key question this research should answer therefore is:<nl>\u2022 How would the launch of an app benefit or worsen customers experiences and overall interactions with Specsavers?<nl><nl>Target Population<nl><nl>The target profile identified is as follows:<nl>\u2022 Customers who own a smartphone device<nl>\u2022 Customers who visit Specsavers<nl>\u2022 \u2018Direct Debit\u2019 scheme patients<nl>\u2022 Individuals who wear glasses andor contact lenses<nl>Research Design and Strategy<nl><nl>Based on the research objectives, it is recommended that a quantitative research design is implemented through the use of online questionnaires. Questionnaires are a \"set of questions designed to produce the data needed in order to meet the research objectives\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). The aim of this research is: \"To gain an insight into individuals\u2019 preferences as to whether or not they believe they would benefit from the launch of an app.\" The questionnaire will consist of various questions where the participant will rate their opinion using a Likert scale: \"A measurement scale where the respondent indicates a level of agreement or disagreement to the given statements\u2026\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). An example of the questionnaire is shown by appendix 1.<nl><nl>This method is most favourable as the sample population is large. Other survey methods such as telephone interviews or face-to-face interviews are time consuming as they require an individual (usually an experienced interviewer) to contact the participant and have a conversation with them. Therefore, for this research it is impractical. It is advised having a sample size of n=400, however, having a read of n=80 or above for each subgroup will allow to draw strong conclusions. The advantage is that it will be easier to analyse results amongst the subgroups specified in the target population. Quantitative methods aim for conclusiveness and generalisability. Therefore, once there is solid evidence to support the question, no further testing is required.<nl><nl>Sampling Approach<nl><nl>The most appropriate sampling technique is cluster sampling. This technique is part of \"probability sampling where the population is divided into groups\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018) and then randomly sampled from each group. This is the preferred method as it allows to select an equal number of participants per group, allowing for fairness and reliability. Cluster sampling involves gathering the entire population of the study and dividing them into clusters. Each cluster is a representation of the entire population. Once the clusters have been identified, certain clusters will be chosen using simple random sampling. Only the participants who meet one or more of the \u2018Target Population\" criteria will be used for the study. The unchosen clusters (those who do not meet the criteria) will remain unrepresented in the study. For this study, participants will be grouped by age, and then participants will be chosen randomly to be included in the data analysis. 100 participants per age group will be selected to allow fairness.  <nl><nl><nl><nl>Data Collection Method and Analysis<nl><nl>As mentioned previously, online questionnaires will be used due to the type of research being conducted and the size of the target sample population. Questionnaires will be sent out to every individual who has provided an e-mail address to Specsavers and given consent to receive the questionnaire. Online questionnaires allow the researcher to contact multiple participants at once. As a result, they have higher response rates as well as the ability to contact the hard-to-reach. Moreover, it is quick to create and allows for adaptability and personalisation of questions. There are no physical materials needed to send the questionnaire (paper, envelope etc.) so there are fewer expenses incurred. There may also be less bias as without an interviewer present, respondents are able to answer truthfully. Additionally, anonymity also encourages truthful answers.<nl><nl>Respondents will be given 4 weeks to complete the questionnaire from the date of visit to the store. Once completed, the results will be put onto a spreadsheet categorised by age (groups of 10 years). Once all 400 responses have been recorded, it will be analysed by calculating the averages of each question. This will help identify what customers prefer or not. For example, an average score of 1-3 shows customers disagree with the statements, 4 shows they are neutral, and a score between 5-7 means they agree. The ratings will give a good indication on whether it is beneficial to launch the app, and what features should be included.<nl><nl>A timings and costings table has been provided in the appendix (appendix 2) to highlight a more detailed overview of the length of the research project (3 months) and the total cost of the research project (\u00a328,000). <nl><nl>Ethical Issues<nl><nl>There are many ethical principles regarding the use of online surveys, the most important one being informed consent \u2013 participants within reason know what they are going to be doing. In addition, participation should be voluntary and anonymous. Questions should also avoid physical and psychological harm to the participants. All measures have been taken to ensure ethical principles have been followed. For example, informed consent will happen when customers arrive for their appointment. They will be asked whether they would like to partake in an online survey. If answered yes, only then will an e-mail containing the survey be sent.", "positive": "<addr5_FN>,<nl><nl>Hope you are well.

{"anchor": "Introduction <nl>The transformation from the original labour party to the New Labour party is a significant period in British political history. It was the introduction of a new ideology with similar social democratic values as the past but with the advantage of taking account the changes in the modern era; economically and socially etc. The following essay will focus mainly on the transformation since the 1990s with some reference to the past Labour party that originated before the 1990s. Also, the essay will specifically look at the domestic policies rather than foreign policies. The impact made can be split into focusing on the three main sectors; Health, education and Law &amp; Order. The essay will be discussing whether there has been a major shift in parties or whether it is the same but just holds a new name. Further analysing the positive and negative outcome of this development. Taking into consideration whether there will be a return of new labour. <nl><nl>What is the \u2018Old\u2019 Labour party? <nl>The beginning of the Labour party was in the 1900s (Reid, 1995). The main principle being the \u2018Labour party\u2019 was to take care of the industrial workers during the Queen Victoria Era.. They wanted to protect the rights of the working class who were thought to have different rights in comparison to those in higher classes and simply treated unfairly. The first Labour government wasn't formed till 1924 when prime minister Ramsey McDonald was in power. In the beginning, the Labour party started with only a few members. As a new party forming it was difficult to make decisions on whether the public should publicly make a stand on certain decisions. One of these was to make the \u2018people\u2019 only the centre of attention. Hence introducing \"reforms to improve working conditions and working-class living standards\" (Vickers, 2004).The support towards the \u2018people\u2019 influenced the votes. One of the influences of the ideology behind the Labour party is Socialist thinking. For instance, in the past, the Labour party used socialist theory to influence the formations of foreign policy (Vickers, 2004). This socialist or social-democratic way of thinking encouraged the Labour party to promote, the values of common ownership and equal opportunity. <nl> <nl>Labour is the second most popular party in the United Kingdom right after the Conservative party (The right-wing of the British political spectrum). Even in the 20th century, the Labour parties\u2019 values are still influenced by this socialist thinking. Most of the support and popularity the party gains is because, of its anti-capitalist position. Most new members of the Labour party in 2015 were seen as \"left behind\" by society because their view did not agree with those on the right of the political spectrum and have been deceived those on the left who feel \u2018left behind\u2019 and have been deceived by the developments of globalization which has caused social inequality (Whiteley et al., 2018). <nl>Currently, in 2019 Britain is under the conservatives \u2013 the right of the political spectrum. With <nl>the general elections scheduled to take place in December 2019, Labour is striving to get the nation on its side. Jeremy Corbyn; Leader of the Labour party and the rest of his party clearly states their vision. Within every policy set, the vision embedded is \" for the many, not the few\"(Labour party, 2019). This shows how the party is still upholding the original values it first held in the 19th century by promoting the values of equality rather than focusing on one group. <nl><nl>What is the \u2018New\u2019 Labour party? <nl>New Labour was introduced as the face of the 'new' Labour party introduced by then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. After 18 years of Britain being under the power of the conservatives, the nation finally saw the Labour party return (O'Broin, 1997). Tony Blair of Scottish origin became prime minister on the 2nd of May in 1997 after John Major had resigned. The party introduced the ideology of \"New Labour\" which focused on bringing a new approach to modernise the economy by finding a middle ground between traditional socialism and the free market economy. This is also known as the \u2018third way\u2019. Moving it from the left of the political scale to the centre. <nl>The \"Labour Party Manifesto\" of 1997 said that New Labour rejected the old approaches of \"the old left and those of the Conservative Right\" (Labour-party.org.uk, 1997). It looked for a new way that would appeal to everyone rather than just one perspective. The parties manifesto promised constitutional change and looked at improving services important to the public like the NHS service and finding new ways to help troubled students mainly in deprived areas. This quickly increased Blairs' popularity amongst not only the sick but those in education too. Also, Blair was able to heavily adjust the Policies revolving the law to keep the nation safe therefore he was supported by the general public. <nl>However, his popularity did not last long. Even though Blair attempted to change the face of Labour in a positive way some of his reforms came across as quite radical. For instance, in 1998 university students were asked to pay for tuition fees. Most Students to this day only remember him as the prime minister who re-introduced tuition fees. Other controversial issues just like this pressurised Blair into resigning as prime minister on the 27th of June in 2007 (Blair, 2007). <nl>The New Labour period carried on until 2010 with the aid of prime minister Gordon Brown but after 2010 prime minister David Cameron was appointed and Britain returned to the power of the conservatives (Heffernan, 2011).<nl> <nl>What are the similarities? <nl>New Labour in some perspectives can be seen as \"Continuous with \u2018Old\u2019\" (Allender, 2001). Even though the party has reintroduced itself as a new ideology it still promotes the same values as \u2018old' Labour but instead, it has adapted to the modern world. The outcomes that the Labour party wants to achieve are still similar but the processes have changed. For example, instead of simply giving people what they want, they encouraged people to improve themselves and to find work. <nl>New Labour still concentrates on \"fairness and social justice\" (Temple, 2000).The Labour party was built originally on the idea that everyone deserves the same opportunities. Therefore, Blair was able to introduce a minimum wage in 1998(O'Hara, 2018). This way no one is paid incorrectly and instead, the pay was in alliance with the cost of living in the society, However, some may argue not everyone is treated equally because the pay depends on the individuals' age. Each age group has a different set of minimum wages. So instead it has caused further inequalities. <nl>According to an article written by the guardian, these pledges New Labour was making were what \"Labour had been making for decades and had failed in the past to keep\" (The Guardian, 2005). Therefore, supporters of New Labour could argue that in fact, it was just a party that was taking care of 'Old' Labours' reputation. They were not able to fulfil the promises made to the nation in the past. So New Labour was responsible for damage control and making sure that the Labour name was not tarnished. <nl>Unfortunately for many, one of the sad similarities is that both parties still brought Labour down. Through their time in parliament, they did not fully satisfy the nation. Before New Labour came into power, Britain thought they had hope in this new party since the previous Labour government had left them feeling \"betrayed\" (BBC News, 2010). Even though this huge support brought a rise in New Labour they suffered a fall too when there were economic crises such as the \"credit crunch\" and increases in \"income tax\". <nl><nl>What are the differences? <nl>The main difference that is widely focused on is the \"\u2018modernisation\u2019 element\" which it had done to \"catch up with the times\". (Allender, 2001).This is important for a political party that wants to gain support from the nation. This does not only apply for the elder generations but also for the youth who are seeing the changes to the nation. Therefore, they would be more inclined to vote for a party that looks at the modern aspects rather than the old. <nl>When Labour was not doing as good in terms of gaining interest, a decision was made to start changing and abandoning the traditional aim of only supporting the working class. So, there was a shift from being at the left of the political meter to the centre(Allender, 2001). New Labour no longer wanted to focus on just the working class thus widening its support group. <nl>Different periods meant different types of thinking had to be introduced. This explains why after the second world war \"Keynesian\" ethics were correct to use or after Thatcher left power it was time to adapt to neoliberal ideologies (Allender, 2001). Blair decided to amend clause IV which meant it disassociated Labour from socialist thinking. It did this by starting to reduce \"trade union power and influence within the Labour movement\" (Robinson, n.d.). Thus, focusing more on the consumers rather than producers. <nl>\"Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" (O'Hara, 2018).Thus clearly showed Blair had much stronger attitudes to law and order. Traditional Labour looked at economical or sociological factors to determine the \"cause of the crime\" yet Blair refused to completely do this (New Statesman, 2015) .Blair was able to spend more money on policing, making the public aware to be cautious and prevent them from committing crimes. This way New Labour was able to make a significant impact on the level of crime committed resulting in a safer environment for everyone. <nl>Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).The \"coalition\u2019s 'social justice' strategy\" was considered to help those who were disadvantaged because of their environment and upbringing. New Labour wanted to make sure that those who were in the lower or middle classes still could be as successful as those in the higher class. <nl><nl>What were the positive outcomes of New Labour? <nl>Blair made more investments other than only in the law and order sector. For instance in the education sector. Spending more money on children and the younger generation meant it would help them stay focused and not on the streets. Influencing them to do positive things that could shape their future but also one of the future societies they would later form. New Labour's \"number one priority\" was education as promised in the parties\u2019 manifesto of 1997 (Heath et al., 2013). <nl>This was later proved when achievements were made. Their investing and prioritisation achieved results such as only \"one in twelve\" secondary schools were below the basic minimum standard. This was a big development in comparison to nearly half of all schools below standard in 1997 when New Labour acknowledged the area of needed development. <nl>Funding in the health department was also increased. An article writing about that period claims There was a \" huge injection of money\" into the NHS (The Guardian, 2007). This was a change because past tory governments did not spend that much. This meant there would be in decrease like waiting times at the A&amp;E but also better facilities to access. This brought the social group of those who were sick or disabled to create stronger support for the New Labour parties' reforms. <nl>Businesses and those interested in the market system were fond of New Labours' new policies revolving the market. New Labour had thought of the \"prawn cocktail offensive\" (Giddens, 2010). This was a strategy that influenced the support from those in the finance society. This type of market economics gave consumers much more freedom in making decisions that would impact their businesses in comparison to the previous government. Due to the fact, these groups were now given shared responsibility, they felt more a part of the nation rather than before where decisions were being made without their input. <nl><nl>What were the negative outcomes of the New Labour Party? <nl>Some argued that New Labour was just \" Thatcherism continued\" (Dorling, 2010). Critique Danny Dorling argued that New Labour did not achieve anything. Instead, Blair followed the same steps as Thatcher and this resulted in the income equalities to further rise instead of creating a difference that Blair had promised. The build-up to New Labour allowing more of the NHS to become private or the introduction to university tuition fees meant a result of wealth inequality. Again, only those with money in their pockets were given more opportunities and better services. <nl>Those who look at it from a 'Relational' perspective could argue that the nation was \"encouraged... to be \u2018consumers\u2019 of services rather than participants\" (IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research), 2016). This means there is a possibility more public services were reformed into becoming privatized. Those\u2019 participants\u2019 who are not fortunate enough wouldn't be able to be consumers. Supporters of \u2018old' Labour were not pleased by this \"privatization by stealth\" (Vidler and Clarke, 2005). Due to the fact it just carried on creating inequalities. <nl>State welfare was not a reform everyone was pleased with. In an article analysing \"social democratic values\" (Shaw, 2003).Writer Eric Shaw discusses the idea of \"poverty traps\". Are people benefiting from the state welfare if the amount of money given is provisional and only certain groups in society are benefiting from this? An article discussing poverty within the Labour party believes New Labour seems to be instead of using poverty traps as a means to \" justify its welfare reforms\" (Stepney, Lynch and Jordan, 1999). It holds its traditional value by allowing wealth to be distributed equally. However, it withholds the nation's full support by making the rich believe they are making the poor wealthier which makes them believe it is unfair. <nl>Some could argue that New Labour spent way too much money. New Labour made many promises in its manifestos to the nation so it had to try and achieve them. Their journey to handling \" social exclusion\" meant \"heavy. Investments (such as) \u00a31.7 billion (was) spent on the New Deal for Communities\" Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).However, even after all this money, there was always more problems following the ones that were solved. For instance, the recovering support needed afterward for those who had a problem with drugs was not given. Therefore, not every single social group was fully satisfied. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>Unfortunately for some the New Labour party saw a rise and then a fall. Britain has not seen the Labour party return back to power since 2010. Instead, the conservatives have managed to win the elections and gain the interests of the public. In the upcoming 2019 December general elections Labour has been greatly promoted but as just as the \u2018Labour Party\u2019. Since 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was appointed as Labour party leader he shifted Labour on the political scale back to the left from the centre (Bowie,2018). Due to the fact New Labour promoted its modernised values, there\u2019s a possibility in the future Blairs Labour could be developed and improved to meet the needs of those who disapproved of the shift to the centre. However, New Labours' dramatic fall in history and negatives outcomes could discourage the public trust in such a party. Throughout this exploration of the transformation from 'Old' Labour to New Labour, you can see clearly that there are more differences than similarities. Blair tried to change the face of Labour huge but failed to make it work. This can be shown through how the negative outcome heavily outweighs the positives. To conclude, the transformation did make a big impact on British history however not a good one. Blair worked very hard to please the nation and achieve everything he promised yet it wasn't possible to satisfy everyone and also wrong decision led to negative outcomes that Labour will be remembered for.

{"anchor": "Abstract <nl>59 undergraduate psychology students replicated the Stroop test (Stroop, 1935) by identifying the colour of the font of 60 stimulus words in two conditions: congruent, where the ink colour is consistent with the word itself, and incongruent, where the ink colour is different to the word itself. The results showed that the reaction time for the incongruent condition was longer than the congruent condition. This can be supported by the selective attention theory, which states that it requires more attention to name the ink colours than to read the words (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The future implications of the Stroop test and results of the study involve the ability to identify certain brain regions (MacLeod, 2015). <nl>Introduction<nl>The Stroop Test, introduced by Stroop (1935), is a neuropsychological test which assesses the ability to suppress cognitive interference when the processing of one stimulus slows down the processing of a second stimulus (Scarpina and Tagini, 2017). In Stroop\u2019s first experiment, he used five words and their matching ink colours, and participants were instructed to read each word aloud as fast as possible. In experiment 2, participants had to read the ink colours aloud rather than the word itself. The experimental condition was incongruent as the word was not the same as the colour of the ink. Participants had a longer reaction time when they were instructed to name the ink colour of the incongruent words compared to the congruent words in the control condition (MacLeod, 1991). <nl>This effect can be explained by the selective attention theory, as naming the ink colours required more attention than reading the words, hence these simultaneous stimuli were processed differently (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The interference Stroop effect demonstrated further led to the development of the Stroop Test. Literature suggests that this is a consistent effect, with results of the Stroop test having high reliability (Siegrist, 1995). This gives rise to the hypothesis that the reaction time for the incongruent condition, where the words and font colour are different, will be longer than the congruent condition.<nl>Method<nl>Participants:<nl>59 undergraduate psychology students from their first year at Aston University were recruited for this experiment via opportunity sampling.<nl><nl>Design:<nl>The design was repeated measures and the independent variable was the congruency of the font colour and the meaning of the word itself, with two levels being congruent and incongruent. The dependent variable was the reaction time (in milliseconds) for participants to name the font colour in each condition.<nl><nl>Materials:<nl>PsychoPy was used to implement the design of the experiment and collect reaction time data. The stimulus words for the congruent condition were \u2018red\u2019 in a red font, \u2018green\u2019 in a green font, and \u2018blue\u2019 in a blue font. The stimulus words for the incongruent condition were \u2018red\u2019 in a green font, \u2018green\u2019 in a blue font, and \u2018blue\u2019 in a red font. The response options available were the left arrow for red, the up arrow for green, and the right arrow for blue. <nl><nl>Procedure:<nl>Participants gave informed consent prior to conducting the experiment. They were instructed to identify the colour of the font the word was printed in, by pressing the corresponding responses on the keyboard. The stimuli were presented in a randomised and counterbalanced order. Participants saw the 6 stimulus types 10 times, with 60 trials in total. They then identified the colour of the font of the words by pressing the keyboard as fast as possible, with the keyboard response signalling the next trial. The reaction times for each trial were stored and saved for further analysis.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Table 1.<nl><table><nl><nl>As the hypothesis suggested, the mean for the incongruent condition is higher than the congruent condition (Table 1). The low standard deviations show that results did not vary highly in both conditions, suggesting that results may be consistent within each condition. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in reaction times between incongruent and congruent conditions at a 95% confidence level (Z= -3.638, p= .001). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The research hypothesis was supported as the reaction time for the incongruent condition was significantly longer than that of the congruent condition, which was consistent with previous research by Stroop (1935).<nl>A limitation of the study was the small sample size and type of participants tested, as the results from only 59 undergraduate psychology students fail to produce an accurate representation of the general population. This is shown by Hackshaw (2008), explaining that small sample sizes produce results which overestimate the magnitude of the difference. To improve this, a wider sample size extending outside of the university would be required to assess whether the results are truly reliable. Additionally, the risk of demand characteristics due to the Stroop test being well-known may mean that participants would deliberately take a longer time to identify the colour of the font in the incongruent condition compared to the congruent condition. Research participants are likely to hypothesise an aim of the study when they are aware that they are being observed (Hogg and Cooper, 2007). This could be remedied by introducing a pilot study where participants are asked about their perception of the aim of the study upon completion, allowing for the adaptation of the instructions and presentation of stimuli according to their responses. <nl>Future implications of the Stroop test include its ability in testing the function of associated brain regions (MacLeod, 2015), and the understanding of cognitive interference. This therefore allows for further research on brain regions related to the Stroop test, assisting in treatment and recovery of individuals with brain damage in these areas. Future research testing various groups of people, such as cognitively impaired, could provide useful when investigating which brain regions affect reaction times in the incongruent condition, demonstrating the full extent of the effect of the Stroop test.", "positive": " <addr6_NN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Just thought I'd drop a message to let you know that my housemate has tested positive for coronavirus.

{"anchor": "Rationale:<nl>The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today\u2019s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual\u2019s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual\u2019s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><nl>Discourse 1- negativity of social media<nl>Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl> <nl>Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. <nl><nl>Discourse 2- vital for families<nl>Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. <nl><nl>Discourse 3- loneliness <nl>Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely.<nl><nl>Discourse 4- social media not healthy<nl>Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved.<nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely.<nl>Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling.

In brevity, if this is just a hunch then my dissertation can prove difficult. <nl><nl>To be fair, my actual aim was to conduct an interview with people to get answers to support my argument. The plan was to get 8 participants (4 who live in the U.K. and 4 who live in <country>) and ask specifically tailored questions to see the differing views. I also planned to have 4 older people (2 female, 2 male) and 4 younger people (2 female and 2 male) to see if there\u2019s a difference in perspectives due to age. Do you think this can be a replacement for not having existing secondary data surveys out there to confirm this connection or disconnection or it would still be weak?<nl><nl>Although <pers_FN> is right, I do know it\u2019s a real thing because I have also experienced this when I was in <country> earlier this year; it\u2019s just unfortunate that there aren\u2019t any specific surveys and forms of data that answers this question.

These firms have had a significant boost since 2002; also referred to as the \u2018going global era.\u2019 They tend to come from emerging, upper-middle income economies and developing countries and use a variety of entry modes such as joint ventures, strategic alliances and wholly owned subsidiaries (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). However, the majority choose to expand rapidly into developed countries using M&amp;A\u2019s and are late movers. A growing number of EMNE\u2019s are starting to dominate certain industries such as banking, telecommunications and engineering and outward FDI from emerging countries is increasing. For example, China has increased its presence within the Fortune 500 between 2004 and 2019; whilst the presence of US firms has started to decrease, showing the ever-growing dominance of EMNE\u2019s (Fortune Global 500, 2004,2019). There\u2019s several firms many of us from the western world may not have realised are owned by EMNE\u2019s, such as Tetley being owned by TATA \u2013 an Indian conglomerate; meaning it owns several different types of businesses and McVitie\u2019s being owned by Turkish EMNE, Yildiz Holding.<nl>This essay will highlight the key differences between MNE\u2019s and EMNE\u2019s and examine how effective current theories are at explaining outward FDI from emerging country multinationals and compare and contrast them to the more recent theories which have been developed; including the LLL model and Springboard theory. Some academics believe these new EMNE\u2019s have different motivations, which don\u2019t necessarily fit in with the traditional theories; whilst others think that these theories can be applied just as effectively as the newer ones. <nl>Key differences between traditional western MNE\u2019s and EMNE\u2019s<nl>Only a decade ago many EMNE\u2019s, which are booming today and challenging some of the most established MNE\u2019s in many industries, were marginal competitors. So how have they managed to do this in such a short space of time and be successful? It\u2019s important to look at the key characteristics of both traditional MNE\u2019s and the newer EMNE\u2019s to see what makes them so different. A main difference is the speed they internationalise. Many traditional MNE\u2019s expand gradually, following the Uppsala model whereby they expand into countries which are psychologically close considering factors such as, geography, shared language and shared cultures. On the other hand, EMNE\u2019s expand at a more accelerated pace. They do this to close the gap between their market reach and the global presence of MNE\u2019s from developed countries (Mathews, 2006). A good example of an EMNE which has expanded rapidly is Chinese firm Huawei. In just five years, despite starting as a domestic firm in 2001, it was operating in over 100 countries by 2006. It did this by providing solid technology at low prices and hiring low cost engineers at 20% of western rates. This allowed them to strongly compete against western MNE\u2019s and expand quickly (Fey et al, 2016). EMNE\u2019s also use latecomer advantage whereby they learn from mistakes of MNE\u2019s already established in the market and do better themselves. MNE\u2019s are essentially used as \u2018guinea pigs.\u2019 With regards to ownership advantages many MNE\u2019s have the required resources available to them internally; making this a big advantage if they were to expand into developing countries. However, EMNE\u2019s are sometimes seen as having weak ownership advantages, but many believe this is debatable as their institutional advantages are so strong and they can also just obtain resources and capabilities through M&amp;A\u2019s; which would naturally upgrade their ownership advantages. <nl>Institutional advantages are another key element to consider when comparing the firms. It\u2019s well documented that traditional MNE\u2019s have struggled significantly in countries with institutional voids as they\u2019re used to political stability; due to coming from countries with highly stable environments. As a result, they don\u2019t have the same experiences to cope with instability in the same way as EMNE\u2019S. New EMNE\u2019s are known to have this as a big advantage over traditional MNE\u2019s, as they\u2019re used to dealing and complying with discretionary and unstable governments in their domestic countries, therefore meaning they\u2019re better prepared to succeed in foreign countries with weak institutional environments (Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Genc, 2008). It\u2019s also believed that if EMNE\u2019s can successfully thrive in unstable developing countries, they most certainly can be successful in stable, developed countries. Finally, there\u2019s key differences in the organisational adaptability of MNE\u2019s versus EMNE\u2019s. It\u2019s believed that EMNE\u2019s are much more adaptable than MNE\u2019s which tend to suffer from inertia, by being stuck in their ways, as they have deeply ingrained values, cultures and organisational structures (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). Consequently, they tend to have lower success rates with M&amp;A\u2019s due to their lack of adaptability - almost two thirds of acquisitions by western firms end in failure, as the acquirer doesn\u2019t give flexibility to the firm acquired. On the other hand, EMNE\u2019s tend to have a high M&amp;A success rate - 67% success rate, as their adaptability is high, and they appreciate the firm they acquire more; due to their lack of global presence. <nl>Existing theories and their relevance<nl>Two major theories which explain the existing ways firms expand overseas successfully are Dunning\u2019s Eclectic Paradigm and the Uppsala Model. Dunning uses OLI theory to explain why firms use outward FDI; suggesting the key advantages as being ownership advantages, location advantages and internalisation advantages. Ownership advantages refer to valuable resources and capabilities a firm offers a country it expands into, which gives them a competitive advantage. Many argue that due to their lack of capabilities and resources, coming from developing countries, EMNE\u2019s can\u2019t satisfy this part of the OLI paradigm. Going by Dunning\u2019s explanation this would mean that they\u2019re unable to engage in outward FDI, however many still do and are proven successful. Furthermore, some believe EMNE\u2019s from developing countries could be considered to have ownership disadvantages, as they lack a well-known image and may not have the ability to compete on the same scale as western MNE\u2019s, who have larger finances and advanced technologies (Fey et al, 2016). In addition, location advantages are required by Dunning to expand overseas effectively; this is what host countries can offer to a firm undertaking FDI there (Dunning, 1979). However, many EMNE\u2019s don\u2019t go abroad to access location advantages, such as lower cost production, lower labour costs or cheaper technology; as they already have this available to them in their domestic markets. For example, many Chinese firms won\u2019t outsource their production to a developed country if they\u2019re to expand their firm into them, because it\u2019s well documented that production and labour within China can be done at a much cheaper cost to say that in the US.  As both ownership advantages and location advantages aren\u2019t satisfied in the OLI paradigm, it makes it possible to say that the theory could become redundant or less relevant as more EMNE\u2019S become successful in developed markets; without having satisfied all three elements within the paradigm. <nl>Secondly, the Uppsala model is another model used to explain the internationalisation of firms. It emphasises how firms go abroad incrementally and increase commitments gradually. This may mean they go into countries close to their domestic market first. A firm may first export to a country, then open an overseas subsidiary and finally build or acquire their own factory abroad as they gain more knowledge about the market and establish their operations. EMNE\u2019S are unfortunately thought to leapfrog some steps outlined above and may even start the internationalisation process by becoming \u2018born global\u2019 and setting up the factory first. According to Eriksson et al (2000), the Uppsala Model is based on the idea that the behaviour of the internationalisation process is path dependent. Path dependence is a process based on the accumulated knowledge from the firm\u2019s past international experience, which directs the firm\u2019s future trajectory (Eriksson et al, 2000). A main concern is that Uppsala explains this path dependence but EMNE\u2019s have no experience in developed countries to use. As a result, they can only use knowledge of developing countries. On the other hand, MNE\u2019s know all about operating in developed markets so are at a bigger advantage. Finally, part of the Uppsala model is the idea of psychic distance - entering countries psychologically close. A main issue with this idea is that EMNE\u2019s may not be able to use psychic distance to enter developed countries because they\u2019re so different in nature. For example, developing countries may have stronger cultural, language, political and legal differences to developed countries. This would also be the case for MNE\u2019s looking to expand into developing countries. <nl>The development of new theories<nl>As time has progressed new theories have been developed to try to explain and analyse how these new EMNE\u2019s have used outward FDI to expand their presence internationally. The reason for creating these theories is because many couldn\u2019t understand how these firms from countries with weaker country specific advantages could compete against the firms from developed countries. At first glance, it appears these EMNE\u2019s have weaker firm specific advantages compared to their western rivals. <nl>The springboard theory was created (Luo and Tung, 2007) to explain why these firms expand so aggressively and the drivers behind this. The theory highlights seven elements. The first being that EMNE\u2019s use their international expansion to compensate for their ownership disadvantages; this means that to counteract the fact they can\u2019t offer a lot initially in terms of resources to the new market, they expand internationally and benefit from other means such as gaining resources from another firm through a M&amp;A. Immediately, this makes the OLI paradigm seem less relevant, as it\u2019s highlighting that they can still be a success without initial ownership advantages. The second element of the theory says that EMNE\u2019s use the international expansion to overcome their latecomer disadvantage; this means that they benefit from being able to see where MNE\u2019s have made mistakes and ensuring they don\u2019t make the same ones. Next, it explains that MNE\u2019s from developing countries use international expansion as a springboard to counter-attack global rivals\u2019 major foothold in their home country market. It also outlines that EMNE\u2019s use outward FDI as a springboard to bypass certain trade barriers, such as quotas and anti-dumping penalties. This means that they go into another developingemerging markets with fewer restrictions. For example, if a Chinese firm were to set up a foreign subsidiary or production in Mexico and then export their good to the US. This again goes against the OLI paradigm as the firm isn\u2019t directly using the location advantages of the US for production in the example above. Instead, they\u2019re choosing to use those of Mexico to then sell in the US. Furthermore, the theory says new emerging MNE\u2019s expand internationally to alleviate domestic institutional constraints. This for example could be if their home country doesn\u2019t have strong patent laws, so they take their product elsewhere to be better protected therefore, benefitting from the county\u2019s location advantage of having stronger patent protection. The final two elements explain that EMNE\u2019s use international expansion to both secure preferential treatment offered by emerging governments and exploit their competitive advantage in other markets. To secure preferential treatment a domestic firm, say an Indian firm, may set up a subsidiary within the UK and then invest back into India to gain the tax benefit and the preferential government treatment. <nl>A second new theory developed is the LLL model (Mathews, 2006). This model has similarities to the Springboard theory in the way it explains why EMNE\u2019s expand and internationalise. However, the key takeaway is that it says EMNE\u2019s go abroad and then they learn. This is a massive contrast to the Uppsala model which emphasises the gradual process of expansion and firms using the knowledge they already possess to expand into markets with similarities, that are psychologically close. Firms going abroad and then learning highlights a more aggressive approach to expansion.  The three L\u2019s in the model stand for linkage, leverage and learning. The linkage element examines the collaborations between EMNE\u2019s and foreign firms through entry modes such as joint ventures, M&amp;A\u2019s and alliances. Leverage explains that EMNE\u2019s exploit global linkages to become \u2018latecomers\u2019 by harnessing resources and cost advantages to compete globally.  The second \u2018L\u2019 really highlights the idea that firms go abroad and then learn from the foreign partners already in the market and demonstrates why Dunning\u2019s theory is less relevant of initially having certain ownership advantages to be successful. Finally, the learning element is the stage where EMNE\u2019s acquire competitive advantages and learn how to compete internationally. Firms don\u2019t need initial advantages necessarily; as they can expand and then learn and therefore become competitive. Overall, this model argues that firms acquire resources and learn over time before internationalisation occurs and the EMNE is integrated into the international activities. <nl>Although these theories have been developed and are more tailored to the new types of EMNE\u2019s, they do still have their drawback such as underestimating the importance of absorption capacity and they go against the path dependence theory; as expressed in the Uppsala model. Finally, it\u2019s clear that the importance of ownership advantages is dismissed; which is a key element in the existing OLI paradigm. <nl>In summary, it\u2019s evident EMNE\u2019s and traditional MNE\u2019s differ both in the way they operate and the way they internationalise. Key differences include the speed EMNE\u2019s internationalise compared with MNE\u2019s and how differently they use or even don\u2019t use their initial ownership advantages to ensure success abroad. Although they have their differences, both types of firm have proven to be successful in their own ways. However, there\u2019s still a huge question mark over how these newer EMNE\u2019s have prevailed so much globally. Thus, newer theories have been developed to try and explain this dominance. It must be said that although these new theories more accurately explain the rapid growth of EMNE\u2019s and why having ownership advantages isn\u2019t as essential as some older theories may suggest; they do still have their criticisms, as explained above. Consequently, further theories may have to be developed which are more accurate and less open to scrutiny. However, it really depends on individual views as to which theories are considered more relevant. Some would argue Dunning and the Uppsala model have been used for many years and can still be used effectively today, whilst others may say the world is constantly changing, as seen with the recent rise of EMNE\u2019s, and therefore it\u2019s necessary to keep developing and updating new theories. This will make them most effective and relevant to the current situations firms and countries find themselves in. For example, Carl Fey and others developed a new 5M framework which guides academics in their understanding of the internationalisation of EMNE\u2019s (Fey et al, 2009). It proved that internationalisation is challenging for any firm. The largest challenge for EMNE\u2019s, which is not always covered by the older theories, is overcoming the problem of a negative country image (Y.Y. Chang et al., 2009; E.Chang &amp; Taylor., 1999; Ferner et al., 2005; Smith &amp; Meiksins, 1995). It\u2019s the job of newer theories to potentially provide insight into how EMNE\u2019\u2019s can overcome this challenge.", "positive": " could end up killing people tho you don't get that do you<new>Tier 3 is tier 3 you can't be ignorant to this. <county> has 3 hospitals in top 10 for being overwhelmed and they can't do normal operations due to number of beds x<new>This is serious!

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>This essay will discuss the notion that conscionability is regarded as a \u2018dangerous black horse\u2019. Though it poses \u2018immediate danger to the foundations of the law\u2019  it holds a certain appeal within Equity. Further, it will criticise Birk\u2019s position that this \u2018amorphous concept\u2019 simply conceals to private intuition. As this piece progresses, opinions of scholars who propose unique and interesting alternatives will be analysed with the final position being that Birks\u2019 does not wholly present a modern perspective on such a diverse definition. <nl><nl>Outdated approach<nl>Perhaps to consider the role of conscience within legal disputes, one should turn to their private intuition. However, to venture into this \u2018uncertain terrain\u2019, by adopting a narrow approach, the courts are reversing the trends of equity. Birk\u2019s reliance upon private intuition directly contradicts legal decision-making and therefore, for judges to rely on their intuitive conscience gives rise to additional subjectivity and seriously harms the rule of law. Nonetheless, it raises the concern as to why this indefinable concept of unconscionability should be accepted. Maxwell states that this terminology conflicts with values of certainty; the law must facilitate prediction rather than accept terms which are heavily subjective and uncertain. <nl><nl>Additionally, though conscience can be criticized for its \u2018judicial moral subjectivism\u2019, when judges make these decisions, they are essentially moral and based on \u2018normative practices (\u2026) that already exist in society and outside the law\u2019. Therefore, this private intuition is really the perception individuals have when interpreting external standards of morality and Dworkin asserts that judges interpret this morality by presupposing laws of the community. Instead, the flawed doctrine of Equity gives rise to scepticism as opposed to conscience itself. <nl><nl>Conscience, subjectivity &amp; The Rule of Law <nl>To understand conscience, it is vital to consider opinions of scholars when assessing the truth in Birks\u2019 statement. Perhaps looking at the rule of law can provide better clarification. Harding suggests that there must be a \u2018counterbalance\u2019 for the continued use of unconscionability because society can lose respect for the law if legal rules are not strictly applied in situations where exploitation of unjust outcomes are used for personal gain. Though conscience is \u2018expressive\u2019, it remains impossible to anticipate eventuality, therefore, mechanisms must be established to protect formal rules from being opportunistically exploited. Equity serves as this very mechanism by supplementing common law and the adjustment of rules adhering to extra-legal standards. Here, different observations of equity are presented and Birks\u2019 reliance on intuition seems questionable. <nl><nl>When observing conscience in equity, formal rules have been altered to make perfect moral sense. In common law and equitable liabilities, the courts consider \u2018moral clarity\u2019 rather than blindly following law. There is an evaluative aspect here where subjective interpretation is necessary to encourage \u2018moral deliberation\u2019. Moreover, it is odd to refute inherent subjectivity within private law reasoning. This encourages a mechanical, undesirable process inhibiting the progression of equity. Nonetheless, when considering these obligations, not all moral duties can be enforceable and there is great debate on whether legal obligations \u2018invariably\u2019 gives rise to moral ones. But should it be accepted that equitable obligations enforce moral duties, the individual must consider what they should morally do as opposed to what the law asserts. <nl><nl>Agnew suggests that instead of \u2018private intuition\u2019, reflecting morally upon a situation contributes to the authority of private law with \u2018moral legitimacy\u2019 being easier accepted. It is easier to conform to this ideal in contrast to Birks\u2019 highly plain and systematic approach. However, Birks critiques remain superior in that invocation of conscience in relation to equitable obligations generate great confusion and legal uncertainty. This does not seem to be a \u2018realistic aspiration\u2019 of the law. Confusion arises where it is difficult to assume differences between directly enforceable moral duties, and equitable obligations that have no legal standing. Agnew proposes that to limit conscience to cases where courts underwrite moral duties as legal or equitable obligations seems more appropriate. There is greater transparency but its \u2018explanatory limits\u2019 must be properly understood. This would fix the need to rely on personal intuition. Nonetheless, courts must be willing to accept a precautionary approach by addressing the confusion conscience poses in the first place.  <nl><nl>The influence of conscience in the courts <nl>Though conscience prevents the \u2018rigidity of rules\u2019, its unspecific nature leaves plenty of debate regarding its judicial discretion and capricious outcomes\u2019. Firstly, equitable remedies must be freely available when the claimant\u2019s sole action is to prove unconsciousable behaviour. Case law supports this position with judges asserting that demonstrating unconscionability would suffice. Lord Denning submits that when combining resulting and constructive trusts, they can be imposed \u2018where justice and good conscience require it\u2019. Nonetheless, critique indeed expected. In the case of Lloyd\u2019s Bank Plc v Rossett, concern over this broader approach was quickly reined in by the House of Lords and the shift towards a more selective one was needed. This concept is well represented in Australian case law where there is greater emphasis of conscience within equity. In the case of Tanwar, when assessing \"unconsciousable conduct\u2019, the court determined that it \u2018encourages false notions\u2019, and it is an \u2018equitable defence\u2019. Therefore, conscience must demonstrate liability; it is a \u2018baseline to judge behaviour\u2019. Similarly, in Cobbe v Yeoman\u2019s Row, conscience was referred to as an \u2018objective value judgement\u2019. This suggests conscience as an objective criterion to judge behaviour. Though Birks states that conscience is unspecific, conflicting case law argues quite the opposite; it is appropriate to assume conscience as this baseline in which actions of unreasonable nature are assessed correctly.  <nl><nl>Nonetheless, conscience gives excessive discretionary power to judges. For judges to assume subjective perspectives on a case-by-case basis undermines the integrity of the judiciary and the concept of equity. Within law, certainty is imperative, and an objective conscience allows the law to be better respected and clearly defined. This perceived subjectivity and arbitrariness has existed for many years with post-medieval judgements slowly fading the true definition of conscience.  Therefore, with its endless interpretations, it remains unsurprising that uncertainty remains. Regardless, though it appears that centrality of conscience has been reaffirmed in modern times, equity still lacks clarity within the courts. It was held in Harris v Williams-Wynne, that where a property covenant was breached, the test the courts took in determining whether the act was unconscionable would be for the claimant to enforce their rights at the date of breach. In these instances, judges focus on the facts of \u2018each individual case\u2019. Consequently, this language directly conflicts with the \u2018value of certainty in commercial life\u2019. Though he does not explicitly agree with Birks, Turner states that there is a severe \u2018lack of judicial guidance\u2019. But Hudson disagrees in that conscience is \u2018deeply misunderstood\u2019. Though these two scholars present contrasting perspectives to that of Birks, they also conflict with each other; it can be said that conscience is a curious concept that brings forth debates.  Opposing views give rise to further discretion, possibly damaging the overall meaning of conscience.  <nl><nl>Conscience &amp; trusts<nl>In the case of resulting trusts, Lord Browne presents an argument in Westdeutsche asserting that equitable jurisdiction to enforce trusts depends on the conscience of those who\u2019s legal interest is being affected. One cannot be considered a trustee if he was unaware of the facts that affect his conscience; unaware to hold the property for others in the case of a constructive or implied trust where it would directly influence his conscience. This poses great problems. For the enforcement of proprietary trusts to depend on the conscience of the legal interest being affected\u2019 seems flawed, it greatly affects the law relating to the creation of these interests and confusion is bound to occur. Though he states that an equitable interest, once created will be enforceable against a holder of the property \u2018without notice\u2019, it is confusing to align this with his comments where enforceability depends on the conscience of the holder. There is a distinguishing feature here; it does not make sense to assume that conscience of the recipient should be affected \u2018but for\u2019 this lack of notice: that it gives rise to a resulting trust. The creation of such interests influence other factors, namely risks and insurance; Birks states that this cannot be left to vague measures of conscience. Therefore, this confusion is \u2018intolerable\u2019. The need for conscience to be integrated with common law concepts seems more effective in order to reduce the judicial discretion it so freely provides. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>Overall, scholars propose alternative meanings which do provide relief to some extent, but the definition remains confusing. Nonetheless, intuitive decision making cannot mould itself into modern society with Birks himself stating conscience can never be \u2018perfectly autonomous\u2019. The inherent subjectivity and private law reasoning attached to conscience is vital in the progression of law. Should we adopt a narrower approach, the courts may be too restrictive. Thus, with appropriate measures put in place, the subjectivity conscience demands can provide suitable solutions and generate greater relief, doing a great deal for its role within equity law.", "positive": "<addr2_FN>,<nl><nl>Yes I\u2019ll be making an appointment in the next week to discuss the foundation fortnight assessment.

{"anchor": "Background<nl><nl>Specsavers, founded in 1984 by Doug and Mary Perkins, is the world\u2019s largest privately-owned optical group, (Corporate Eyecare - about us | Specsavers UK, 2020) with 1,845 stores operating in 10 countries. (Experience Specsavers - Working at Specsavers - Specsavers People, 2020) Specsavers operates on a joint venture partnership, with each store owned and operated by local partners, who are qualified opticians. These partners are committed to delivering the highest standard of customer service. <nl><nl>Definition of the Business Problem<nl><nl>Specsavers stores, along with any other opticians, deal with interactions on a daily basis, whether it be in-store or via telephone. However, a lot of the time, these interactions are related to minor queries such as bookingre-arrangingcancelling appointments, checking upcoming appointment details, requesting prescriptions, or checking if glasses are in stock. <nl><nl>Currently, the option to book appointments online via the store website and cancel via the email sent regarding appointment booking confirmation is available. This has lowered the number of calls and walk-ins by a significant amount however there are still a large number of individuals who are unaware of this option. Consequently, time is taken up during the day.<nl>The directors of stores are constantly seeking ways of improving customer service. To do this, they need to understand how effective technology is in providing individuals with more freedom and the access to information from any location without having to visit or call a store. The research findings will be used to review and improve the technology.<nl><nl>Research Objectives<nl>The key question this research should answer therefore is:<nl>\u2022 How would the launch of an app benefit or worsen customers experiences and overall interactions with Specsavers?<nl><nl>Target Population<nl><nl>The target profile identified is as follows:<nl>\u2022 Customers who own a smartphone device<nl>\u2022 Customers who visit Specsavers<nl>\u2022 \u2018Direct Debit\u2019 scheme patients<nl>\u2022 Individuals who wear glasses andor contact lenses<nl>Research Design and Strategy<nl><nl>Based on the research objectives, it is recommended that a quantitative research design is implemented through the use of online questionnaires. Questionnaires are a \"set of questions designed to produce the data needed in order to meet the research objectives\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). The aim of this research is: \"To gain an insight into individuals\u2019 preferences as to whether or not they believe they would benefit from the launch of an app.\" The questionnaire will consist of various questions where the participant will rate their opinion using a Likert scale: \"A measurement scale where the respondent indicates a level of agreement or disagreement to the given statements\u2026\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). An example of the questionnaire is shown by appendix 1.<nl><nl>This method is most favourable as the sample population is large. Other survey methods such as telephone interviews or face-to-face interviews are time consuming as they require an individual (usually an experienced interviewer) to contact the participant and have a conversation with them. Therefore, for this research it is impractical. It is advised having a sample size of n=400, however, having a read of n=80 or above for each subgroup will allow to draw strong conclusions. The advantage is that it will be easier to analyse results amongst the subgroups specified in the target population. Quantitative methods aim for conclusiveness and generalisability. Therefore, once there is solid evidence to support the question, no further testing is required.<nl><nl>Sampling Approach<nl><nl>The most appropriate sampling technique is cluster sampling. This technique is part of \"probability sampling where the population is divided into groups\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018) and then randomly sampled from each group. This is the preferred method as it allows to select an equal number of participants per group, allowing for fairness and reliability. Cluster sampling involves gathering the entire population of the study and dividing them into clusters. Each cluster is a representation of the entire population. Once the clusters have been identified, certain clusters will be chosen using simple random sampling. Only the participants who meet one or more of the \u2018Target Population\" criteria will be used for the study. The unchosen clusters (those who do not meet the criteria) will remain unrepresented in the study. For this study, participants will be grouped by age, and then participants will be chosen randomly to be included in the data analysis. 100 participants per age group will be selected to allow fairness.  <nl><nl><nl><nl>Data Collection Method and Analysis<nl><nl>As mentioned previously, online questionnaires will be used due to the type of research being conducted and the size of the target sample population. Questionnaires will be sent out to every individual who has provided an e-mail address to Specsavers and given consent to receive the questionnaire. Online questionnaires allow the researcher to contact multiple participants at once. As a result, they have higher response rates as well as the ability to contact the hard-to-reach. Moreover, it is quick to create and allows for adaptability and personalisation of questions. There are no physical materials needed to send the questionnaire (paper, envelope etc.) so there are fewer expenses incurred. There may also be less bias as without an interviewer present, respondents are able to answer truthfully. Additionally, anonymity also encourages truthful answers.<nl><nl>Respondents will be given 4 weeks to complete the questionnaire from the date of visit to the store. Once completed, the results will be put onto a spreadsheet categorised by age (groups of 10 years). Once all 400 responses have been recorded, it will be analysed by calculating the averages of each question. This will help identify what customers prefer or not. For example, an average score of 1-3 shows customers disagree with the statements, 4 shows they are neutral, and a score between 5-7 means they agree. The ratings will give a good indication on whether it is beneficial to launch the app, and what features should be included.<nl><nl>A timings and costings table has been provided in the appendix (appendix 2) to highlight a more detailed overview of the length of the research project (3 months) and the total cost of the research project (\u00a328,000). <nl><nl>Ethical Issues<nl><nl>There are many ethical principles regarding the use of online surveys, the most important one being informed consent \u2013 participants within reason know what they are going to be doing. In addition, participation should be voluntary and anonymous. Questions should also avoid physical and psychological harm to the participants. All measures have been taken to ensure ethical principles have been followed. For example, informed consent will happen when customers arrive for their appointment. They will be asked whether they would like to partake in an online survey. If answered yes, only then will an e-mail containing the survey be sent.", "positive": "<addr5_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for your email and very detailed feedback.

{"anchor": "Subsequent to losing the 1983 election on a hardline socialist programme, it became clear that a rebranding of the Labour Party was crucial. The term \"New Labour\" was initially coined by Tony Blair at the 1994 Labour Party Conference, inspired by sociologist Anthony Giddens who believed that it was important to find a \"third way\" between Thatcherism and traditional socialism. The question in hand explores the way in which the Labour Party\u2019s place on the political spectrum has changed through the complexities of several policies introduced over the years. In this essay, I will be assessing the extent to which the Labour Party has been redefined from the Blair-era over two decades ago, to Corbynism today. It is worthwhile dealing with the topic at hand as politics is a subject which needs to be continuously adapting to reflect changes in global dynamics, this topic in particular reveals how government policies develop to maintain dialogue and preserve stability in an increasingly fragile and threatened geopolitical system.<nl><nl>Blair\u2019s creation of New Labour attempted to formulate an alternative to traditional social democracy and free-market neo-liberalism in the context of a modern globalised economy. This neo-revisionism advocated a balance of rights and responsibilities, resulting in communitarian liberalism which emphasised that personal autonomy operates within a communal context based on mutual dependence and benefit. As Brown\u2019s government ensured no radical breakaway from New Labour, ideals and principles of the Labour Party remained the same for many years. However, it is important to note that the Labour government\u2019s failures in the early 21st century appear to have fundamentally changed voters\u2019 views on whether Labour can be trusted on the economy, leading to a Conservative victory in the 2010 general election. This is largely significant as throughout the recent years, the Labour Party seems to have adopted more socialist principles, evident in Corbyn\u2019s left-wing agenda. Therefore, I aim to argue that the Labour party has evolved to a large extent over the years due to many successes and failures of the party leaders\u2019 policies.<nl><nl>In this essay I have used a range of books, websites and JSTOR journals. Previously published academic works include New Labour Hard Labour? Restructuring and resistance in the welfare industry by Gerry Mooney and Alex Law, as well as books such as Leadership and the Labour Party by John Gaffney. In these sources, the key concepts are focussing on New Labours\u2019 appeal to the masses and rebranding of the party. These journals and books gave clear statistics taking an innovative approach as well as differing opinions on the main policies which redefined the Labour Party which provided useful insight and information. To gain better understanding of the authors to ensure reliability of my resources I also did some prior research on them. There were many crossovers to other academic disciplines such as economics and history, especially when researching Blair and Brown\u2019s economic policies there were many statistics and economic theory. However, there were also weaknesses in the sources I used such as the author\u2019s personal opinion being a large influence.<nl><nl>After four general election defeats, the Labour Party realised that traditional class-based political ideas and concepts were no longer seen as acceptable by the British electorate. As a result, the New Labour governments aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations, by conserving resources before investing more in key public services. Blair modernised the Labour party to appeal more to middle-class voters by moving away from traditional policies such as nationalisation and emphasising constitutional reform. \u2018Clause IV\u2019 of the party constitution was abandoned, ties with trade unions were loosened and the party moved away from its previously hard-left position. Labour also became more pro-European as the EU adopted policies that protected workers\u2019 rights such as the Social Chapter, and the Third way brought market models to some government-run services and aroused interest across the western world. Labour policies were largely based around the free-market, which was accepted as the best form of wealth creation with further privatisation and reduced corporate taxes to encourage enterprise. Greater emphasis was placed on individualism and communitarianism with the belief that the individual should realise their own potential and that everyone has a responsibility to care for the community collectively. Moreover, \"as part of its wider reform of the welfare and modernisation agendas, New Labour [had] sought to emphasise the role and responsibilities of family and community in the provision of welfare services\" (Mooney, 2007). Here it is evident that the sole focus of neo-revisionism was essentially a Labour rebranding exercise to appeal to the masses and attract business interests following four consecutive UK general election defeats, it introduced important measures that promoted social justice and improved the position of the most disadvantaged in society. The government had aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations and had done so very well.<nl><nl>This rebranded party proved to be largely successful for the first few years and the idea of the \"Third way\" appealed largely to the masses, however over time, Blair\u2019s popularity began to decline. Although the Conservatives lost the 2001 election, they persisted in arguing that New Labour wasn\u2019t delivering its policy promises. This began to prove effective as there was a significant fall in the number of people who expected service delivery to either get better or much better over the next few years as \"healthcare by September 2003 8 per cent fewer people expected the NHS to \u2018get better\u2019 over the following year. At the same time, the government\u2019s satisfaction ratings fell sharply from a 54 per cent in September 2001, to 36 per cent in September 2002 and 25 per cent in September 2003\" (Hindmoor, 2005). There are many reasons as to why this happened, the main being the tragedy of Iraq which ensnared him so completely that by Summer of 2007 he had acknowledged he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. It is believed that \"Iraq [had] come to dominate the Blair legacy to such an extent that many of his notable achievements \u2013 the Good Friday agreement, devolution to Scotland and Wales, the minimum wage and a number of social reforms are doomed to shelter under its shadow\" (BBC News, 2019). As a combined result of the\u00a0Blair\u2013Brown pact, Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour Party for\u00a0Blair\u00a0to resign and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election.<nl><nl>The Financial crisis and recession of 2008-09 led to a minor shift in policy by the Brown government but still maintained a majority of the New Labour values and principles. Gordon Brown had primacy over vast areas of domestic policy and handled the banking collapse, as the unpopularity of the Iraq war had meant that a new focus was needed for the party. In its foreign policy choices, the Brown government was quite similar to that of Tony Blair\u2019s as it \"displayed the same unshakeable Atlanticism, pronounced Euroscepticism, and commitment to increasing international aid to 0.7% of gross national income as its coalition successor\" (Lee, 2019). In both health and education, \"Brown continued the Blair governments\u2019 pattern of top-down reorganisation of hospitals and schools, and the increasing use of private sector finance and organisations to deliver services\" (Lee, 2019). He supported increased spending on hospitals, pledged to make reform of the NHS a major priority and also promised to retain the public-sector reforms implemented by Blair. In domestic policy terms, the impact of devolution meant that the Brown government\u2019s capacity to reform public services was confined to England, where Brown had no personal democratic mandate to intervene.<nl><nl>Although, Brown retained a vast majority of Blair\u2019s policies, he set out plans to decentralise Britain and make good the more evident weaknesses of Blairism, not least its careless disregard for civil liberties. However, two developments quickly derailed the new prime minister\u2019s hopes. In \"August 2007 the first cracks appeared in the international banking system, cracks that would lead to the run on the Northern Rock bank the first run on a bank in Britain for 150 years \u2013 and its eventual nationalisation by New Labour \u2013 an irony after years of pro-business rhetoric\" (White, 2019). After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a recession in 2008 leading to poor results in the\u00a0local\u00a0and European elections in 2009. Brown had broken an earlier promise not to raise income tax levels by creating a new 50% band, to be paid by those who earned more than \u00a3150,000 a year which led to claims that New Labour ideology had been abandoned. <nl><nl>Despite a Conservative rule, Ed Miliband struggled to balance his more left-wing views with a desire to appeal to the centre ground. Under his leadership the Labour Party maintained some elements of New Labour policies, while shifting slightly to the left. The new leader called for the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax and the need to re-establish Labour\u2019s reputation as a competent manager of the economy was an important concern for Miliband. He tried to combine New Labour\u2019s support for business with the defence of the party\u2019s core working-class constituency by drawing a distinction between what he called \u2018predatory\u2019 and \u2018responsible capitalism. At the 2015 election Miliband pledged to reduce the deficit every year of the next parliament. He insisted that Labour\u2019s spending plans would be paid for without additional borrowing. \"Miliband [pledged] to fund the NHS improvements with a mansion tax on properties worth over \u00a32m. other tax pledges include the restoration of the 10p tax band for low earners\" (The Independent, 2019). However, by 2015 there was pressure from the left of the party for Labour to adopt a much more radical approach. Some party member attributed the landslide victory of the SNP in Scotland, where Labour was left with just one Westminster seat, to the party being insufficiently left wing.<nl><nl>\"Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two\" (BBC News, 2019). Jeremy Corbyn sinisterly told photographers and journalists \"under Socialism you will all cooperate\" (Express.co.uk, 2019) suggesting a radical shift to the left. He took the Miliband-balls idea of increased investment in the economy further, calling for large-scale funding of industry and infrastructure organised by a National Investment Bank. He called for the renationalisation of the railways, a policy the New Labour governments refused to adopt. Instinctively supporting intervention of an Old Labour kind, he demanded that companies publish pay audits with the aim of countering discrimination in the workplace. \"Labour has pledged to rejuvenate the UK's neglected high streets, nationalize public services and some major industries, and force all large firms to give their employees a share of the business and a voice on their boards. Critics of Labour say these policies are throwbacks to failed socialist governments of the 1970s\" (Vonberg, 2019). Like Miliband, he favoured the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax. However, Corbyn was much more clear-cut in his competition to austerity, characterising it as a political choice that harmed the most vulnerable members of society, rather than an economic necessity. Many bold claims have been made about Corbyn with \"Corbyn may not be a Communist, but he\u2019s certainly a Marxist\" (The Northern Echo, 2019) being one of the boldest. Corbyn strongly opposed benefit cuts and a socialist he regarded the poor as the victims of capitalism, who are entitled to public support. He opposed the use of the private sector to deliver public services \u2013 a central aspect of New Labour. Thus, he argued for a wholly state-run NHS. In order to promote lifelong education and training, he called for a national education service, and opposed student tuition fees. By contrast, Ed Miliband had confined himself to advocating their reduction from \u00a39,000 to \u00a36,000 a year. In terms of law and order policy, Corbyn was opposed to the more hard-line policies of the New Labour era, such as increased powers to combat terrorism and the introduction of identity cards. This became a less controversial policy area within the labour party \u2013 both Blairites and Corbynites found common ground in opposing government cuts to police number. Corbyn consistently voted against the use of force and favoured the withdrawal of the UK from NATO\u2019s military structure and the abolition of the Trident nuclear weapons system, again placing him at odds with New Labour. `He followed the mainstream of his party in supporting continued British membership of the EU, emphasising its positive role in protecting workers\u2019 rights.<nl><nl>In conclusion, it is evident that the Labour Party had been redefined to a large extent, beginning as a more centrist party in 1997 and eventually becoming a more radical socialist party in present day. Through several policy failures, the Labour Party established that it needed to rebrand itself once again to adapt to current affairs. It is evident that Gordon Brown maintained a large amount of the New Labour principles however, Ed Miliband realised that this new and reformed party wasn\u2019t going to get them through the 2015 election. This resulted in more left-wing agendas being proposed and the Labour Party promoting themselves as a more socialist organisation. Thus, to conclude, the Labour Party has been redefined to a large extent with several shifts throughout the political spectrum over the years.", "positive": "dule_code> and the exam was on the <DDth> of <month> I think. <module>.<new>Thank you for your help<new>Hi, <nl><nl>I moved out of my accommodation a few days after university closed and wasn\u2019t able to return my key as there was relatively little people on campus and wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the site without my key.

{"anchor": "<question1><nl><nl>The period of adolescence is a time where behaviour is characterised by impulsivity, increased risk taking and an affinity for peer groups (Spear, 2010). During no other period in the lifespan is the prevalence of death so high relative to health, with Steinberg (2013) reporting a dramatic spike in self-inflicted behaviours such as car accidents and crime. Adolescent behaviour and the reasons for its occurrence has posed a particular question for researchers. <nl><nl>The duel systems process model proposes that adolescent typical behaviour is caused by a developmental imbalance between the subcortical socioemotional system implicated in sensitivity to rewards and novelty, relative to the cognitive control system responsible for impulse and emotional control as well as decision making (Shulman et al, 2016). The model hypothesises that the early activation and maturation of the ventral striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) in early adolescence increases one\u2019s propensity for sensation seeking whilst the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is still maturing, therefore attenuating impulse control (Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2011). It is predicted that sensation seeking behaviour increases at the early stages of adolescence and levels off as adulthood is reached, following an inverted \u2018U\u2019 shape trajectory. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob (2011) assessed this using longitudinal data from over 7000 participants aged 12-24, looking at self-reported changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking. They found that mean levels of impulsivity declined through adolescence and levelled off when participants reached their mid-20s, consistent with neurobiological research suggesting heightened activation of the ventral striatum in early to mid-adolescence relative to children and adults (Barkley-Leveson &amp; Galv\u00e1n, 2014). This supports the claim that adolescent typical behaviour is a product of nature due to the profound influence of brain structures and their relative levels of maturity on sensation seeking behaviour.  Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob\u2019s (2011) research is one of the first to report this trend using longitudinal data and to utilise such a large sample, representative of a diverse population. Furthermore, the use of such a large data set reduced the chance of type I errors. However, caution should be taken when drawing conclusions due to the risk of social desirability and response bias when using measures of self-report. <nl><nl>It has been asserted by some researchers that adolescents possess the ability to evaluate risky decisions to the same level as adults (Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006), begging the questions as to why this age group engage in risk behaviours to such a degree? Observational data suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents heightened propensity for risk (Albert et al, 2013) with researchers suggesting adaptive benefits such as increasing peer status and peer affiliation with desirable social groups (Spear, 2010). Steinberg &amp; Gardener (2005) assessed the effects of peer contexts on risky decision making in 3 age groups including adolescents (13-16), youths (18-22) and adults (24+). All 306 participants completed 3 measures of risk orientation including 2 self-report measures and a computerised driving task named the Chicken Game. In this task participants were required to make decisions about whether to advance the vehicle once a traffic light turns from green to yellow (meaning an impending red light) with the possibility of a car crash if the car advances through a red light. Participants were randomly assigned either the peer condition where they would complete the task with 2 others or the alone condition. Steinberg &amp; Gardener found that each group engaged in comparable risk taking when alone but increased risk taking when in the presence of peers, more pronounced during middle and late adolescence. This suggest adolescents\u2019 susceptibility to peer influence relative to adults when taking risk, implying the role of nurture and social contexts in adolescent typical behaviours. This study has important implications for interventions seeking to reduce risky behaviour amongst adolescence (i.e. juvenile delinquency) suggesting attention should be directed towards increasing resistance to peer influence in young people. However, this study has arguably low ecological validity as it unable to capture the complex dynamic of risk taking with peers outside of a laboratory setting.<nl><nl>In conclusion the cause of adolescent behaviour appears to be a combination of both nature and nurture influences, with research suggesting that peer influence may increase the brain\u2019s risk and reward system sensitivity (Albert et al, 2013). Subsequently, the duel process model and effects of peer stimuli may co-influence risky behaviours seen in adolescents as young people spend most of their time with peers (Spear, 2010). Therefore, the claim that adolescent behaviour reflects the influence of nature more so than nurture is not supported. <nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Research suggest adolescence is the greatest risk period for the emergence of psychopathological disorders, with mental illness affecting 1 in 5 young people (Powers &amp; Casey, 2015). In light of this, this essay shall seek to critically discuss how brain development may facilitate the high prevalence of psychopathology during adolescence.<nl><nl>Stress has been considered an important factor contributing to adolescents\u2019 vulnerability to internalising disorders, namely anxiety (Romeo, 2010). Brain areas identified as being implicated in this increased vulnerability includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which undergoes significant maturational changes and a reawakening during puberty (Spear, 2010). The HPA axis is responsible for controlling stress-induced hormonal secretion in response to stressors and does so by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation (McCormick et al.,2010). Once released, ACHT acts to increase the production and release of glucocorticoid hormones, which then act upon the brain to predetermine future responses to future stress stimuli. Using a battery of acute stressors, Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) assessed the hormonal stress response of prepubescent rats, compared to that of adult rats and found a greater, more prolonged ACHT and corticosterone response in the younger rats compared to adults. Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) suggested that it takes twice as long for these hormones to return to baseline level in premid-adolescent rats following stress stimuli relative to adult rats. Reflective of the results seen in animals, researchers have speculated that anxious individuals may show a delayed HPA axis recovery following a stressor, which in turn may make them slower to adjust to novelty, giving rise to psychopathological vulnerabilities (Spear, 2010). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results to human behaviour because of the use of animal data. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess levels of glucocorticoid in human adolescents because of the natural diurnal release rhythm it follows (Spear, 2010), meaning animal studies have provided a valuable opportunity to investigate this, whilst having strong experimental control. Furthermore, animal research is able to bypass the ethical implications to be considered when conducting human research (Eiland &amp; Romeo, 2013). <nl><nl>Attention deficithyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be defined as inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity relative to an individual\u2019s age, that interferes with their functioning (Shaw et al., 2012). Onset of ADHD is around 7 years (occurring before puberty) and is prevalent in over 5% of children worldwide (Friedman &amp; Rapoport, 2015). Research has suggested that brain development through late childhood and adolescence is an important factor contributing to ADHD. Shaw et al (2007) assessed this using a longitudinal MRI scan study of 223 ADHD diagnosed participants matched with 223 typically developing (TD) controls.  Shaw and colleagues found a marked delay in ADHD in achieving peak cortical thickness throughout the cerebrum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). This delay was most pronounced in the middle and lateral PFC, implicated in higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and planning, where peak thickness was achieved 5 years later than TD controls. In addition to this it was seen that the primary motor cortex conversely showed early maturation in ADHD (peaking age 7 years), when compared to controls (peaking age 7.4 years). Shaw and colleagues speculated that the delayed developmental trajectory of regions implicated in higher-order motor control, paired with the early maturation of the primary motor cortex may account for symptoms seen in ADHD i.e. poor motor control. This influential study was seen to be the first longitudinal neuroanatomic research evidencing the theory of delayed cortical maturation in ADHD, due to the advanced in MRI techniques seen in recent history. However, it should be noted that the results cannot endorse differences in intelligence and sexual dimorphisms seen in ADHD, despite their effect on cortical development because they strictly controlled for in the design. <nl><nl>To conclude brain maturation and development in adolescents, relative to adults seems to have implications for various psychopathologies. Spear (2010) suggests for disorders like ADHD where onset occurs just prior to adolescence, motor control regions may show developmental anomalies, whereas disorders with adolescent aged onset i.e. anxiety, show developmental differences in the frontal regions. It can be speculated that the PFC\u2019s immaturity in adolescents relative to adults, may be sensitive to the reawakening and prolonged effects of the HPA axis. However, brain development is not the only factor giving rise to psychopathologies in adolescents with mental health varying by person. Instead some researchers propose the stress-diathesis model, suggesting an interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental stresses, predisposing certain individuals to psychopathologies during adolescence (Spear, 2010).", "positive": "In-line with your requests for the the trip, you will be staying in the Radison Blu Royal in Kamppi from the 2nd-4th Sept.

{"anchor": "1. Compare and contrast deductive and inductive reasoning. Use examples to explain. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning involves logical thinking, providing us with the means to determine valid arguments in one\u2019s train of thought. Similarly, inductive reasoning is a way of increasing semantic information through generalisation, allowing us to come to conclusions about whether a statement is true or false. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning is similar to inductive reasoning in that concrete or previously known knowledge affects performance on experimental tasks measuring components of ordinary language. For example, in deductive reasoning, our own beliefs effect the validity of conclusions we make because our world knowledge clouds our judgement. Wilkins, (1928) found participants\u2019 beliefs caused conflict with the validity of syllogisms and as a result, their judgement was poorer. Beliefs effect the interpretation of premises, influencing reasoning and bringing about response bias, therefore affecting the validity of the conclusion made. Similarly, experiments on inductive reasoning show familiar content can remind a person of similar problems they solved in the past. Griggs &amp; Cox, (1982) called this the \u2018Memory Cueing Hypothesis\u2019 \u2013 individuals retrieve similar contexts or situations involving solving a similar problem from their long-term memory, reducing facilitation effects involved in reasoning. <nl><nl>Another distinction between these types of reasoning is the certainty involved in making conclusions. In inductive reasoning, there is no certainty that the conclusion made from premises are valid all the time, as validity of conclusions depends on factors such as premises given, intention of the argument or statement, as well as the amount of information available at the time. Contrastingly, deductive reasoning is not dependent on as many variables, and is much more clear-cut and direct. Deductive reasoning allows us to form completely valid conclusions all the time, due to logical systems this type of reasoning follows, such as formulisation. Therefore, the conclusion will follow from the premises with absolute certainty, unlike inductive reasoning.<nl><nl>2. Why do we find Wason\u2019s selection task so difficult? <nl>Peter Wason\u2019s selection task is a logic puzzle involving deductive reasoning, heavily influenced by Popper\u2019s hypotheticodeductive method. Participants are presented with four cards and a simple rule, and are asked which cards they need to turn over to see if the rule has been broken. Performance in this task is only 15%, even if participants are asked to falsify the rule, not prove it right. Research suggests concrete content facilitates performance. Cheng &amp; Holyoak (1985) state that humans reason with context-dependent \u2018pragmatic reasoning schemas\u2019, involving knowledge about permissions, obligations and causations. These schemas function to predict and reason in unfamiliar situations. During the selection task, permission schemas are evoked along with a set of rules with familiar information in a given scenario. The corresponding schema matches information required to solve the task, and so permission schema facilitate performance, especially when concrete rather than abstract content is used. <nl><nl>Additionally, Wason\u2019s selection task is found difficult when rules cannot be interpreted as a social contract. Cosmides, (1989) found the selection task is facilitated when involving social exchanges derived from his computational theory, specifically tasks requiring the participant to detect a \u2018cheater\u2019 trying to take the benefit without paying the cost of a contract. In the context of the selection task, the participant is detecting a \u2018if P not Q\u2019 card is exposing the cheat. Cheat detection is parallel with familiar realistic situations involving social interaction rather than ambiguous and context-free content. When a selection task uses abstract terms not involving social exchanges, participants find it harder to reason as the situation is unfamiliar and doesn\u2019t entail benefits or losses. This highlights the importance of context in Wason\u2019s selection task \u2013 when context is not given, performance decreases considerably.<nl><nl>3. What are the predictions of \"Subjective Expected Utility\" theory for human decision making. How have deviations been explained? <nl><nl>Subjective expected utility theory (SEU), (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944 &amp; Savage, 1954) describes decision making, stating when individuals make decisions, they will act rationally by trying to maximise their expected utility. SEU aims to simplify decision making via 5 axioms (completeness,\u00a0transitivity,\u00a0continuity, independence and ranking), which when considered, will maximise expected utility. <nl><nl>The transitivity axiom assumes people make choices transitively \u2013 if they prefer A to B and B to C, they should prefer A to C. Tversky, (1969) identified a deviation in this axiom, called \u2018intransitivity of preferences\u2019, stating that humans are, in reality, inconsistent in their preferences of choices due to individual differences in evaluative processes and because preferences vary temporally. Tversky conducted experiments using classic transitive preference scenarios and found participants\u2019 preference ordering was inconsistent to the transitivity axiom. Classic scenarios are not logically compatible with the rationality of human decision making, because variability and individuality of decision making in realistic situations aren\u2019t taken into consideration.<nl><nl>The independence axiom states preference of order between two choices with equal outcomes should not be affected by one another, even when a third gamble is involved. In other words, equal outcomes should cancel each-other out. A deviation in this axiom called the \u2018Allais paradox\u2019 (Allais, 1953), states the independence axiom fails to consider feelings like disappointment, as well as the rationality involved in choosing a gamble and potentially getting nothing from it. The Allais paradox states evaluations of gambles cannot be done independently of other gambles, as the independence axiom assumes. <nl><nl>These deviations highlight the importance for a newer theory to recognise the influence of rationality, and which involves a psychologically descriptive approach, for example the \u2018multi-attribute utility theory\u2019 which is more able to explain decision making in realistic scenarios where decisions are dependent on many independent variables.<nl><nl>4. Using a specific puzzle or problem of your own choice, write out a plan (including diagram) of how to solve it using a state-action tree. <nl><nl>This problem is the \u2018Chicken River Crossing Puzzle\u2019: A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. The task is to find out how the man gets all 3 things to the other side of the river in one piece. <nl><nl>The solution to this puzzle is as follows: first, the chicken crosses the river in the boat, and the fox and corn are safe together on the other side. He goes back across, and then takes the fox across the river replacing it with the chicken, which is now on the other side. Since the chicken and corn cannot be left together, he takes the corn in his boat and switches the chicken for the corn, which he takes across and leaves it with the fox. He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time, where all his items are across the river safely.<nl><figure><nl><nl>5. What is \"creativity\" and how can it be assessed?  <nl><nl>Creativity is defined as one\u2019s ability to generate innovative ideas and solutions, and is seen as a form of intelligence. Creative solutions are seen as valuable and insightful, often solutions that novice individuals may not have come up with themselves; in this regard, creative individuals are seen as experts in their domain, as they hold extensive knowledge giving them the ability to produce innovative and original solutions commonly acknowledged by wider society. <nl><nl>Various perspectives aim to assess creativity differently, for example the psychometric approach aims to objectively measure creativity. Creativity has been conceptualised as a form of divergent thinking by Guilford, (1956), which is a style of thinking that can lead to many possible solutions to the same problem. It requires both originality and flexibility. Psychometric tests of creativity include the \u2018Unusual Uses Task\u2019 by Guilford, (1967): the participant\u2019s task is to create alternative uses for a common object. Four dimensions are used to score answers: flexibility, originality, fluency, elaboration. Participant\u2019s demonstrate divergent thinking if they generate unusual yet valuable uses for the object. The \u2018Remote Associates Test\u2019 (RAT) was created by Mednick, (1962), who theorised that creativity involves associating nonidentical concepts which are considered dissimilar. In RATs, respondents are shown stimuli in the form of three words and are asked to identify a word to link them together, for example \"worm  shelf  end\". Here, the answer is book (book worm, book shelf, book end). Psychometric tests in assessing creativity have produced interesting results, especially the observed link between creativity and intelligence, however these methods often mix creativity and intelligence, or originality and creativity. That is, creative individuals tend to have high IQ, but not all high IQ individuals are creative, consequently decreasing the validity of psychometric tests claiming to assess creativity.", "positive": " degree in <subject><new><subject> is dea <new>d<new>All about <subject>\ud83d\ude0f<new>Wet ate upi <new>Wya??<new>are you even drunk <new>ffs<new>rah <new>Try go on now<new>Naaahhh<new>it\u2019s not<new>wo<new>Idk I hat to do<new>Morning <addr2_FN><new>yh was rough lmaoo I\u2019m okay now tho<new>she\u2019s okay tho <new>No one wants help when tryna be sick <new>Okay good<new>lol <new>Poor <pers_FN><new>lmao the effects <new>Lmao they\u2019re right <new>Let's (House)party.<new>no do it no<new>A<new>W<new>whilst everyone\u2019s on <new>ew<new>omg it looks so empty <new>I\u2019ve still gotta move out <new>oh hair <new>shit<new>Who was it<new>Was she blonde <new>Yh is our neighout <new>How much was he slamming it ", "attacked": "degree in <subject><new><subject> is dea <new>d<new>All about <subject>\ud83d\ude0f<new>Wet ate upi <new>Wya??<new>are you even drunk <new>ffs<new>rah <new>Try go on now<fresh>Naaahhh<new>it\u2019s not<new>wo<new>Idk I hat to do<new>Morning <addr2_FN><new>yh was rough lmaoo I\u2019m okay now tho<new>she\u2019s o.k. tho <new>No one wants help when tryna be sick <new>Okay good<new>lol <new>Poor <pers_FN><new>lmao the effects <new>Lmao they\u2019re right <new>Let's (House)party.<new>no do it no<new>A<unexampled>W<new>whilst everyone\u2019s on <new>ew<new>omg it looks so empty <new>I\u2019ve still gotta incite out <new>oh hair <new>shit<new>Who was it<new>Was she blonde <new>Yh is our neighout <new>How much was he thrash it", "attack_type": "synonym_replacement", "replacement_rate": 0.15, "stats": {"n_original_words": 85, "n_attacked_words": 85, "n_changed": 5, "change_rate": 0.0588}}

{"anchor": "The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport\u2019s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities\u00a0for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA\u2019s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as \u2018dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority\u2019. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the \u2018spirit of sport\u2019 which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong\u2019s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures \u2018clean athletes don\u2019t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments\u2019. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete\u2019s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA\u2019s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete\u2019s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS\u2019 shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was \u2018\u2026 the most detrimental aspect of the Code\u2019.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a \u2018level playing field\u2019<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various\u00a0settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in \u2018sophisticated doping\u2019 in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds\u00a0these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are \u2018unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated\u2019. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated\u00a0doping\u00a0practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised,\u00a0more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya\u2019s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this\u00a0inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should\u00a0be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that \u2018at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach\u2019. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was \u2018a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.\u2019<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies\u2019 ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being \u2018neutral athletes\u2019 provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay\u00a0argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is\u00a0a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for\u00a0children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA\u2019s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", "positive": "<nl><nl>10:30 is fine!<nl><nl>Thanks,<nl><part_FN>.<new>Hi,<nl><nl>It's understandable.

{"anchor": "Abstract<nl>Partial replication of Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) cued visual attention task, where participants were cued, and then attended to a stimulus shown on either the right or left hemifield. 75% of the trials were congruent, in which participants were cued to the same side as the stimulus was presented, and 25% were incongruent. Alpha activity at the left parietal lobe (P3) was higher 200ms before stimulus onset when the stimulus was cued to the left compared to the right. This supports Klimesch\u2019s (2007) alpha inhibition hypothesis, stating that high alpha activity indicates inhibition in task-irrelevant brain regions. This finding paves way to further research on the implications of alpha activity and its relation to anticipatory attention. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha oscillations (8-13Hz) have an inhibitory function and are involved in attentional selection and suppression (Klimesch, 2012). The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007) highlights that high alpha activity indicates inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. Alpha activity is modulated by attention, as when stimuli are presented on a screen, contralateral brain areas are activated and ipsilateral are inhibited (task irrelevant).<nl>Mazahari et al.\u2019s (2014) cued flanker task involved typically developing (TD), combined subtype, and inattentive ADHD participants. Null or response preparation (RP) cues preceded each trial, with an 84% accuracy of the correct direction to attend. The AIH was demonstrated as TD adolescents showed the greatest alpha suppression following the RP cues, with inattentive ADHD subtypes showing the least, due to their difficulty responding to environmental cues. Greatest alpha suppression was detected directly after cue onset for the TD group, with no group difference in alpha suppression following a null cue, suggesting that RP cues influence the lateralisation of processing.<nl>Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) cued visual attention task involved a central arrow indicating which hemifield, a 50% chance of being cued left or right, the participants should attend to. The target stimulus was then presented, and participants were asked whether the bar was small or large (50% chance of each). Congruent trials included an instructional cue which was consistent with the location of the bar (75% of trials), and 25% of trials incongruent.<nl>Congruent trials showed stronger alpha suppression on sides contralateral to the hemifield where the stimuli were processed, derived from EEG recordings of the parietal, frontal, and fronto-medial regions, further supporting the AIH. Incongruent trials had an opposite effect due to incorrect anticipation of the stimulus. Fronto-medial and parietal regions demonstrated phase coupling between the RP cue and stimulus onset, and post-stimulus (200-600ms). <nl>Previous research shows alpha activity increases on the contralateral side to the stimuli attended, being most prominent in parietal and occipital regions before stimulus onset. The current study partially replicates Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) cued visual attention task, hypothesising an increased alpha activity in the left parietal lobe (P3) when stimuli are presented on the left hemifield compared to the right, before target stimuli are presented for congruent trials.  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 psychology undergraduate students were selected via opportunity sampling, but one participant\u2019s data was excluded as data was only available for one condition of the experiment.<nl><nl>Design<nl>A repeated measures design consisted of the independent variable (cue location) with two levels: left or right hemifield, and the dependent variable (the alpha amplitudes of the P3 electrode in \ud835\udf07V (microvolts)). <nl><nl>Materials<tab><nl>The active EEG electrode was used to record alpha activity, the reference electrode provided a comparison and the earth electrode reduced interference, all connected to Biopac MP36 for data collection. Everi cream removed dead skin from the scalp, and AC cream adhered the electrode to the scalp, improving conductivity. Psychopy presented stimuli and sent event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. The stimuli were two arrow cues (&lt; and &gt;), and two bars (Figure 1).<nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Alpha band oscillations (8\u201313Hz) were identified in the raw EEG data recorded (0.5-35Hz) with a sampling rate of 1000Hz. The 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Technologies, 2012) was employed, wherein the active electrode was attached to P3, reference to Fz, and earth to the forehead near the hairline. An impedance reading &lt;10k\u03a9 was required prior to data collection, after which eligible participants were provided the right to withdraw and informed consent retrieved.<nl>Participants engaged in a practice trial, which began with instructions stating a cue would appear on the screen informing them which side to anticipate a stimulus, followed by a brief pause and either a small or large bar appearing on the appropriate side of the screen. Participants were then instructed to press \u2018L\u2019 if a large or \u2018S\u2019 if a small bar appeared on the screen. The cue (&lt; or &gt;) was displayed for 35ms, followed by a fixation cross to recapture participants\u2019 attention to the centre of the screen, and then a small or large bar appearing on the specific hemifield for 50ms. Feedback was provided after each trial, with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 800ms and 12 trials in total in the practice run. The practice run involved 4 trial types (arrow right to either small or large bar, and arrow left to either small or large bar) each repeating 3 times. The practice run involved only congruent trials; arrows pointed to the hemifield where the stimulus was presented.<nl>After completing the practice trials, participants were introduced to the experimental trials and recording of EEG alpha activity commenced. Experimental trials differed as no feedback was provided after trials, the ISI was between 200-1200ms, 25% of the trials were incongruent (stimulus was presented in the opposite side that the cue pointed to) and 75% congruent. Event markers were sent at stimulus onset, and each trial type was repeated 20 times in a randomised order (80 trials in total), wherein 50% of trials cued left and 50% right.<nl>Upon completion, the electrodes were removed, gel cleaned from the scalp and participants were debriefed.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>Event markers were used to identify stimulus onset. Alpha activity was investigated after display of arrow cues and 200ms before stimulus onset.  The data was rectified to convert negative values into positive, showing the average signal strength (\ud835\udf07V) compared to the range, regardless of activity being inhibitory or excitatory. Data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the effects of outliers. Rectification and integration ensured that accurate means were taken for each condition. These rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for further analysis. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied as the normality of data assumption for Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test was violated (p &lt; .05).<nl>Table 1. <nl>Median and interquartile ranges for alpha amplitudes in left parietal lobe in cued left and cued right conditions (n=38).<nl><nl><table><nl><nl>Table 1. shows median RAAA in P3 was greater in the cue left compared to cue right condition 200ms before stimulus onset, and a Wilcoxon signed rank test shows this difference was significant (W=566, n=38, p =.005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>200ms prior to stimulus onset, RAAA increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left compared to the right hemifield, supporting the research hypothesis. Stimuli presented on the left hemifield led to an increase in alpha activity on the left hemisphere due to inhibition as this region is task-irrelevant, and stimuli processed on the contralateral hemisphere led to increased alpha activity at P3. The findings support both the AIH and Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) findings, showing an increase in alpha activity in task-irrelevant regions prior to stimulus presentation. This is because RP cueing affects the lateralisation of processing, leading to the anticipation of stimuli appearing on the same hemifield the cue directed them to.<nl>A methodological flaw is that high impedance affects data quality as it leads to variance in the measurements and requires more trials to ensure statistical significance in analyses of P3 (Kappenman and Luck, 2010). This can be mitigated by high pass filtering and artifact rejection, along with using a cool dry recording environment.<nl>The findings of this study lend weight to Klimesch\u2019s (2007) AIH, and the influence of attention on alpha brain activity. Future research should explore specific types of attention e.g., anticipatory and temporal, and their influence on alpha activity.", "positive": " mum do know anything about <medication> ?

{"anchor": "Dear CEO, With regards to your upcoming conference in Helsinki from the 2nd to 4th September, I have researched and identified the relevant itinerary items for your trip. - I have identified two potential accommodations within the \u00a3200 per night budget: 1. Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for \u00a3308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for \u00a3250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra \u00a316 per night (totalling \u00a3342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay. If you could please review my recommendations and let me know if you think they are appropriate so that I can pass them onto the travel department to do the booking.

{"anchor": "This essay will focus on how well FIFA have responded to the 2015 corruption scandal and an in-depth look into the measures they have since taken to prevent bribery being used within FIFA. By looking at different views and academic disciplines to critically evaluate if FIFA have done enough to prevent corruption and bribery continuing within their organisation.<nl><nl>Background:<nl>FIFA, an organisation people all over the world are familiar with. In 2002 213 countries broadcast the FIFA world cup making it the most watched event in television history. The reach and influence FIFA has is vast. FIFA is a non-profit organisation which describes itself as the international governing body of association football. FIFA was established in 1904 by 7 different nations. The global network and sensation surrounding FIFA Led them to generating $4.6 billion in 2018.<nl>In 2015 an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) lead to 14 people being indicted surrounding widespread allegations of corruption, wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering within FIFA. There were allegations that $115 million in bribes were handed over to FIFA officials for several reasons. This case caused several arrests to be made in different countries across the world such as Australia, Columbia, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Germany. This case has been ongoing for several years and allegations of corruption within FIFA have been circulating for many more. In 2002 a FIFA whistle-blower contacted a British journalist with allegations of corruption within FIFA. Later there was a book written by the same journalist (Andrew Jennings) documentary about the corruption and the World Cup this led to the FBI contacting Jennings. Since then more and more information from investigators and whistle-blowers has come to light about bribes and corruption going on within FIFA mainly regarding World Cup\u2019s and where they will be held. Countries were bribing FIFA officials to accept their bid for the World Cup to be held in their country. The investigation has found out that there was bribery involved in Qatar\u2019s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup.<nl>In December 2014 FIFA had conducted their own investigation into the allegations of corruption however they did not release the findings of this investigation but just an executive summary. In which they claimed to have exonerated the bidding process of corruption. This decision shows that in 2014 they were not willing to make any major changes or take responsibility for the corruption and bribery that took place. These actions could show FIFAs unwillingness to change these practices and shows in the future it will still be standard practice for FIFA to take bribes.<nl><nl>2022 World Cup:<nl>There are many arguments surrounding the FIFA scandal some people argue that Qatar should not be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup as it effectively rewards their actions and involvement in the corruption. There are arguments that it would be inappropriate to allow a controversial state to host the World Cup and have such a large platform. The fact that this corruption harms so many people it breaches the ethics of virtues.  There are already red flags being raised about the 2022 World Cup and the fact that for the first time in its history it will be held in the winter due to the temperatures in the summer in the middle east. Anti-corruption expert Sylvia Schenk believes that if there was a legal dispute regarding this it would not be resolved until at least 2028 at which point it is ineffective. <nl>Between the scandal in 2015 and the World Cup that is due to take place in 2022 there have been many years and many different chances for FIFA officials to set a precedent and show that they are committed to stamping the corruption out of FIFA. One way to achieve this would be to allow another country to host the 2022 World Cup. It has been argued that this would not be too difficult as many countries have the infrastructure e.g., stadiums set up to accommodate the World Cup therefore logistics should not be an issue here. This shows that FIFA do not appear to have taken anything away from the scandal and try and change for the better.<nl><nl>Human Rights:<nl>The issues regarding the 2015 scandal are still Widely debated 2021. With Qualifying stages of the 2022 World Cup starting players have been protesting the allegations of human rights of migrant workers being breached in Qatar due to host the 2022 World Cup. The Guardian revealed in February 2021 that since Qatar won the bid to host the tournament in 2010 over 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar. However, this shocking statistic could be misleading it is impossible to know how many of these deaths are related to human rights breaches and how many are related to the World Cup. This however does not look good for FIFA or Qatar surrounding this global event especially as 37 deaths have been directly linked to the construction of the stadiums. This issue that is gaining global traction due partly to Norway who on the 24th of March protested by wearing T-shirts during the warmup which read \"human rights on and off the pitch \"in their World Cup qualifying match. Other teams have started to follow suit by wearing T-shirts raising awareness of the problem. Kimmich has argued that teams are 10 years too late to boycott. The damage has already been done and Qatar have been allowed to get away with this for far too long protests should have been taking place when Qatar was allocated the World Cup and before they started building all the stadiums. However, The German football Federation is not in favour of boycotting the World Cup. So, all the T-shirt wearing in the world will not help the migrant workers that have died or will continue to die for this World Cup or others to come. This is yet another example of a time where FIFA have sat back and let corruption run rife within its organisation six years after the corruption scandal this therefore shows they have not made major improvements or changes to stop his from happening for many more years to come.<nl><nl>Social Responsibility:<nl>It is not just a legal field that believes FIFA are problematic. It is argued that FIFA are also corrupt in terms of their corporate social responsibility. In a 2014 study it was found that corporations and companies that sponsored FIFA were disliked more and trusted less by the public and people are more likely to negatively talk about these brands with their peers. This study can be very negative for FIFA and the many brands that pay them millions in sponsorship. This could cause massive problems for FIFA in the future if corporations and brands the sponsor that events decide that they do not want to be associated any more. This is one example of how the corruption scandal has negatively impacted FIFA is brand and therefore value. Therefore, correcting and changing this public perception will be crucial to FIFAs continued success. <nl><nl>Feminist Perspective:<nl>There is also a view that FIFA is a \"boys club\". Professional tennis player Billie Jean King has tried to advocate for FIFA to hire more female managers and to appoint more females into higher roles within the company and hire someone specifically for the purpose of regulating gender equality within the company. She also raises a point that having more women within FIFA could improve the culture of corruption that exists. There have been studies that show that women are less likely to be involved in bribery and are less likely to condone bribe taking.  Data from different countries shows that corruption is less severe where women held more seats in parliament or more senior positions and comprise of a larger share of the labour force. Therefore, viewing this issue from the feminist perspective one way FIFA could counter some corruption could be to employ women in more positions and in more senior roles. However, it could be argued that this is less of a gender difference and more of a culturally based issue in however due to the global nature of FIFA this could potentially make a difference. The fact that some of these issues were raised years ago and have not been acted upon shows once again that FIFA are not dedicated to eradicating corruption.    <nl><nl>Legalities:  <nl>FIFA is registered and incorporated under swiss law. It is a very attractive base for many international organisations not only due to its location and political stability Switzerland also has most importantly a very lenient legal code and attractive tax regime. This could be one of the reasons that attracted FIFA to incorporate itself there. Switzerland is perceived to be a country that is least affected by corruption however this does not prevent organisations that are located there being involved in corruption. Article 332 of the Swiss criminal code only refers to the bribery of a public official as criminal therefore there is no criminal liability for the bribery of officials in international sports organisations such as FIFA. It could be argued that this is one of the reasons that corruption and bribery has run rampant within FIFA for so many years. It could be argued that under the Swiss federal act on unfair competition the type of bribery happening within FIFA could be criminally prosecuted. However transparency International believe that it is unclear whether this would be applicable to sport and FIFA. In 2004 the Federal Council ruled that this article did not apply to non-governmental organisations e.g. FIFA. There have been moves made by the Swiss Parliament to change the law so that Bribery that does not involve public officials can be criminally charged. This was following a recommendation from GRECO. This accountability should prevent more bribes taking place within FIFA.<nl><nl>Geography:<nl>The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates a situation where it is impossible for one country to be able to keep track and punish such a large organisation. FIFA is a billion-pound empire that effectively has the ability to punish countries this makes them untouchable. This system negatively affects smaller and poorer countries. Morocco was also competing for the 2022 World Cup and after spending millions on the campaign they lost out to Qatar due to the bribes Qatar paid to FIFA officials.  Currently 32 teams and subsequently 32 countries play in the World Cup, FIFA have been discussing pushing this to 48 countries. Bringing more countries in to the World Cup could potentially reduce corruption and bribery as that is more accountability and even more countries will be watching them. However, this could go the other way and now there are 16 more countries that could be involved in bribery. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup they denied Morocco the chance to host the World Cup. It could be argued that Morocco deserve the World Cup more as they are a smaller economy and the World Cup would have benefited them more than Qatar. It could also be argued that after the  bribery Qatar used to gain the world cup came to light Morocco should have been awarded the World Cup. There has been talks of Spain Portugal and Morocco  teaming up for a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup however Spain and Portugal signed a joint bid agreement and left Morocco out once again this could be devastating for Morocco\u2019s economy. There have been studies into GDP and corruption. Qatar\u2019s GDP is 175.8 billion c compared to Morocco\u2019s 119.7 both in 2019. The study indicates that the poorer country the more likely they are to be susceptible to corruption however in this example that does not seem to be the case as based on GDP Qatar has more wealth but clearly, they were more susceptible to bribery.  <nl><nl>Psychology:<nl>There are many Psychological theories and there has been lots of research completed in regards to bribery and corruption. One of the main theories that comes from psychological studies is the trust game. This was first created by Berg et al the results from the study were surprising and went against the standard economic theory upon which they were based. The theory and results of this study can be applied to FIFA the anonymity and scale of the bribery makes it easier for people to be corrupted as there is a level of anonymity. One problem with this theory is that the study was done in 1995 on a very small population therefore the results cannot be generalised to modern society and the global society where customs cultures and values vary massively. Studies like this one tend to be studied by white men and study white men therefore there is massive gender and racial bias involved in the results of this study which reduce the effectiveness of it outside of the context of a single study.  Similar studies were conducted that compared data from many different countries to see if there was a relationship between nationality and the likelihood to take or condone bribery.  The study found that collectivism versus individualism on a national scale was the fact and most likely to affect bribery. This theory seems to line up with Qatar as it has a very large wealth divide. This divide makes it much easier for people to take part in bribes. In 1995 there was a cross national study focusing on ethics this study found that there was substantial crossover between personality values but the moral reasoning very significantly. The psychologists use social cognitive theory to explain the practical implications of this study. This could explain why some countries are more likely to be involved in bribery than others due to social cognitive theory and shared values of a society. There are many different areas of psychology that relate directly to bribery and corruption and the FIFA scandal. These theories should be able to show a way for bribery to be reduced in the future. This can be seen using the evolutionary psychology principle. This theory states that there are distinct patterns of corruption that can be seen throughout history with the FIFA 2015 corruption scandal named as one. This theory explains that social and cultural norms have evolved over time to allow to happen more freely. This could be good news for FIFA as it could explain why so much bribery has happened within the organisation and it could help reduce their blame and liability for the bribery. This theory can also show how to reduce bribery within FIFA in the future.          <nl><nl>Legal Case:<nl>The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates and in capability of anyone to be able to keep try and punish such a large organisation. FIFA is billion-pound empire that effectively has the ability to punish countries this makes them untouchable. This system negatively affects smaller and poorer countries. Morocco was also competing for the 2022 World Cup and after spending millions on the campaign they lost out to Qatar due to the bribes Qatar paid to FIFA officials.  Currently 32 teams and subsequently 32 countries play in the World Cup, FIFA have been discussing pushing this to 48 countries. Bringing more countries in to the World Cup could potentially reduce corruption and bribery as that is more accountability and even more countries will be watching them. However, this could go the other way and now there are 16 more countries that could be involved in bribery. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup they Denied Moscow the chance to host the World Cup. It could be argued that Morocco deserve the World Cup more as they are a smaller economy and the World Cup would have benefited them more than guitar. It could also be argued that after the truck in time like Morocco should have been awarded the World Cup. There has been talks of Spain Portugal and Morocco  teaming up for a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup however Spain and Portugal signed a joint bid agreement and left Morocco out once again this could be devastating for Morocco\u2019s economy. There have been studies into GDP and corruption. Catarrhs GDP is 175.8 billion c compared to Morocco\u2019s 119.7 both in 2019. The study indicates that the poorer country the more likely they are to be susceptible to corruption however in this example that does not seem to be the case as base of GDP Qatar has more wealth but clearly, they were more susceptible to bribery.  <nl>To conclude it appears that FIFA have not done everything in their power to prevent further corruption happening since the 2015 scandal. However, it is a very large and complex issue that covers many legal and political jurisdictions. This therefore makes it very hard to give definitive answer to how well FIFA dealt with the scandal. From my research for this essay, I have come across many recommendations for how FIFA could reduce bribery and corruption from so many different academic disciplines and the fact that FIFA has not implemented any of the shows FIFA has not learnt from 2015. On balance it appears they have not made enough changes to prevent this from happening again.", "positive": "<addr1_FN>,<nl><nl>Please can you help me.

Alpha activity at the left parietal lobe (P3) was higher 200ms before stimulus onset when the stimulus was cued to the left compared to the right. This supports Klimesch\u2019s (2007) alpha inhibition hypothesis, stating that high alpha activity indicates inhibition in task-irrelevant brain regions. This finding paves way to further research on the implications of alpha activity and its relation to anticipatory attention. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha oscillations (8-13Hz) have an inhibitory function and are involved in attentional selection and suppression (Klimesch, 2012). The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007) highlights that high alpha activity indicates inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. Alpha activity is modulated by attention, as when stimuli are presented on a screen, contralateral brain areas are activated and ipsilateral are inhibited (task irrelevant).<nl>Mazahari et al.\u2019s (2014) cued flanker task involved typically developing (TD), combined subtype, and inattentive ADHD participants. Null or response preparation (RP) cues preceded each trial, with an 84% accuracy of the correct direction to attend. The AIH was demonstrated as TD adolescents showed the greatest alpha suppression following the RP cues, with inattentive ADHD subtypes showing the least, due to their difficulty responding to environmental cues. Greatest alpha suppression was detected directly after cue onset for the TD group, with no group difference in alpha suppression following a null cue, suggesting that RP cues influence the lateralisation of processing.<nl>Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) cued visual attention task involved a central arrow indicating which hemifield, a 50% chance of being cued left or right, the participants should attend to. The target stimulus was then presented, and participants were asked whether the bar was small or large (50% chance of each). Congruent trials included an instructional cue which was consistent with the location of the bar (75% of trials), and 25% of trials incongruent.<nl>Congruent trials showed stronger alpha suppression on sides contralateral to the hemifield where the stimuli were processed, derived from EEG recordings of the parietal, frontal, and fronto-medial regions, further supporting the AIH. Incongruent trials had an opposite effect due to incorrect anticipation of the stimulus. Fronto-medial and parietal regions demonstrated phase coupling between the RP cue and stimulus onset, and post-stimulus (200-600ms). <nl>Previous research shows alpha activity increases on the contralateral side to the stimuli attended, being most prominent in parietal and occipital regions before stimulus onset. The current study partially replicates Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) cued visual attention task, hypothesising an increased alpha activity in the left parietal lobe (P3) when stimuli are presented on the left hemifield compared to the right, before target stimuli are presented for congruent trials.  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 psychology undergraduate students were selected via opportunity sampling, but one participant\u2019s data was excluded as data was only available for one condition of the experiment.<nl><nl>Design<nl>A repeated measures design consisted of the independent variable (cue location) with two levels: left or right hemifield, and the dependent variable (the alpha amplitudes of the P3 electrode in \ud835\udf07V (microvolts)). <nl><nl>Materials<tab><nl>The active EEG electrode was used to record alpha activity, the reference electrode provided a comparison and the earth electrode reduced interference, all connected to Biopac MP36 for data collection. Everi cream removed dead skin from the scalp, and AC cream adhered the electrode to the scalp, improving conductivity. Psychopy presented stimuli and sent event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. The stimuli were two arrow cues (&lt; and &gt;), and two bars (Figure 1).<nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Alpha band oscillations (8\u201313Hz) were identified in the raw EEG data recorded (0.5-35Hz) with a sampling rate of 1000Hz. The 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Technologies, 2012) was employed, wherein the active electrode was attached to P3, reference to Fz, and earth to the forehead near the hairline. An impedance reading &lt;10k\u03a9 was required prior to data collection, after which eligible participants were provided the right to withdraw and informed consent retrieved.<nl>Participants engaged in a practice trial, which began with instructions stating a cue would appear on the screen informing them which side to anticipate a stimulus, followed by a brief pause and either a small or large bar appearing on the appropriate side of the screen. Participants were then instructed to press \u2018L\u2019 if a large or \u2018S\u2019 if a small bar appeared on the screen. The cue (&lt; or &gt;) was displayed for 35ms, followed by a fixation cross to recapture participants\u2019 attention to the centre of the screen, and then a small or large bar appearing on the specific hemifield for 50ms. Feedback was provided after each trial, with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 800ms and 12 trials in total in the practice run. The practice run involved 4 trial types (arrow right to either small or large bar, and arrow left to either small or large bar) each repeating 3 times. The practice run involved only congruent trials; arrows pointed to the hemifield where the stimulus was presented.<nl>After completing the practice trials, participants were introduced to the experimental trials and recording of EEG alpha activity commenced. Experimental trials differed as no feedback was provided after trials, the ISI was between 200-1200ms, 25% of the trials were incongruent (stimulus was presented in the opposite side that the cue pointed to) and 75% congruent. Event markers were sent at stimulus onset, and each trial type was repeated 20 times in a randomised order (80 trials in total), wherein 50% of trials cued left and 50% right.<nl>Upon completion, the electrodes were removed, gel cleaned from the scalp and participants were debriefed.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>Event markers were used to identify stimulus onset. Alpha activity was investigated after display of arrow cues and 200ms before stimulus onset.  The data was rectified to convert negative values into positive, showing the average signal strength (\ud835\udf07V) compared to the range, regardless of activity being inhibitory or excitatory. Data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the effects of outliers. Rectification and integration ensured that accurate means were taken for each condition. These rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for further analysis. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied as the normality of data assumption for Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test was violated (p &lt; .05).<nl>Table 1. <nl>Median and interquartile ranges for alpha amplitudes in left parietal lobe in cued left and cued right conditions (n=38).<nl><nl><table><nl><nl>Table 1. shows median RAAA in P3 was greater in the cue left compared to cue right condition 200ms before stimulus onset, and a Wilcoxon signed rank test shows this difference was significant (W=566, n=38, p =.005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>200ms prior to stimulus onset, RAAA increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left compared to the right hemifield, supporting the research hypothesis. Stimuli presented on the left hemifield led to an increase in alpha activity on the left hemisphere due to inhibition as this region is task-irrelevant, and stimuli processed on the contralateral hemisphere led to increased alpha activity at P3. The findings support both the AIH and Sauseng et al.\u2019s (2005) findings, showing an increase in alpha activity in task-irrelevant regions prior to stimulus presentation. This is because RP cueing affects the lateralisation of processing, leading to the anticipation of stimuli appearing on the same hemifield the cue directed them to.<nl>A methodological flaw is that high impedance affects data quality as it leads to variance in the measurements and requires more trials to ensure statistical significance in analyses of P3 (Kappenman and Luck, 2010). This can be mitigated by high pass filtering and artifact rejection, along with using a cool dry recording environment.<nl>The findings of this study lend weight to Klimesch\u2019s (2007) AIH, and the influence of attention on alpha brain activity. Future research should explore specific types of attention e.g., anticipatory and temporal, and their influence on alpha activity.", "positive": "<addr6_NN>,<nl><nl>Apologies for the late response, I just wanted to say a massive thank you for helping me out.

{"anchor": "The Stroop Test, first developed in 1935 by John R. Stroop, was designed to study the effect of interference when presented with pairs of conflicting stimuli (Stroop, 1935). This original study showed that the verbal identification of the colour of a word is delayed by the word being a colour-word and incongruent to the font colour (Allport, 1990).<nl>The Stroop Test shows the effect of inhibition, a central executive function used to override an immediate response to a stimulus, demonstrated by the overriding of the semantic meaning of the word shown in order to correctively identify the font colour (Eysenck &amp; Keane, 2015).<nl>It is also an example of automaticity in reading (Hunt &amp; Ellis, 2004). Automatic processes are not conducted with intent, they are not able to be thought through before they happen, and do not take up any conscious processing capacity; The Stroop test demonstrates this with the automaticity involved when the stimulus is first seen (Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975).<nl>The fact that the Stroop test covers so many aspects of cognitive processing makes it a significant study in the field of cognitive psychology. Variations of the study also provide a range of results on which hypotheses can be based.<nl>Based on past research, it is predicted that when the colours are incongruent, the time taken to respond to the font colour will be longer in comparison to when the colours are congruent.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>123 participants were used from a volunteer sample of Aston University 1st Year Psychology students, ranging from approximately 18-22 years old.<nl>Design<nl>The study was a within subjects design, with each participant responding to both congruent and incongruent stimuli, this being the independent variable; whether the font colour was congruent with the colour meaning of the word. The dependent variable was the response time for the participants to report the colour of the font.<nl>Materials<nl>Superlab was used to create and conduct the study, and using the Superlab timing feature enabled accurate response times to be obtained.<nl>A set of simple jpeg images were used as stimuli. These showed various colour words in various coloured fonts (red, blue, green, or yellow), with half of the stimuli\u2019s meaning and font colour being the same (congruent) or different (incongruent).<nl>The participants could use Superlab\u2019s response option to input the font colour of each stimulus using a set of coloured computer keys, and once having familiarised themselves with the order of the keys they were able to respond as soon as they had processed the colour of the stimuli.<nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Firstly, participants were given a full briefing on the experiment and it\u2019s aims, as past studies had shown that there was little-to-no effect of participants knowing the experiment aims. They were asked to sign a consent form, allowing their data to be used in the experiment report. <nl>Instructions were given verbally; however, this was unnecessary as all participants were already familiar with the experiment. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to the font colour of the stimuli, but ignore the meaning of the words shown. The participants were told to respond by tapping a coloured computer key corresponding with their response. Their response times were recorded by the Superlab program.<nl>The stimuli were presented one at a time in a random order, with congruence and incongruence also randomised and counterbalanced.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Only 115 out of the total 123 participants inputted results, causing n to equal 115.<nl><table><nl>There was a significant difference between colour congruent and colour incongruent conditions                (T = 1932.00, n = 115, p &lt; 0.001). As mean reaction times were larger in the incongruent condition than in the congruent condition, the participants took significantly longer to identify font colours when they were incongruent with the meaning of the colour word. The standard deviations suggest that there was a high variance in both conditions, but more variance in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition.<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results obtained from the experiment showed that participants took significantly longer to correctly respond to the font colour stimulus when the font colour was incongruent with the word meaning than when the font colour was congruent. This is concurrent with past experiments in the same area and is consistent with the original hypothesis. <nl>The results collected can be used to explain many aspects of perception and internal processing. The fact that the semantic meaning of the stimulus words can affect the time taken to respond to the visual colour of the font supports the Flanker Effect (Sanders &amp; Lamers, 2002) and in turn the theory of Late Attentional Selection (Lavie &amp; Tsal, 1994), as it suggests that unattended stimuli can influence our conscious thoughts and actions.<nl>However, there were some methodological issues with this study. In this experiment, every participant received a slightly differently worded brief as there was no standardised instructions created for the study and all briefs were given by different investigators. There was also the issue of multiple trial situations. Sections of the participant group undertook the study at different times of day, different days and in different rooms. This may have influenced the results collected and should have been controlled for by having all participants complete the study at the same time under the same conditions.<nl>There is a wide range of modifications to this experiment that could be made to study the different aspects of the original Stroop test, one of which is to explore the effects of context and internal state of participants on response time. Again, there are several ways this could be conducted in order to produce evidence to support real world debates, one of which is to test the effects of chemical imbalances on the Stroop test. Although it could be modified further to make it more applicable to the real world, at a basic level the original Stroop test could be conducted under the influence of various chemical substances, e.g. Alcohol, to test the effects of these chemicals on perception of target stimuli in the presence of distractors.<nl>", "positive": "med to be, he\u2019s checking if <pers_FN> can make the <DDth><new>No, we can do a proper brunch in the sun instead?<new>Thank you!

{"anchor": "Background Information<nl><nl>Kenya Airways celebrated 43 years of operations in January 2020. However, according to passengers who have recently flown with Kenya Airways, the airline is performing poorly and not meeting customer expectations. Standards have decreased and the quality of the overall experience has worsened. Based on the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, this is evident. There have been many occurrences of lost luggage, poor customer service within the airport and on the aircraft, and insufficient in-flight entertainment. This report will address these complaints using the quantitative and qualitative data collected and analysed to make comparisons with and provide sufficient recommendations for improvement.<nl>Quantitative Research<nl><nl><nl>Secondary data, \"data previously collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand.\" (Malhotra, Nunan and Birks, 2017) was gathered for a 5-year period (2016 - 2020 inclusive). The data was then logged into an Excel spreadsheet, where the customer name, gender, travel month and year, cabin type i.e. economy, route i.e. international, origin and destination were provided along with the overall rating of the experience and individual rating of each characteristic. The sampling technique used was stratified sampling: \"\u2026a two-step process to partition the population into strata. Elements are selected from each stratum randomly.\" (Malhotra, Birks and Willis, 2013). Customers\u2019 reviews were picked based on the year but at random. This technique was also chosen due to its increased precision and the need to include important information i.e. all eight individual ratings completed. Customers who had not completed all eight reviews were ignored during the selection procedure as all eight reviews had to be completed to enable graphs to be drawn and comparisons and conclusions to be made. <nl><nl>The question that rises from the data collected is: \"does gender influence the ratings of airline services?\" The two sample groups are male and female. A grouping variable t-test was carried out to work out the significance (appendix 2b). Since we have two groups, we want to compare the mean of \u2018Array 1\u2019 represented by males and \u2018Array 2\u2019 represented by females. As it is not known which gender scored a higher average rating, a two-tailed test using equal variances (2) needs to be carried out. Our results show a significance of 0.56 (to 2 d.p.), which indicates that it is not statistically significant. The significance value is more than 0.05 (p&gt;0.05) and the t-value is less than 1.96 (t&lt;1.96) which proves the results are not significant. Therefore, there is no difference in one gender rating services higher than the other, and there is no expectation that the differences will be replicated in other samples. <nl><nl>To support this further, the airline characteristics ratings were split by gender, where the number of males were 50 and the number of females were 28. A table of the average individual ratings and standard deviation were recorded (appendix 2a) and a graph to represent the averages was drawn as shown on the next page.<nl><figure><nl>From the graph, it is evident that females gave lower ratings compared to males (except for \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019, where males rated it an average of 3.10 and females rated it 3.18). The biggest difference in ratings was for \u2018legroom\u2019 with a difference of 0.33. The standard deviation for males and females is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and there is a normal distribution. Therefore, it supports our hypothesis test of there not being a significant difference. An overall average airline rating was calculated and plotted in a graph as shown below. <nl><figure><nl>The graph shows that the most poorly rated characteristic was the \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 with a rating of 3.06. With all individual ratings being around 3, the overall rating can be assumed as an average of 3. We can compare these results with the overview of the official rating of the airline displayed on the TripAdvisor website (appendix 1b). The link for the website page is indicated by appendix 1c. The results are similar to the TripAdvisor ratings meaning the data collected is representative of the population. The standard deviation was also calculated for comparison and recorded in a table along with the averages (appendix 1a). From the table, it is evident that the standard deviation is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and that there is a normal distribution.<nl><nl>To understand whether each characteristic has improved from 2016-2020, a table of averages was created (appendix 3). The table shows the total average for each year declining, where the best year was 2016 (average of 3.77) and the worst year was 2020 (average of 2.91) \u2013 the graph indicates this. A line graph was drawn to represent this information (below).<nl><nl><figure><nl>The biggest decline was from 2019 to 2020, with a difference of 0.44. However, there was an improvement in the customer service from 2018-2019 with a rise of 0.57. In the year 2017, \u2018cleanliness\u2019 had the highest average (3.92) compared to the rest of the years. Again, this proves that quality of services has been declining. Therefore, the overall quality of characteristics has worsened.<nl>Qualitative Research<nl><nl>To further support the quantitative analysis, secondary qualitative research was carried out. This was done by randomly selecting 25 customer reviews from the years 2016-2020 (5 for each year). All 25 reviews were analysed, and a coding frame (appendix 4a) was written up to categorise the factors further. For example, check-in and boarding was broken down into flights, luggage, and other. This was to understand in detail what the reviews highlighted.<nl><nl>Appendix 4b indicates an example of an analysed positive review that includes characteristics such as value for money, check-in and boarding, seat comfort, food and beverage, and in-flight entertainment. For example, the customer (travel year 2020) commented on the \u2018seats being very comfortable\u2019. The average rating for seat comfort in 2020 was 3.10. Although there was a very minor decrease (0.05) from 2019, it can be assumed the seat comfort is steady and quality is not changing drastically. <nl><nl>However, throughout the 5-year period, customer service was the most frequently complained about (airline staff and cabin crew) with a total of 12 negative complaints each. Airline staff includes staff who are not directly involved in the airport or aircraft, but are still part of Kenya Airways staff i.e. headquarters, call centres etc. The majority of complaints relating to airline staff were about staff being unfriendly, impolite, and incompetent. Some reviews mentioned that staff need to be trained as there was no sense of empathy. On the other hand, there was 1 positive review which mentioned the service being on a \u2018high level\u2019. Cabin crew also had 12 negative reviews, mostly about the staff not caring about errors made as well as not apologising. On the other hand, there were 9 positive reviews, making the total -3. This tells us that although there are positive customer service reviews, there are more negative ones meaning that customer service is worsening over the years. This can be also be proved by the graph shown by appendix 3 where the customer service rating fell from 2016 (4.00) to 2020 (2.90). This indicates greater confidence in customer service declining as there are frequent reviews to support this.<nl><nl>Appendix 4c shows a negative review written by a customer in 2016. The review mentions customer service (airport staff and cabin crew) and food and beverage (qualityportion). Again, customer service was poor due to staff not caring or apologising. Furthermore, the airline had run out of vegetarian meals and no drinks were offered either. The coding frame shows the total for \u2018qualityportion\u2019 as -3, indicating that the airline is performing poorly in this service. Appendix 1a highlights that \u2018food and beverage\u2019 is the second lowest characteristic rated by customers with an average of 3.25. This supports the coding frame.<nl>On the other hand, there are three characteristics where the airline is performing well \u2013 legroom, seat comfort, and food and beverage \u2013 taste. The total scores based on the coding frame are 2, 3, and 2 respectively. Legroom had 2 positive reviews, both commenting on spaciousness, seat comfort had 4 positive reviews, and food and beverage \u2013 taste, had 4 positive reviews commenting on good and fresh taste. However, there were also negative reviews for seat comfort, where seats were not as comfortable and the taste of food not being great. Overall, Kenya Airways are doing well in these areas of service. Appendix 1a shows this for \u2018legroom\u2019 as it has the second highest average rating of 3.60, which supports the qualitative research and indicates greater confidence since reviews are consistent hence representative.<nl><nl>Whilst appendix 4b has a positive review based on flying business class, other customers travelling in business class had negative experiences, based on poor customer service, rude staff and lost luggage. Therefore, this demonstrates inconsistency of the airline as customers are receiving different treatment even when demographics are the same. Rather, customers in business class are having the same issues as those travelling in economy, which raises the question as to whether Kenya Airways view all customers as equivalent despite paying extra for better service. Moreover, staff are lacking in training which leads to poor service regardless of whichever cabin customers are flying in.<nl>Recommendations<nl><nl>Kenya Airways are performing at an average level (3.0) in comparison to competitors such as Qatar Airways (4.0) (Qatar Airways Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020) and Emirates (4.0) (Emirates Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020). While Kenya Airways are scoring close to an average rating of 4.0 in characteristics such as \u2018cleanliness\u2019 (3.71) and \u2018legroom\u2019 (3.60), they are scoring low in characteristics such as \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 (3.06) and \u2018food and beverage\u2019 (3.25) while receiving frequent complaints about services such as \u2018check-in and boarding\u2019 and \u2018customer service\u2019. Therefore, in order to excel, regain customer confidence and outperform competitors, many improvements need to be made throughout the airline. <nl><nl>Firstly, improvements need to be made in customer service, mainly the airport staff and cabin crew. According to reviews on TripAdvisor, the cabin crew have a lack of care and are impolite towards passengers. As suggested by customers and to avoid future negative interactions with passengers, training needs to take place frequently e.g. every 4-6 months to ensure staff members are able to handle situations with care, show understanding and remain polite. Once training is complete, staff should be tested by answering scenario questions. Those who score less than 70% should undergo further training. The process can be repeated until they score 70% or over. Customers who feel comfortable and at ease are more likely to have a positive flight experience, resulting in greater positive reviews and higher ratings. Moreover, airport staff are being criticised of showing attitude and being unhelpful. Again, training needs to take place to avoid future negative experiences. A similar assessment as the cabin crew can be carried out with questions aimed more specifically for airport staff.<nl><nl>Secondly, the in-flight entertainment needs to be improved. Passengers have complained about the equipment being broken and the movie list not being up to date. This can be quite frustrating especially when flying for long hours as there is no sufficient entertainment available to use. The first course of action should be for the movie listing to be updated (as mentioned in one review) on all aeroplanes and provide a wider array of entertainment as Emirates do (appendix 5). This will keep passengers entertained for the length of the flight. To avoid faulty equipment, all equipment should be checked before passengers aboard the plane.<nl><nl>Finally, the portion and overall quality of food needs to be improved. There have been a number of complains written by customers who mention the portion size of food is little and sometimes drinks are not offered either. This can be seen as unacceptable, especially for those flying in businessfirst class as complimentary drinks are mandatory and passengers are paying extra (value for money). Portions need to increase as a result, by up to 25% to satisfy expectations and drinks need to be offered with every meal, as well as in between.", "positive": "<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I'm not sure whom I should be contacting about this issue so I'm emailing yourselves and hopefully you are able to guide me through or direct me to whom I need to contact.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I'm filling in the application form for re-enrolment however I'm not sure what to put down for funding since my placement is unpaid.

{"anchor": "Pregnancy loss is often silenced and shamed whether it\u2019s miscarriages, termination for medical reasons or stillborn deaths (Keane, 2009). This essay will focus specifically on miscarriages in the first trimester because of the stigma surrounding the validation of mourning a \u2018human that didn\u2019t exist\u2019. This essay will also explore the discussions around motherhood, why women feel they are labelled \u2018failed mothers\u2019, and recommendations to reduce the stigma around early miscarriages.<nl>Motherhood has been the central and imperative role in a woman\u2019s life. In a woman\u2019s lifetime, she is expected to reproduce in order to fulfil the responsibility of \u2018bearers of the collective\u2019. The importance of being the \u2018bearers of the collective\u2019 ensures that reproduction allows society to function, and never \u2018die out\u2019. Because of this duty, these expectations have shaped women\u2019s identities to believe all women will become mothers. Early miscarriages go against the concept of motherhood, and for this reason, there is stigmatisation around miscarriages. Stigma is defined as an \u2018attribute that is deeply discrediting\u2019 (Goffman, 1963:3), hence the shame and silence around miscarriages. Because of this stigma and duty placed on women, miscarriages deem women to be \u2018failed mothers\u2019.<nl>Many women believe they\u2019ll have a successful pregnancy and start to prepare for the new addition. However, not all pregnancies are successful. In fact, \u2018first trimester miscarriages are by far the most frequent type of pregnancy loss\u2019 (Layne, 2000:325). When a miscarriage occurs, no one is to blame, however, the blame tends to fall on the woman (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Blame-shifting is a central factor of the stigmatisation around early miscarriages. The blame goes to the extent of the woman also accepting the blame, and believing she was the cause of the miscarriage (Miller, 2015). Moreover, the blame reinforces her inabilities as she renders herself incapable and questions whether something is wrong with her (Miller, 2015; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). A study conducted by Abboud &amp; Liamputtong (2002) found that participants were blamed for their activities which allegedly caused their miscarriage. For example, a participant stated, \"They blame me that it\u2019s my fault, that when I was pregnant, I was dancing, that I wasn\u2019t eating properly. It\u2019s my fault that this happened\" (2002:47). However, according to Sandford Health, it\u2019s essential to exercise to combat the fatigue and hormonal changes during the first trimester (Seitz, 2019). Furthermore, the search for reasoning in early miscarriages causes blame-shifting on the woman, in which she accepts she has failed her duty to be the bearer of the collective, and essentially she is seen as a failed mother.<nl>As aforementioned, the blame allows the woman to accept the moral responsibility of the demise, but realistically she has failed an expectation which is uprooted in intensive motherhood. Intensive motherhood is the philosophy of maximising the potential of a person to become a better version of themselves. In this case, women have adapted to this belief through the understanding of gender roles. Gender roles have set in stone that women are to be housewives and mothers, and from a young age, girls are taught how to cook and nurture. A participant stated that \"the illusion is created not during the pregnancy, but when we are small girls, when we\u2019re still playing with dolls, we already think about being mothers, about children, because it\u2019s in our nature\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:16). The bonding with dolls maximises the potential for young girls to become mothers in the future. In addition, the act of bonding is extended in pregnancy which develops attachment between the woman and the foetus. However, miscarriages interrupt the bonding process that women have adopted since they were young, leaving them confused and empty. The impact of intensive motherhood allows women to develop the \u2018picture-perfect\u2019 family idea and believe having children fulfils their purpose of being a woman. In essence, the woman\u2019s identity is defined by her ability to conceive. <nl>The intensive motherhood belief also implies that women have to become mothers, and this contributes to the reason why women try again after a miscarriage to maintain the responsibility of the bearer of the collective. A husband of a participant in the Abboud &amp; Liamputtong study said that \"she kept trying\u2026she insisted\u2026she wanted a boy, like all the other women\" and this was due to his wife feeling she needed a baby to please her husband (2002:54). This implies that miscarriages make women feel they\u2019re inadequate wivespartners, as well as inadequate women, and in order to change that, they must conceive. This also echoes the discussion that motherhood validates a woman\u2019s place in society. Becoming a mother makes a woman an accepted person in society and even in her family home. All in all, intensive motherhood prepares women for the position they play in society \u2013 which is to become mothers. Until they do so, they\u2019re \u2018failed mothers\u2019 or \u2018deviant women\u2019. <nl>Intensive motherhood works symbiotically with the policing of women\u2019s bodies and behaviours. The first trimester of pregnancies is labelled as the \u2018risky period\u2019 (first 12 weeks) because this is when early miscarriages occur. For this reason, women are told to not get \u2018too excited\u2019 until the first trimester has passed. This period controls the woman\u2019s experience of pregnancy due to biomedical framings. Rothman quoted in Ross (2015) states that \u2018demands are placed on women to emotionally distance themselves from the pregnancy, and suspend experiences of attachment to the foetus until \u2018it is deemed worth keeping\u2019. For first time pregnancies, holding in excitement is almost impossible, therefore this biomedical framing creates a sense of uncertainty. Shildrick quoted in Ross (2015) argues that women\u2019s bodies have been labelled as inferior. This implies that medical input has superiority over the woman\u2019s body and makes it their obligation to know what\u2019s right for her. Due to the \u2018risky period\u2019, women tend to keep the news to themselves and remain quiet about their pregnancy. Additionally, because of stigmatisation around early miscarriages, women refrain from announcing the news of their pregnancy to avoid announcing that they miscarried, and this is to avoid felt stigma and the actual stigma itself. Furthermore, women felt that society\u2019s conventions around hiding a pregnancy until after the first trimester meant they felt alone and isolated in their feelings (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:7). Overall, the biomedical framings have created a scare around the first trimester in order to avoid the stigmatisation of being labelled a failed mother.<nl>Policing of women\u2019s behaviours and bodies has become a routinized process, and women themselves believe every medical input is necessary during the pregnancy. During pregnancy, women are told what to eat and drink, especially at antenatal appointments. Undoubtedly, antenatal appointments have the intention of ensuring the health of the woman and the baby is prioritised, but there are elements of policing and monitoring her behaviours. For a first time pregnancy, up to 10 antenatal appointments are expected, and 7 for those who have had a child already (NHS, 2020), and these appointments \u2018feature detailed discussions of women\u2019s behaviours and encouragement to modify those seen as posing a risk to the pregnancy\u2019 (Ross, 2015:330). These modifications allow women to think that if she doesn\u2019t follow these rules, she is the cause of the miscarriage. In fact, most women follow the instructions of pregnancy, yet many still suffer miscarriages in the first trimester. These instructions imply that medical attention plays their part to also maximise the potential of a woman becoming a mother. Over time, women\u2019s bodies have become the embodiment of distrust therefore medical attention during pregnancy is a core contribution to the transition from womanhood to motherhood, to avoid having a miscarriage. In brevity, if these rules are followed, it\u2019s believed there are slim chances of miscarriages, and if they aren\u2019t followed, a woman causes her miscarriage and she is a failed mother.<nl>The \u2018risky period\u2019 (12 weeks of gestation) can pose implications that the foetus isn\u2019t an actual human until birth, therefore mourning a miscarriage tends to be unrecognised. The validity of the foetus can be discussed through the concept of foetal personhood. Foetal personhood raises questions in the validation of a woman\u2019s loss as some would regard the foetus as \u2018medical waste\u2019. Martel\u2019s study (2014) found that in Canada, pregnancies ending under 20 weeks gestation andor under the birth weight of 500 grams are not registered with Statistics Canada or issued a birth or death certificate. This indicates that foetuses shouldn\u2019t be honoured like newborn babies, due to the fact that \u2018miscarriage is not socially recognised in the same way that the loss of a born baby or family member might be\u2019 (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:2).<nl>Medical technologies, such as ultrasounds and sonograms encourage the foetus to be seen as \u2018real\u2019, from a foetus to a baby. These technologies allow women to become attached to the foetus, and when the miscarriage occurs, the woman feels a great loss due to the bonding formed in the first trimester, and accept that the pregnancy loss is also real. In reality, some women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant until they take pregnancy tests. They can assume the miscarriage is a delayed period, but the role of medical technologies encourages women to think of their \u2018wished-for child as a person\u2019 (Layne quoted in Keane 2009). Similarly, the assumption of the mother role is strengthened by hospital visits and medical technologies because the woman assumes she is a mother. The definition of a mother is \"a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth to\" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2002), and in the case of early miscarriages, this raises questions as to whether the woman who miscarried can mourn as if she were a mother. Nevertheless, whether the woman should be seen as a mother or not, the imagining of the child-to-be should validate her reasoning to feel the loss. The \u2018construction of the \u2018child\u2019 is created by social actors (the parents) whose identities are shaped by being in a family relationship with them, and without this construction, the \u2018child\u2019 cannot exist\u2019 (Mullin, 2015:32). Moreover, Mullin (2015) argues that although the foetus didn\u2019t reach its full potential, it had the potential to do so, therefore the loss of a miscarried foetus should be recognised. Undeniably, the part medical technologies play in foetal personhood reinforces early miscarriages as a failure. The dismissal of recognition for miscarried foetuses further embodies that women who miscarry are failed mothers, as their miscarried foetus isn\u2019t commemorated and is seen as \u2018medical waste\u2019.<nl>As previously mentioned, early miscarriages are regarded as medical waste, which invalidates the woman\u2019s grief. The woman\u2019s emotions during and after the miscarriage can be strengthened by her friends, family and medical staff by showing a lack of support, which further emphasises the woman labelled as a failed mother. Bellhouse\u2019s study (2018) found that previous research shows that women affected by miscarriages feel a lack of recognition of their loss, as well as emotional support from those close to them. It is understandable that the woman\u2019s support bubble may not understand her loss, but the emotional distance makes the woman feel alone. Some people around the woman encourage her to \u2018get over it\u2019 and forget about it, and urge her to try again. In Gerber-Epstein\u2019s study (2008), a woman\u2019s family had the tendency to insist her to return back to normality and try again. Another woman in the study recalled a doctor saying \"\u2026you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about, you\u2019ll have a bleed in a few days.\" (2008:11). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong\u2019s study (2002), a woman\u2019s husband said \"\u2026the doctor said a couple of weeks and back to normal life and you can have a baby next month\" (2002:47). The lack of recognition of the woman\u2019s grief and healing is prevalent around early miscarriages, which downplays her mourning. These quotes also reveal that women have to constantly work on fulfilling the responsibility of the bearers of the collective, despite what may be going on around them.<nl>Women who have suffered early miscarriages feel shame and embarrassment from their social circle. Some go as far as making insensitive comments and finding the silver lining in the miscarriage. In Bellhouse\u2019s study, they found that \"approximately half of the women expressed feeling that others often did not understand their experience and therefore struggled to empathise with them and support them at the time of their miscarriage, leading to feelings of hurt and disappointment\"(2018:5). People said to a participant in Bellhouse\u2019s study \"oh you know, you\u2019ll get pregnant again\u2019, or, um, \u2018oh it was meant to be\" (2018:6). Apart from the insensitive comments, people found ways to blame women for their life choices and activities (e.g. working too hard) as a reason for the miscarriage (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). The shame and embarrassment also extend to women over the age of 30 that miscarry. Although there is no set age for childbearing, it is believed that childbearing rates start to fall low in women over the age of 30 (Noord-Zaadstra, et al., 1991). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong\u2019s study, a participant\u2019s husband stated \"\u2026she was crazy to get pregnant again. In her mind she was too old, and it\u2019s very hard to get pregnant again with her age and menopause\" (2002:53). The woman in the study was between the ages of 37-38, yet she felt she had to prove to her husband her capability to become a mother. Furthermore, this reveals older women experience the stigma of being a failed mother, seeing as they\u2019re nearing the age of menopause. The lack of support from family and friends of the woman suffering from the miscarriage strengthens her label as a \u2018failed mother\u2019 as many fail to legitimise her feelings, instead they urge her to try again, rather than allowing her to grieve and heal.<nl>The aftermath of early miscarriages makes women experience feelings such as helplessness, sadness, guilt, irritability, repeated recollection of the experience and fear (Walker &amp; Davidson quoted in Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Many women who experience an early miscarriage feel they\u2019re worthless, disabled, and inadequate (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008; Ross, 2015). During this period, women can become envious of other women with children because it reminds them that they\u2019re failed mothers (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Moreover, women feel they have disappointed themselves and everyone around them. Some women go as far as opting for tubal ligation and adoption seeing as they\u2019re unable to conceive. A woman revealed she and her partner were planning tubal ligation to prevent future pregnancies as she had suffered seven miscarriages (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Similarly, another woman said \"I was already thinking I ought to adopt a child, because I already said I wouldn\u2019t be able to have children\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:15). These women have accepted that they are failed mothers due to the frequency of miscarriages, and settle for alternatives. Women who have experienced early miscarriages often feel scared to get pregnant again, because they feel that their future pregnancies will result in early miscarriages. Overall, these feelings remind women of what they\u2019re not \u2013 which is a mother. Early miscarriages also remind them that they have defied the transition from womanhood to motherhood, and they have failed the duty of the bearers of the collective.  <nl>These feelings tend to go unnoticed and untreated by the woman\u2019s support bubble and medical staff, and if left ignored, it can haunt the woman for a long time (Frost, et al., 2007). It\u2019s important that women who have suffered early miscarriages feel they\u2019re not failed mothers, neither are they alone. In regards to family and friends, it\u2019s important for them to speak about the miscarriage so the woman isn\u2019t the only one acknowledging the loss. A woman and her husband found that speaking about the miscarriage helped her grieving process (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002), and women who spoke to other women who had miscarried felt it helped them (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). It\u2019s also vital that the woman\u2019s family and friends are willing to listen to her, and allow her to mourn at her own pace (Bellhouse, et al., 2018; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Creating memories are just as important because it acknowledges the loss, rather than forgetting the miscarriage. A couple found it helpful to take their miscarried babies to their house to create memories and reminders (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Other women found comfort in commemorating their miscarriage through pregnancy loss websites where the miscarried children are represented in the form of angels (Keane, 2009).<nl>Medical care needs to devote time for counselling and support for women after miscarriages to help them process the miscarriage, as well as being sensitive and reassuring (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Women also feel medical care should provide more information and knowledge on miscarriages so women understand how common it is (Frost, et al., 2007; Bellhouse, et al., 2018). In addition, society needs to acknowledge the loss so women don\u2019t feel stigmatised. Suggestions such as public speeches, talks, and medical conferences can lessen the silence around early miscarriages (Frost, et al., 2007). Most importantly, it\u2019s important to stop the blame-shifting onto women who miscarry (Frost, et al., 2007), and to stop the tradition of secrecy during the first trimester of pregnancy (the \u2018risky period\u2019). These recommendations will help women know they\u2019re not failed mothers. Educating society and women\u2019s support bubbles will improve the healing process for women.<nl>In conclusion, society\u2019s expectations for women as bearers of the collective has allowed women to believe they\u2019re failed mothers when they miscarry. The culture of blame-shifting contributes to women feeling invalidated until they become mothers.

{"anchor": "<question1><nl><nl>The period of adolescence is a time where behaviour is characterised by impulsivity, increased risk taking and an affinity for peer groups (Spear, 2010). During no other period in the lifespan is the prevalence of death so high relative to health, with Steinberg (2013) reporting a dramatic spike in self-inflicted behaviours such as car accidents and crime. Adolescent behaviour and the reasons for its occurrence has posed a particular question for researchers. <nl><nl>The duel systems process model proposes that adolescent typical behaviour is caused by a developmental imbalance between the subcortical socioemotional system implicated in sensitivity to rewards and novelty, relative to the cognitive control system responsible for impulse and emotional control as well as decision making (Shulman et al, 2016). The model hypothesises that the early activation and maturation of the ventral striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) in early adolescence increases one\u2019s propensity for sensation seeking whilst the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is still maturing, therefore attenuating impulse control (Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2011). It is predicted that sensation seeking behaviour increases at the early stages of adolescence and levels off as adulthood is reached, following an inverted \u2018U\u2019 shape trajectory. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob (2011) assessed this using longitudinal data from over 7000 participants aged 12-24, looking at self-reported changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking. They found that mean levels of impulsivity declined through adolescence and levelled off when participants reached their mid-20s, consistent with neurobiological research suggesting heightened activation of the ventral striatum in early to mid-adolescence relative to children and adults (Barkley-Leveson &amp; Galv\u00e1n, 2014). This supports the claim that adolescent typical behaviour is a product of nature due to the profound influence of brain structures and their relative levels of maturity on sensation seeking behaviour.  Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob\u2019s (2011) research is one of the first to report this trend using longitudinal data and to utilise such a large sample, representative of a diverse population. Furthermore, the use of such a large data set reduced the chance of type I errors. However, caution should be taken when drawing conclusions due to the risk of social desirability and response bias when using measures of self-report. <nl><nl>It has been asserted by some researchers that adolescents possess the ability to evaluate risky decisions to the same level as adults (Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006), begging the questions as to why this age group engage in risk behaviours to such a degree? Observational data suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents heightened propensity for risk (Albert et al, 2013) with researchers suggesting adaptive benefits such as increasing peer status and peer affiliation with desirable social groups (Spear, 2010). Steinberg &amp; Gardener (2005) assessed the effects of peer contexts on risky decision making in 3 age groups including adolescents (13-16), youths (18-22) and adults (24+). All 306 participants completed 3 measures of risk orientation including 2 self-report measures and a computerised driving task named the Chicken Game. In this task participants were required to make decisions about whether to advance the vehicle once a traffic light turns from green to yellow (meaning an impending red light) with the possibility of a car crash if the car advances through a red light. Participants were randomly assigned either the peer condition where they would complete the task with 2 others or the alone condition. Steinberg &amp; Gardener found that each group engaged in comparable risk taking when alone but increased risk taking when in the presence of peers, more pronounced during middle and late adolescence. This suggest adolescents\u2019 susceptibility to peer influence relative to adults when taking risk, implying the role of nurture and social contexts in adolescent typical behaviours. This study has important implications for interventions seeking to reduce risky behaviour amongst adolescence (i.e. juvenile delinquency) suggesting attention should be directed towards increasing resistance to peer influence in young people. However, this study has arguably low ecological validity as it unable to capture the complex dynamic of risk taking with peers outside of a laboratory setting.<nl><nl>In conclusion the cause of adolescent behaviour appears to be a combination of both nature and nurture influences, with research suggesting that peer influence may increase the brain\u2019s risk and reward system sensitivity (Albert et al, 2013). Subsequently, the duel process model and effects of peer stimuli may co-influence risky behaviours seen in adolescents as young people spend most of their time with peers (Spear, 2010). Therefore, the claim that adolescent behaviour reflects the influence of nature more so than nurture is not supported. <nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Research suggest adolescence is the greatest risk period for the emergence of psychopathological disorders, with mental illness affecting 1 in 5 young people (Powers &amp; Casey, 2015). In light of this, this essay shall seek to critically discuss how brain development may facilitate the high prevalence of psychopathology during adolescence.<nl><nl>Stress has been considered an important factor contributing to adolescents\u2019 vulnerability to internalising disorders, namely anxiety (Romeo, 2010). Brain areas identified as being implicated in this increased vulnerability includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which undergoes significant maturational changes and a reawakening during puberty (Spear, 2010). The HPA axis is responsible for controlling stress-induced hormonal secretion in response to stressors and does so by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation (McCormick et al.,2010). Once released, ACHT acts to increase the production and release of glucocorticoid hormones, which then act upon the brain to predetermine future responses to future stress stimuli. Using a battery of acute stressors, Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) assessed the hormonal stress response of prepubescent rats, compared to that of adult rats and found a greater, more prolonged ACHT and corticosterone response in the younger rats compared to adults. Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) suggested that it takes twice as long for these hormones to return to baseline level in premid-adolescent rats following stress stimuli relative to adult rats. Reflective of the results seen in animals, researchers have speculated that anxious individuals may show a delayed HPA axis recovery following a stressor, which in turn may make them slower to adjust to novelty, giving rise to psychopathological vulnerabilities (Spear, 2010). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results to human behaviour because of the use of animal data. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess levels of glucocorticoid in human adolescents because of the natural diurnal release rhythm it follows (Spear, 2010), meaning animal studies have provided a valuable opportunity to investigate this, whilst having strong experimental control. Furthermore, animal research is able to bypass the ethical implications to be considered when conducting human research (Eiland &amp; Romeo, 2013). <nl><nl>Attention deficithyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be defined as inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity relative to an individual\u2019s age, that interferes with their functioning (Shaw et al., 2012). Onset of ADHD is around 7 years (occurring before puberty) and is prevalent in over 5% of children worldwide (Friedman &amp; Rapoport, 2015). Research has suggested that brain development through late childhood and adolescence is an important factor contributing to ADHD. Shaw et al (2007) assessed this using a longitudinal MRI scan study of 223 ADHD diagnosed participants matched with 223 typically developing (TD) controls.  Shaw and colleagues found a marked delay in ADHD in achieving peak cortical thickness throughout the cerebrum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). This delay was most pronounced in the middle and lateral PFC, implicated in higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and planning, where peak thickness was achieved 5 years later than TD controls. In addition to this it was seen that the primary motor cortex conversely showed early maturation in ADHD (peaking age 7 years), when compared to controls (peaking age 7.4 years). Shaw and colleagues speculated that the delayed developmental trajectory of regions implicated in higher-order motor control, paired with the early maturation of the primary motor cortex may account for symptoms seen in ADHD i.e. poor motor control. This influential study was seen to be the first longitudinal neuroanatomic research evidencing the theory of delayed cortical maturation in ADHD, due to the advanced in MRI techniques seen in recent history. However, it should be noted that the results cannot endorse differences in intelligence and sexual dimorphisms seen in ADHD, despite their effect on cortical development because they strictly controlled for in the design. <nl><nl>To conclude brain maturation and development in adolescents, relative to adults seems to have implications for various psychopathologies. Spear (2010) suggests for disorders like ADHD where onset occurs just prior to adolescence, motor control regions may show developmental anomalies, whereas disorders with adolescent aged onset i.e. anxiety, show developmental differences in the frontal regions. It can be speculated that the PFC\u2019s immaturity in adolescents relative to adults, may be sensitive to the reawakening and prolonged effects of the HPA axis. However, brain development is not the only factor giving rise to psychopathologies in adolescents with mental health varying by person. Instead some researchers propose the stress-diathesis model, suggesting an interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental stresses, predisposing certain individuals to psychopathologies during adolescence (Spear, 2010).", "positive": "can make our own dinner and come tonight?

{"anchor": "Executive summary <nl>The following portfolio applies the six-sigma principle (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and control) to ASOS plc. The report begins by identifying which are the most important customer needs by drawing Critical to quality trees and using them to create metrics by which such needs can be identified. The mid-section of the report measures how well ASOS have met the needs expected by its customers and analyses and addresses the core issues behind this using methods such as the 5 why\u2019s and affinity diagrams which aid in drawing out what the overall problem is and areas for improvement. The final sections of the report focus on addressing and eliminating issues by employing the 5\u2019s and process mapping. Lastly overall recommendations are made for ASOS. Please find all relevant diagrams and documents in the Appendix at the end of the text. <nl>Introduction and Background <nl>The company that I have chosen to investigate is A.S.O.S. (Abbreviated for \u2018As Seen on screen\u2019) They are an online fashion and cosmetics retailer, founded in the year 2000 and based in the UK, London. 20 years later, the company now ship their products to 195 countries worldwide and sell over 850 brands on their site, alongside their own range of clothing and accessories. The company employs over 40, 000 s people as a part of this global operation. I chose to look at ASOS because they are a company, I have personal experience as a customer with, as well as knowing other people who have shopped with them also. I also thought it would be interesting to look at a business that operates solely online as this is the future of a lot of commercial activity. <nl>DEFINE (Value Added Case) <nl>The CTQ trees (figure 1) detail what needs are important to me as a customer at ASOS. The needs I identified were; good customer service, quality products and a high-quality website. Good customer service is important to me as there is not a physical store whereby, I can interact with the staff face-to-face or be persuaded by the physical environment to continue returning. Therefore, I can say that the integrity of the brand to me as a customer is dependent to on how well its customer service performs. If an order is not processed correctly, I expect customer services to fix the problem in order for me to decide to purchase from them again. These needs are further established by the following quality drivers; time taken to receive my order and how quickly a response is provided to my enquiries. Again, since the transaction happens online, as a customer I deem the brand more trustworthy if I have a positive experience of my product or <nl>refund consistently received quickly, and communication isn\u2019t slow. This is reassuring to me and suggests that they care about my experience as a customer. I would further break these quality drivers into measurable metrics seen in figure that uphold ASOS to a high standard. If these metrics are followed, ASOS should be able to successfully provide good customer service. <nl>MEASURE (SERVQUAL) <nl>I asked 5 customers to complete a SERVQUAL questionnaire regarding the RATER aspects of ASOS (Basu, 2000), including aspects of the service which are tangible (i.e. clothes and accessories) and intangible (i.e. delivery and refunds). The results of the questionnaire are represented in figure 2, which outline the gap between ASOS \u2019customer expectations and actual perceptions once they have experienced the service and products. According to my results the areas which ASOS need the most improvement are empathy and assurance as they both fall below customer\u2019s expectations of an \u2018excellent online retailer.\u2019 However, the graph shows responsiveness to have low expectations (in comparison to other areas) as well as perceptions. This is significant as I identified responsiveness as quality driver in the CTQ diagram. Although, this also suggests an opportunity for ASOS to be competitive as customers do not have as high an expectation for online retailers to be very responsive based on their past experiences. If ASOS implement this in the next stages of their six-sigma process they may have found a way to increase their competitiveness. The results also highlighted that in both Tangibles and Reliability customer expectations were exceeded, therefore ASOS can be said to have a high-quality performance in these areas. <nl>MEASURE (Cause and Effect Case) <nl>After considering the results of the SERVQUAL questionnaire and the needs highlighted in the CTQ diagram. I have chosen to analyse the causes behind two areas; Slow responses, which was the lowest scoring activity on the questionnaire and a lack of range in sizes as I have friends who have had issues with this when shopping from online retailers such as ASOS. In the diagram (figure 3) I have thought of potential causes for these issues; in order to identify ways to fix the core problems and thus improve the customer experience. Of the causes that I have identified, the most important to me as a customer are the fact that staff are uncertain of how to respond to emails. This is significant because if staff are unsure of how to respond then my query may not get answered quickly or with a response that is unsatisfactory or doesn\u2019t adress what I am asking. The other significant cause is ASOS being slow to re- <nl>stock. This is undesirable as ASOS are a fast fashion retailer, not being able to meet this expectation, defeats the purpose of their business model and would make me look to other retailers in the market. <nl>ANALYSE (5 Why\u2019s and Affinity) <nl>In the next stage of my research I created a flowchart asking the question \u2018why?\u2019 five times to further analyse the issue and conclude a root cause. From this exercise and use of an affinity diagram (figure 5), I identified and was able to group that the root causes were management related. There were internal issues regarding staffing, recruitment, training and time management that could be the cause of difficulties in responding to customer quieres and being slow to re-stock orders. To summarise, ASOS, like other companies in the same industry, often experience high turnover and sometimes can be slow to recruit new people in efforts to try and improve their retention level. ASOS could recruit internally if staff training was prioritised, thus giving staff the confidence to take on management roles when they become newly available. Overall, these issues fall under the responsibility of the Human resources department. With this information I will begin generating some potential solutions to improve the efficiency of the human resources at ASOS. <nl>IMPROVE (6 Hats and 5 S\u2019s) <nl>Following the previous analysis stages, I thought of some plausible solutions to the HR issues that are potentially affecting the level of customer service at ASOS. I adopted the six-hat tool to analyse my options. The best solution I thought of was to outsource training for the marketing staff, primarily those that deal with customer service; however, it is important that all staff in this department have the same training to support each other where short-staffed. The goal of outsourced training would be to instil the confidence of staff and introduce methods of working that improve efficiency, without placing burden on the management staff. Wearing the black hat, (the most powerful), highlighted that ASOS have to be financially able to undertake this and consider which budget this will come from. I also considered whether training would actually make a significant impact or not, using the green hat in response, I decided that specific staff could be asked to undertake the training, if they find the training successful then the training could be extended to more departments. The Six sigma principle \u2018standardise\u2019 can also be applied here by creating posters or handbooks that can be placed around the office as a quick guide to responding to frequent enquiries, leaving time to respond more carefully to more complex enquiries. Circling back to the green hat, a <nl>computer program could be internally developed that scans emails for key words, listing these as quick enquiries to respond to. Above all ASOS should make it a priority to highlight customer service excellence in their company statement to encourage staff internalising these values. \"To win in services, a firm must develop a passion for service quality within the entire workforce.\" (Foster S. Thomas, 2016) <nl>IMPROVE (PDCA) <nl>At this stage the PDCA tool (Basu, 2000) As mentioned in the previous stage, the solution to the lack of training problem would be to outsource training. Therefore, the pilot study would be testing whether outsourced training will improve the efficiency of staff so that they can respond to emails faster. This will be done by giving staff and management a questionnaire that details the task they are least efficient in before training and another after the training to measure improvement. If a significant improvement is seen (large difference between before and after training scores), more employees across the organisation could also undertake the training. One of the considerable risks with the study is the financial ability of ASOS to support the training. In this case, I have chosen this method because it is easily scalable and will not cost much in the beginning but affords all departments time to plan and budget for this opportunity. The RACI chart (figure 7) shows that there is a shared responsibility between the human resources and managers to communicate internally and the responsibility of the training agency to provide a good service. It is also important that human resources consult marketing managers about which staff should undergo the training and make sure that they are informed. There is also accountability on the part of the staff to gain as much as they can from the training as it is primarily for their benefit. <nl>IMPROVE (Process Mapping) <nl>Six sigma process mapping is an effective tool for documenting a series of necessary steps and display of the value stream so that each step can be analysed for value creation (Quality improvement tools, 2018). Documenting process maps before and after changes (figures 8 and 9) highlights where value was created for ASOS\u2019 customer service team. In this case the value created is in the staff training although visually the difference is not vast it demonstrates the effects of training mentioned in the previous section. Staff before training were more likely to ask management and seek approval for their responses, delaying the time customers received an answer, resulting in unsatisfied customers who do not return. <nl>Recommendations <nl>Another useful recommendations I would offer to ASOS would be to continuously update their FAQ (frequently asked questions) section. After successfully dealing with a complex query, consider that this may be useful to other customers and will reduce the workload in the long run as more customers will consult this beforehand. When a clothing item is delivered, the return sheet could also direct them to this page also. The more ASOS can engage and provide help to customers the more that this need for good customer service (as mentioned in the define stage) is being fulfilled.", "positive": "lo,<nl><nl>My timetable only shows 3 modules for this term, after dropping <module1> because of the clash in lectures with <module2>, can I take another module to get the complete required credits (8 modules).<nl><nl><part_NN>.<new>Hi guys,<nl><nl>I'm <part_NN> (the really long name lol)  were all in the same group (<group> ) for <module>, <nl><nl>I don't mind creating a WhatsApp group  so we communicate before the workshop <nl><nl>If that's alright with you, please reply with your number <nl><nl>thanks.<new>Hello, <nl><nl>I had my first <module> session today, however, my name did not appear on the list of groups, but the session was on my timetable. <pers_FN> has asked me to email you about this and has assigned me to group <group> (<organisation>) , which I am also happy with.<nl><nl>My name is <part_NN_SN>  <nl>Student number: <student_number> <nl><nl>thank you.<new>I've just created tables and added fields<nl><nl>pls watch the videos to know how to create the foreign keys and any other info.<nl><nl><part_NN><new>Hi <addr1_FN>, <nl><nl>please, could you sign my action plan and send me times your available. <nl><nl><part_NN><new>Hi <addr1_FN>, <nl><nl>I wasn't able to gt to you between 1 and 2 today, but I should be on campus between 4-7 pm today would I be able to collect my action plan then? <nl><nl>If not, what time are you available tomorrow? <nl><nl><nl><part_NN>.<new>Hi <addr2_FN>, <nl><nl>I just got <pers_FN>'s email that you have my ID card. <nl><nl>I'm flat <house_number> if you could drop it through the post box that would be great <nl><nl><part_NN>.<new>Hey, <nl><nl>Thank you soooo much, just letting you know i got it!!!<nl><nl><part_NN>.<new>Afternoon, <nl><nl>I would like to ask if there is any recruitment for paid jobs on campus for the coming term?

{"anchor": "Regarding the information I have gathered for the CEO's trip to Helsinki, I have managed to find a multitude of things ranging from hotels to souvenir shops for her children. To start of with, the hotel I thought would be the best fit is the Radisson Blu Seaside Hotel, due to the fact it overlooks the scenic Gulf of Finland. The hotel further has access to gyms, saunas and serves traditional and fresh food, only for \u00c2\u00a374 pn. It is only 1.8 miles from the centre. The next place I found for the CEO to have breakfast was Karl Fazer Caf\u00c3\u00a9, where they serve cinnamon buns and all sorts of savoury foods. It is local to the Hotel, being a 7 minute walk or a 5 minute car ride. Next, when looking at museums to explore, 2 stood out. One being, Sea Fortress Suomenlina. This stood out as it is near water, which is what Helsinki is known for, the sea, diverse architecture and their word famous designs. This sightseeing should be around 2-3 hours, and has many castles to visit including historical castles. The second was the Island and Open Air museum, this is more outdoor and is populated by many restaurants. This museum has been described as 'breath-taking', which is why it is also one that stood out. In regards to the souvenir shop, Kankufin Tapa was the highest rated one. This was because of the small homemade souvenirs, which can be easily to transport from different countries. For entertainment purposes, G-Livelab is the best place to go for live music, and for jazz. There is an event happening on the 4th September. Lastly, in relation to food, the restaurant that was highly rated was Kanstan Moljo. Though this is a buffet, it was highly rated because you can try a variety of traditional foods without having to commit to a whole meal. Additionally, it one of the few places that didn't serve solely salmon, there was alternatives such as reindeer meat, moose meat as well pork stew. These will allow for the CEO to not feel as though she is only faced with one option and that being seafood.", "positive": "lo,<nl><nl>Unfortunately, I lost the previous email, so again I am unsure on who to address the letter to.<nl><nl>Many thanks,<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I was wondering if I could  request an application form, in order to apply for the part time student telethon caller job.<nl><nl>Thank you<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I accept the offer.<nl><nl>Many thanks,<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I was wondering what theme <topic> would come under.<nl><nl>Many thanks<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I was wondering for  the presentation on <day>, will we be required to dress formal?<nl><nl>Many thanks<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I have attached the bibliography below.<nl><nl>Thank you <nl><part_FN> <new>Hello,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Initially for my placement, I was meant to be going to <university>, however due to the covid-19 situation this has been cancelled.

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>The topic of research I decided to study is why it\u2019s mostly students who take Humanities and social sciences degrees; specifically, Psychology students, who are interested in East Asian cultures such as Korean culture. This is an interesting topic to explore because me personally and people around me, have experience of studying Psychology and being a part of Korean society and the Japanese and Manga Society at Aston university. Most of the members of Korean society are Psychology undergraduates so I found that quite interesting and wanted to see if there was an actual link between these types of university students and an interest in East Asian culture as many of them join related societies such as the ones mentioned previously or martial arts societies from these specific cultures to develop their interests or to find new hobbies and interests out of curiosity.<nl><nl>My main research question is \u2018What Psychology students\u2019 experiences are in being interested in Korean culture?\u2019 I decided this would be an Interpretative phenomenological study as it focuses on student\u2019s personal experiences and reasonings behind why they chose to study Psychology and why and how they became interested in Korean culture. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) focuses on \"wanting to understand the meaning of human experience\" this suggests that the method is focused on trying to understand and make sense of how people make sense of their experiences. IPA is also an idiographic form of research method as it is \"conducted at the level of the individual case\" so you\u2019re able to \"make specific claims about the individuals studied\" (Sullivan, C. &amp; Forrester, M.,2019). This means that it is more person orientated and allows researchers to look at certain niche groups and create specialised generalisations on specific typesgroups of people. Therefore, I felt like it was a method that was most suited to this topic as the group of people I am studying are quite specific.<nl><nl>I approached the analysis by highlighting points of interest whilst transcribing the audio of my semi-structured interview. After completing the transcription, I went through my highlighted areas and did descriptive summaries on them. I then tried to group the coding to come up with relevant theories and see if anything was contradictory or could be explained further.<nl><nl>Analysis<nl>The key themes I will be discussing in this analysis are relatability and self-discovery, as they constantly came up throughout the interview which allowed me to group multiple parts of discussion into these two themes.<nl><nl>Relatability <nl>I chose relatability as one of the themes because during the interview, my participant Faith (Fake name) mentioned a lot of situations where she felt she could relate to them through her personal experiences. Faith mentioned that true crime, especially rape cases was one of the reasons she became interested in Psychology as it touched her. Being South African, Faith felt like she could relate to the issue of citizens going through the constant threat of gender-based violence against women. A study conducted found that gender inequality was part of the reason why women were more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner or contract HIVAIDS from them. The researchers found and concluded that women with violent and controlling male partners (abusive) were more likely to contract the viruses as those men would force their partners to take part in risky sexual practices (Dunkle et al, 2004). Faith mentioned that prostitution was also illegal in South Africa and again, due to the gender disparities, female sex workers are criminalised, and systems aren\u2019t set in place to protect them from harm. Faith wants to \"help in positive change, treating people like people instead of (.) dehumanising like. [they\u2019ve been though a lot]\". This further supports the claim that sex workers are not treated fairly and due to their nature of work and even based on just their gender, are not protected but even blamed.<nl><nl>Faith feels that Korean culture is respectful, and group orientated, she states that \"with the whole <nl>South Korean culture like they are all like respectful to each other it\u2019s a culturist culturistic culture so <nl>like I really enjoy that\". From this we can infer that Faith is drawn to the group orientated mindset, <nl>however, I am assuming that when she means \u2018culturistic\u2019 she meant collectivist, I did check it by her <nl>to be sure. She feels like South Korean social culture is like South African culture in terms of mutual <nl>respect for the people around you and the collectivism shown amongst people, she mentions that \"I <nl>love working together\" and \"in South Africa you know your neighbours, you know everyone, here <nl>you don\u2019t [know your neighbours] you don\u2019t know your flatmates\" this suggests that she can relate <nl>to Korean culture more than Western culture as they share similar cross-cultural values that she <nl>understands, thus supporting the effect of relatability on her interest in South Korean culture.<nl><nl>Self-discovery<nl>I chose self-discovery as another theme because whilst talking to Faith, I was able to find out that she felt personal connections to some experiences she discussed and felt that they brought out or revitalised parts of her interests or personalities that were previously doormat or overshadowed. <nl>Faith stated that Psychology was her favourite subject during sixth form, and it was the only one she found interesting during A levels \"A levels was like the worst two years of my life\" this suggests that A levels was not an enjoyable time for Faith and further shows how Psychology could have been her favourite subject. She also highlights how her Psychology teacher during that time was really kind and helpful to her \"he helped me like prepare everything to do for uni\" she says now, she does not regret her decision to study Psychology at University all these things combined may have influenced the positive feelings she started to have when first learning Psychology which has led her to pursue it at a higher level.<nl><nl>Faith finds that she is learning more about herself through Psychology even though she believes that \"Psychology involves learning about others\" this suggests that Psychology allows for the personal development of students who study it and gives a chance for them to open their minds and find out about other things that may interest them.<nl><nl>Within the theme of self-discovery, as Faith became more interested in Korean culture, she also became interested in Korean skin care \"South Korea has the best skin care\" this just coincides with the common sentiment of Korean skincare. The country is known worldwide as the plastic surgery capital and for its dermatological research and highly popularised cosmetic culture which includes skin-care routines, this has led to the sale of high quality, mostly affordable products targeted for the skin on the global market (find research stats &amp; qoute). Due to the increased interest in Korean culture, this has also increased accessibility to these things and many media outlets such as Korean music and media, this as a whole, is known as the \u2018Hallyu wave\u2019. Faith also expresses her interests in music and media, specifically K-pop, she expressed that she really enjoyed dancing to K-pop groups songs as she was not able to during secondary school, Korean culture \"has brought back like dancing part of me back\" this suggests that exploring the culture further has allowed her to pursue her interests again. <nl>Faith has also taken an interest in Korean food and feels like the country\u2019s cooking practices have entered her cooking style \"like now I\u2019m starting to cook with like Soy sauce [and all these things]\" this shows how influenced Faith has become by Korean culture and how its seamlessly interwoven into her life. She states that \"everything I do now just leads me to them\", the \u2018them\u2019 being the main interest points of Korean culture for her e.g., dance and cooking. <nl>Faith also found interest in Korean dramas and movies due to recommendations from friends but was <nl>already interested in other foreign shows \"(.) I just got bored of watching Western stuff\" this suggests <nl>Faith\u2019s willingness to consume media and entertainment different to watch she usually consumes, <nl>indicating an open, which was one of the reasons I expressed for the connection of Psychology <nl>students and their interest in Korean culture as Psychology students usually cultivate an open mind <nl>during their degrees.<nl><nl>Through this analysis of the themes, I have been able to conclude that there is a link between <nl>Psychology students\u2019 experiences with interests in Korean culture whilst focusing on Faith and what  <nl>her experiences are. The link is related to the benefits of open mindedness which allows you to find <nl>new interests pr develop old ones that you previously had, especially open mindedness to cultures <nl>different or similar to your own but in another societal setting.", "positive": " <addr12_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Please find attached the participation information sheet and the consent form.

{"anchor": "Expression of emotion is one of the key ways in which humans communicate with one another and this expression is executed in many ways through tone of voice, body language (Medjden et al., 2020), the language we speak (Sun et al., 2020) and most importantly, our facial expressions. To effectively communicate with facial expressions, humans need to be able to correctly recognise these emotions and respond appropriately. Here, the question of what constitutes correct recognition of facial displays of emotion arises. This is achieved when the perceiver recognises the emotion intended by the person expressing the emotion. Thus, according to this definition, correct recognition of emotion is very subjective, proving that recognition of facial displays of emotion is a non-universal process. There are many factors that determine the non-universality of this phenomenon, but for this essay, only three factors will be discussed: 1) culture (Widen et al., 2011), 2) gender (Spies and Sevincer, 2018), and 3) mental illness (Uljaravic and Hamilton, 2013). This essay reviews the literature surrounding these factors and aims to support the argument of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion being non-universal with a wide range of convergent evidence.<nl><nl>The main factor to consider when arguing that recognition of facial displays is not universal is the role of culture. There has been vast amount of research that proves that culture does indeed influence emotion recognition. For example, studies by Widen et al (2011) found that culture influences the recognition of the basic emotions (Ekman and Friesen 1976). They conducted two studies: the first one involved 88 university students from Boston college rating 10 different facial expressions \u2013 first with a free label format and then with a forced-choice format. The second study employed the exact same method, but they increased the list of choices in the forced-choice task to include the three most commonly mentioned states (confused, thinking, suspicious) and a \"none of the above\" option. They found that although there was moderate agreement on the predicted emotion when assessed with forced choice (study 1: 58%; study 2: 42%), there was significantly low agreement when participants were assessed with free labelling (study 1: 18%; study 2: 16%). Therefore, this contrast in agreement in the different conditions possibly suggest that the options presented in a forced choice task may influence and shape their answer, meaning it is not the ideal task type to use when conducting emotion recognition research. Moreover, free labelling tasks have more ecological validity, making them more valid than forced choice tasks. <nl><nl>However, as with any psychological research, this study has limitations. While the researchers made sure to include individuals from various backgrounds in their sample size, the main drawback is that all of the participants had some exposure to Western, US culture as they were all university students at an American university. This means that even participants who maybe were not US citizens, still had been exposed to Western culture to an extent which may have influenced their answers and thus, the data of the culturally diverse participants would not be as accurate as if they had never moved to the US. Therefore, it is important to consider research that has employed participants from non-Western backgrounds. <nl><nl>Neuroimaging research conducted by Harada et al (2020) shows emotion recognition is influenced by culture by showing that neural activity in certain brain areas was different among participants from different ethnic backgrounds and that in-group biases influenced this activity. The study involved 3 groups of participants; native Japanese (JP) individuals who lived in Japan, Caucasian Americans (CA) and Japanese Americans (JA) both of which lived in the US. The study involved an fMRI scan of the participants while they completed an emotional face and perceptual matching task, viewing stimuli of either Japanese or Caucasian faces depicting negative emotions (fear or anger) or simple shapes that served as control. The results of this study show that in-group biases and collectivistic values influence cultural modulation of neural response in the bilateral amygdala. Furthermore, bi-cultural JAs showed enhanced neural responses in the ventral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices during the perception of Japanese negative facial expression which suggests greater sensitivity to ingroup biases in individuals from more than one culture. Thus, this study is a prime example of how culture can shape emotion recognition \u2013 if this was a universal phenomenon, then all participants would have had the same level of neural activity in the amygdala however that was not the case. Furthermore, the researchers also made sure to select participants from collectivist cultures \u2013 those who had never been exposed to individualistic cultures \u2013 which make the data more reliable as it is less likely to be influenced by Western norms. As culture plays a significant role in influencing emotion recognition of facial displays of emotion, credibility to the belief that emotion recognition is non-universal is given.<nl><nl>Another factor to consider when discussing whether correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is a universal process is the role of gender. Research has shown that gender influences emotion perception and recognition among humans. Indeed, a study conducted by Spies and Sevincer (2018) showed that women were much better than men at recognising whether smiles were genuine or not. They used a behavioural experimental paradigm whereby they had participants judge single and adjacent photos. The single photos involved both authentic and unauthentic smiles and participants were required to indicate which smile they thought the photo showed. The adjacent photos involved photos of the same person depicting either an authentic smile or an unauthentic smile. The results showed that women outperformed men in differentiating the two types of smiles in the adjacent photos condition. This therefore suggests that gender does play a role in recognition of facial displays of emotion. <nl><nl>However, it is important to note that this study only explores gender influence in this area in only one type of experimental paradigm \u2013 a forced choice test. An issue with this type of test is that it lacks ecological validity as in real life, people differentiate facial displays of emotion through various means for example, via their eyes. Indeed, a study by Hall et al (2009), using eye tracking techniques, found that women were quicker and more accurate in recognising expressions than men and they looked more at the eyes of the person in the photo stimuli than men. Thus, this study shows that by even using a different experimental technique (other than a forced choice task) gender differences in recognition of facial displays of emotion are still evident. <nl><nl>Mental illnesses also have proven to be an influencing factor in the correct recognition of facial displays of emotion. In a meta-analysis study by Uljarevic and Hamilton (2013), it was found that autistic individuals found it difficult to recognise facial displays of emotion. The systematic review involved 48 papers that all employed a behavioural study paradigm, that is, participants in the study were required to do a type of behavioural task. The results of this meta-analysis found a large negative effect size that suggests the autistic individuals have a general impairment in emotion recognition. <nl><nl>However, it is too presumptive to claim that the findings of this meta-analysis are applicable to other research investigating the role of mental illnesses on recognition of emotions using different experimental paradigms, i.e. those that deal with neuro-psychological data that is obtained through neuro-imaging techniques or other physiological methods. As highlighted before, the above study looked at studies that employed behavioural tasks. It is important to establish whether the findings of that study would still be prevalent when alternative techniques are used. <nl><nl>In support of this, a meta-analysis study conducted by Cuve et al (2018) found similar results to the previous study, but their analysis included physiological and eye-tracking studies. This study involved a review of 21 studies and the results showed that the majority of the studies suggested that individuals with autism show a level of active or reflexive avoidance to the eyes, consequently missing the subtle social cues conveyed through this particular body part. The eyes are a crucial part of the body in that they play a significant role in processing emotional expressions, especially negatives ones such as fear and sadness (Scheller et al 2012). <nl><nl>Therefore, in line with the previous meta-analytic study discussed in this essay, the findings of this study also suggest that individuals with autism struggle recognising facial displays of emotion, especially negative emotion. Thus, with research that strongly supports the notion that mental illnesses play a role in influencing recognition of facial displays of behaviour, the notion that this phenomenon is not universal but rather dependent on many factors is proven to be more credible.<nl><nl>Overall, the non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is widely researched. The factors discussed in this essay all influence emotion recognition of facial displays in distinct ways; it seems individuals from different cultures perceive facial emotions differently, women, more than men, are more likely to correctly recognise facial displays of emotion and autistic individuals generally have a difficulty in distinguishing and thus recognising different emotions. It also important to note that while emotion recognition of faces can involve either positive or negative emotions, it is more often the case that these factors play a bigger role when individuals are required to distinguish between negative faces rather than positive ones. That is, non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is more evident in negative emotions than positive ones.", "positive": "nks for the answers, really clarified a lot of things! <nl><nl> <nl><nl>To decide on the specific personality traits I wish to study, I've summarised the traits that each study looks at in a table.

{"anchor": "Over the last few years EMNE\u2019s have become more prominent within the globalised world we now live in. These firms have had a significant boost since 2002; also referred to as the \u2018going global era.\u2019 They tend to come from emerging, upper-middle income economies and developing countries and use a variety of entry modes such as joint ventures, strategic alliances and wholly owned subsidiaries (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). However, the majority choose to expand rapidly into developed countries using M&amp;A\u2019s and are late movers. A growing number of EMNE\u2019s are starting to dominate certain industries such as banking, telecommunications and engineering and outward FDI from emerging countries is increasing. For example, China has increased its presence within the Fortune 500 between 2004 and 2019; whilst the presence of US firms has started to decrease, showing the ever-growing dominance of EMNE\u2019s (Fortune Global 500, 2004,2019). There\u2019s several firms many of us from the western world may not have realised are owned by EMNE\u2019s, such as Tetley being owned by TATA \u2013 an Indian conglomerate; meaning it owns several different types of businesses and McVitie\u2019s being owned by Turkish EMNE, Yildiz Holding.<nl>This essay will highlight the key differences between MNE\u2019s and EMNE\u2019s and examine how effective current theories are at explaining outward FDI from emerging country multinationals and compare and contrast them to the more recent theories which have been developed; including the LLL model and Springboard theory. Some academics believe these new EMNE\u2019s have different motivations, which don\u2019t necessarily fit in with the traditional theories; whilst others think that these theories can be applied just as effectively as the newer ones. <nl>Key differences between traditional western MNE\u2019s and EMNE\u2019s<nl>Only a decade ago many EMNE\u2019s, which are booming today and challenging some of the most established MNE\u2019s in many industries, were marginal competitors. So how have they managed to do this in such a short space of time and be successful? It\u2019s important to look at the key characteristics of both traditional MNE\u2019s and the newer EMNE\u2019s to see what makes them so different. A main difference is the speed they internationalise. Many traditional MNE\u2019s expand gradually, following the Uppsala model whereby they expand into countries which are psychologically close considering factors such as, geography, shared language and shared cultures. On the other hand, EMNE\u2019s expand at a more accelerated pace. They do this to close the gap between their market reach and the global presence of MNE\u2019s from developed countries (Mathews, 2006). A good example of an EMNE which has expanded rapidly is Chinese firm Huawei. In just five years, despite starting as a domestic firm in 2001, it was operating in over 100 countries by 2006. It did this by providing solid technology at low prices and hiring low cost engineers at 20% of western rates. This allowed them to strongly compete against western MNE\u2019s and expand quickly (Fey et al, 2016). EMNE\u2019s also use latecomer advantage whereby they learn from mistakes of MNE\u2019s already established in the market and do better themselves. MNE\u2019s are essentially used as \u2018guinea pigs.\u2019 With regards to ownership advantages many MNE\u2019s have the required resources available to them internally; making this a big advantage if they were to expand into developing countries. However, EMNE\u2019s are sometimes seen as having weak ownership advantages, but many believe this is debatable as their institutional advantages are so strong and they can also just obtain resources and capabilities through M&amp;A\u2019s; which would naturally upgrade their ownership advantages. <nl>Institutional advantages are another key element to consider when comparing the firms. It\u2019s well documented that traditional MNE\u2019s have struggled significantly in countries with institutional voids as they\u2019re used to political stability; due to coming from countries with highly stable environments. As a result, they don\u2019t have the same experiences to cope with instability in the same way as EMNE\u2019S. New EMNE\u2019s are known to have this as a big advantage over traditional MNE\u2019s, as they\u2019re used to dealing and complying with discretionary and unstable governments in their domestic countries, therefore meaning they\u2019re better prepared to succeed in foreign countries with weak institutional environments (Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Genc, 2008). It\u2019s also believed that if EMNE\u2019s can successfully thrive in unstable developing countries, they most certainly can be successful in stable, developed countries. Finally, there\u2019s key differences in the organisational adaptability of MNE\u2019s versus EMNE\u2019s. It\u2019s believed that EMNE\u2019s are much more adaptable than MNE\u2019s which tend to suffer from inertia, by being stuck in their ways, as they have deeply ingrained values, cultures and organisational structures (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). Consequently, they tend to have lower success rates with M&amp;A\u2019s due to their lack of adaptability - almost two thirds of acquisitions by western firms end in failure, as the acquirer doesn\u2019t give flexibility to the firm acquired. On the other hand, EMNE\u2019s tend to have a high M&amp;A success rate - 67% success rate, as their adaptability is high, and they appreciate the firm they acquire more; due to their lack of global presence. <nl>Existing theories and their relevance<nl>Two major theories which explain the existing ways firms expand overseas successfully are Dunning\u2019s Eclectic Paradigm and the Uppsala Model. Dunning uses OLI theory to explain why firms use outward FDI; suggesting the key advantages as being ownership advantages, location advantages and internalisation advantages. Ownership advantages refer to valuable resources and capabilities a firm offers a country it expands into, which gives them a competitive advantage. Many argue that due to their lack of capabilities and resources, coming from developing countries, EMNE\u2019s can\u2019t satisfy this part of the OLI paradigm. Going by Dunning\u2019s explanation this would mean that they\u2019re unable to engage in outward FDI, however many still do and are proven successful. Furthermore, some believe EMNE\u2019s from developing countries could be considered to have ownership disadvantages, as they lack a well-known image and may not have the ability to compete on the same scale as western MNE\u2019s, who have larger finances and advanced technologies (Fey et al, 2016). In addition, location advantages are required by Dunning to expand overseas effectively; this is what host countries can offer to a firm undertaking FDI there (Dunning, 1979). However, many EMNE\u2019s don\u2019t go abroad to access location advantages, such as lower cost production, lower labour costs or cheaper technology; as they already have this available to them in their domestic markets. For example, many Chinese firms won\u2019t outsource their production to a developed country if they\u2019re to expand their firm into them, because it\u2019s well documented that production and labour within China can be done at a much cheaper cost to say that in the US.  As both ownership advantages and location advantages aren\u2019t satisfied in the OLI paradigm, it makes it possible to say that the theory could become redundant or less relevant as more EMNE\u2019S become successful in developed markets; without having satisfied all three elements within the paradigm. <nl>Secondly, the Uppsala model is another model used to explain the internationalisation of firms. It emphasises how firms go abroad incrementally and increase commitments gradually. This may mean they go into countries close to their domestic market first. A firm may first export to a country, then open an overseas subsidiary and finally build or acquire their own factory abroad as they gain more knowledge about the market and establish their operations. EMNE\u2019S are unfortunately thought to leapfrog some steps outlined above and may even start the internationalisation process by becoming \u2018born global\u2019 and setting up the factory first. According to Eriksson et al (2000), the Uppsala Model is based on the idea that the behaviour of the internationalisation process is path dependent. Path dependence is a process based on the accumulated knowledge from the firm\u2019s past international experience, which directs the firm\u2019s future trajectory (Eriksson et al, 2000). A main concern is that Uppsala explains this path dependence but EMNE\u2019s have no experience in developed countries to use. As a result, they can only use knowledge of developing countries. On the other hand, MNE\u2019s know all about operating in developed markets so are at a bigger advantage. Finally, part of the Uppsala model is the idea of psychic distance - entering countries psychologically close. A main issue with this idea is that EMNE\u2019s may not be able to use psychic distance to enter developed countries because they\u2019re so different in nature. For example, developing countries may have stronger cultural, language, political and legal differences to developed countries. This would also be the case for MNE\u2019s looking to expand into developing countries. <nl>The development of new theories<nl>As time has progressed new theories have been developed to try to explain and analyse how these new EMNE\u2019s have used outward FDI to expand their presence internationally. The reason for creating these theories is because many couldn\u2019t understand how these firms from countries with weaker country specific advantages could compete against the firms from developed countries. At first glance, it appears these EMNE\u2019s have weaker firm specific advantages compared to their western rivals. <nl>The springboard theory was created (Luo and Tung, 2007) to explain why these firms expand so aggressively and the drivers behind this. The theory highlights seven elements. The first being that EMNE\u2019s use their international expansion to compensate for their ownership disadvantages; this means that to counteract the fact they can\u2019t offer a lot initially in terms of resources to the new market, they expand internationally and benefit from other means such as gaining resources from another firm through a M&amp;A. Immediately, this makes the OLI paradigm seem less relevant, as it\u2019s highlighting that they can still be a success without initial ownership advantages. The second element of the theory says that EMNE\u2019s use the international expansion to overcome their latecomer disadvantage; this means that they benefit from being able to see where MNE\u2019s have made mistakes and ensuring they don\u2019t make the same ones. Next, it explains that MNE\u2019s from developing countries use international expansion as a springboard to counter-attack global rivals\u2019 major foothold in their home country market. It also outlines that EMNE\u2019s use outward FDI as a springboard to bypass certain trade barriers, such as quotas and anti-dumping penalties. This means that they go into another developingemerging markets with fewer restrictions. For example, if a Chinese firm were to set up a foreign subsidiary or production in Mexico and then export their good to the US. This again goes against the OLI paradigm as the firm isn\u2019t directly using the location advantages of the US for production in the example above. Instead, they\u2019re choosing to use those of Mexico to then sell in the US. Furthermore, the theory says new emerging MNE\u2019s expand internationally to alleviate domestic institutional constraints. This for example could be if their home country doesn\u2019t have strong patent laws, so they take their product elsewhere to be better protected therefore, benefitting from the county\u2019s location advantage of having stronger patent protection. The final two elements explain that EMNE\u2019s use international expansion to both secure preferential treatment offered by emerging governments and exploit their competitive advantage in other markets. To secure preferential treatment a domestic firm, say an Indian firm, may set up a subsidiary within the UK and then invest back into India to gain the tax benefit and the preferential government treatment. <nl>A second new theory developed is the LLL model (Mathews, 2006). This model has similarities to the Springboard theory in the way it explains why EMNE\u2019s expand and internationalise. However, the key takeaway is that it says EMNE\u2019s go abroad and then they learn. This is a massive contrast to the Uppsala model which emphasises the gradual process of expansion and firms using the knowledge they already possess to expand into markets with similarities, that are psychologically close. Firms going abroad and then learning highlights a more aggressive approach to expansion.  The three L\u2019s in the model stand for linkage, leverage and learning. The linkage element examines the collaborations between EMNE\u2019s and foreign firms through entry modes such as joint ventures, M&amp;A\u2019s and alliances. Leverage explains that EMNE\u2019s exploit global linkages to become \u2018latecomers\u2019 by harnessing resources and cost advantages to compete globally.  The second \u2018L\u2019 really highlights the idea that firms go abroad and then learn from the foreign partners already in the market and demonstrates why Dunning\u2019s theory is less relevant of initially having certain ownership advantages to be successful. Finally, the learning element is the stage where EMNE\u2019s acquire competitive advantages and learn how to compete internationally. Firms don\u2019t need initial advantages necessarily; as they can expand and then learn and therefore become competitive. Overall, this model argues that firms acquire resources and learn over time before internationalisation occurs and the EMNE is integrated into the international activities. <nl>Although these theories have been developed and are more tailored to the new types of EMNE\u2019s, they do still have their drawback such as underestimating the importance of absorption capacity and they go against the path dependence theory; as expressed in the Uppsala model. Finally, it\u2019s clear that the importance of ownership advantages is dismissed; which is a key element in the existing OLI paradigm. <nl>In summary, it\u2019s evident EMNE\u2019s and traditional MNE\u2019s differ both in the way they operate and the way they internationalise. Key differences include the speed EMNE\u2019s internationalise compared with MNE\u2019s and how differently they use or even don\u2019t use their initial ownership advantages to ensure success abroad. Although they have their differences, both types of firm have proven to be successful in their own ways. However, there\u2019s still a huge question mark over how these newer EMNE\u2019s have prevailed so much globally. Thus, newer theories have been developed to try and explain this dominance. It must be said that although these new theories more accurately explain the rapid growth of EMNE\u2019s and why having ownership advantages isn\u2019t as essential as some older theories may suggest; they do still have their criticisms, as explained above. Consequently, further theories may have to be developed which are more accurate and less open to scrutiny. However, it really depends on individual views as to which theories are considered more relevant. Some would argue Dunning and the Uppsala model have been used for many years and can still be used effectively today, whilst others may say the world is constantly changing, as seen with the recent rise of EMNE\u2019s, and therefore it\u2019s necessary to keep developing and updating new theories. This will make them most effective and relevant to the current situations firms and countries find themselves in. For example, Carl Fey and others developed a new 5M framework which guides academics in their understanding of the internationalisation of EMNE\u2019s (Fey et al, 2009). It proved that internationalisation is challenging for any firm. The largest challenge for EMNE\u2019s, which is not always covered by the older theories, is overcoming the problem of a negative country image (Y.Y. Chang et al., 2009; E.Chang &amp; Taylor., 1999; Ferner et al., 2005; Smith &amp; Meiksins, 1995). It\u2019s the job of newer theories to potentially provide insight into how EMNE\u2019\u2019s can overcome this challenge.", "positive": "<addr8_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for the document I believe this will help a lot.<nl><nl>Have a great Christmas!<nl><nl>Kind Regards,<nl><nl><part_FN> <new>Yes thank you <addr1_FN>\ud83d\ude42<nl><nl>Have a great Christmas!<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr1_FN>,<nl><nl>I just had one final question for the <module> essay I forgot to ask during our meeting.<nl><nl>Do you think it would be a good idea to use an example such as the <business> case for the <topic> question?<nl><nl>Many thanks<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr3_FN>,<nl><nl>None of us can seem to access the exam.

{"anchor": "Rational choice theory \u2018deals with the way in which scarcity impinges upon the individual consumer and hence deals with the way in which such an individual makes choices\u2019 (Estrin et al., 2012). The model is \u2018predicated on the notion that individual actors purse goals efficiently\u2019 (Outhwaite et al., 2007). The term Homo Economicus is used to describe consumers and their sole aim of \u2018utility maximisation\u2019 (Fine., 2016). In-kind and unconditional cash transfers can be used by governments to aim to raise utility and welfare of specific groups in an economy. The effectiveness of these methods may depend upon many factors such as the target group of consumers, the area of consumption they aim to impact and the monetary value of the intervention.<nl><nl>An in-kind transfer is a \u2018transfer payment\u2019 that is \u2018made in a specific good or service rather than cash\u2019 (Cengage.com., 2013). There are 3 main types of in-kind transfers; the provision of vouchers such as food stamps, the use of subsidies and providing free access to a good or service, for example, the NHS in the UK. In-kind transfers allocate the benefit provided to specific goods or services, for example, the UK Healthy start scheme provides a targeted group with \u2018vouchers that can only be spent on specific healthy foods\u2019 (Griffith et al., 2018). It was found the impact these vouchers had upon raising utility depended on how highly the consumer values healthy foods. Diagram 1 shows the impact a healthy food voucher has upon infra-marginal consumers.<nl><figure><nl>Infra-marginal consumers already spend more than the vouchers worth on healthy foods as they value these goods highly and therefore a steep indifference curve is used. They are willing to sacrifice a high proportion of other goods to gain a small extra amount of healthy foods. In the diagram, the food voucher is represented by the line A-C. The voucher has caused an increase in utility for the consumer as represented by the rightward shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2. The original point of maximum utility is represented by point X and the new higher maximum utility point is represented by point Y. The provision of food vouchers to infra-marginal consumers has positively impacted utility. Whilst utility has increased, the impact the voucher has had upon these consumers is very \u2018similar to an income-equivalent cash benefit\u2019 (Griffith et al., 2018). This means that providing an unconditional cash transfer to these consumers instead of the vouchers would have a similar effect on utility. They are still likely to spend the additional cash on healthy foods.<nl><nl>On the other hand, distorted consumers do not value healthy foods as highly and therefore the voucher has a different effect upon their utility. Diagram 2 displays the effect of the food voucher upon distorted consumers.<nl><figure><nl>The lower utility received from consuming healthy foods is represented by a flatter indifference curve and this displays the lower marginal rate of substitution. This means that in comparison to diagram 1 the initial maximum utility point X occurs at a much lower quantity of healthy foods. The voucher causes a shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2 and therefore increases the utility from point X to point C. This shows that the vouchers are effective in raising utility for this group of consumers. However, the line C-E represents the cash alternative of the voucher. Here we can see that if these consumers were provided with cash instead of vouchers the higher maximum utility point of Y can be reached. This shows that these consumers are unlikely to purchase healthy foods if provided with a cash alternative to the vouchers. They would instead choose to purchase a variety of other goods and services. For distorted consumers, the food vouchers are less effective in raising utility and the consumers would prefer to receive a cash payment.<nl><nl>Unconditional cash transfer programmes \u2018aim to improve well-being by providing cash to targeted poor households without placing any conditions on the household\u2019s actions\u2019 (Institute for Financial Studies., 2018). Consumers are therefore not restricted on how they spend this money. Providing consumers with additional cash to spend effectively increases their income. The rational choice model assumes that consumers will act rationally and use any additional income to maximise utility. However, behavioural economics challenges this and suggests that the use of labels for these cash payments can influence how the consumer spends this additional money. Behavioural economics \u2018adds elements of psychology to traditional models in an attempt to gain a better understanding of decision making\u2019 (Sloman et al., 2018). For example, the UK Winter Fuel payment is a \u2018cash transfer to older households\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014). \u2018Robust evidence of a behavioural effect of labelling\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014) was found in relation to this unconditional cash transfer. The study found that \u2018on average households spend 47% of the WFP on fuel\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014). This is in comparison to an expected 3% being spent on fuel if the payment was simply treated as cash. Behavioural economic tools such as nudges can be used to alter how consumers spend their income. This is a clear example of nudge theory and shows that \u2018positive reinforcement\u2019 \u2018can persuade people to make a particular choice\u2019 (Sloman et al., 2018). \u2018When a label is attached to a part of their budget, subjects change consumption according to the label\u2019 (Abler et al., 2017). This evidence shows that consumers are responsive to behavioural economic policies and therefore do not always act like Homo Economicus as suggested by the rational choice model.<nl><nl>Overall, rational choice theory suggests that unconditional cash transfers are more effective at raising consumers\u2019 utility. It allows consumers to purchase the goods and services they decide will maximise their own utility. However, in the long run, depending upon the area of consumption being targeted in-kind transfers may be more beneficial for raising overall welfare. For example, the healthy food vouchers provide families with food of a higher quality and that is more beneficial to their health. If they were instead provided with cash, as the distorted consumer example shows, there is a chance that this money would not be spend on healthy foods and instead it may be used to purchase fast food alternatives. This is then likely to have a long-term impact on health and could contribute to strains on the healthcare system in the future. If unconditional cash transfers are to be used, behavioural economic approaches can be adopted to influence how consumers spend this money to enable the intervention to have the most desired impact.", "positive": "ess you have my birth certificate easily accessible?

{"anchor": "Subsequent to losing the 1983 election on a hardline socialist programme, it became clear that a rebranding of the Labour Party was crucial. The term \"New Labour\" was initially coined by Tony Blair at the 1994 Labour Party Conference, inspired by sociologist Anthony Giddens who believed that it was important to find a \"third way\" between Thatcherism and traditional socialism. The question in hand explores the way in which the Labour Party\u2019s place on the political spectrum has changed through the complexities of several policies introduced over the years. In this essay, I will be assessing the extent to which the Labour Party has been redefined from the Blair-era over two decades ago, to Corbynism today. It is worthwhile dealing with the topic at hand as politics is a subject which needs to be continuously adapting to reflect changes in global dynamics, this topic in particular reveals how government policies develop to maintain dialogue and preserve stability in an increasingly fragile and threatened geopolitical system.<nl><nl>Blair\u2019s creation of New Labour attempted to formulate an alternative to traditional social democracy and free-market neo-liberalism in the context of a modern globalised economy. This neo-revisionism advocated a balance of rights and responsibilities, resulting in communitarian liberalism which emphasised that personal autonomy operates within a communal context based on mutual dependence and benefit. As Brown\u2019s government ensured no radical breakaway from New Labour, ideals and principles of the Labour Party remained the same for many years. However, it is important to note that the Labour government\u2019s failures in the early 21st century appear to have fundamentally changed voters\u2019 views on whether Labour can be trusted on the economy, leading to a Conservative victory in the 2010 general election. This is largely significant as throughout the recent years, the Labour Party seems to have adopted more socialist principles, evident in Corbyn\u2019s left-wing agenda. Therefore, I aim to argue that the Labour party has evolved to a large extent over the years due to many successes and failures of the party leaders\u2019 policies.<nl><nl>In this essay I have used a range of books, websites and JSTOR journals. Previously published academic works include New Labour Hard Labour? Restructuring and resistance in the welfare industry by Gerry Mooney and Alex Law, as well as books such as Leadership and the Labour Party by John Gaffney. In these sources, the key concepts are focussing on New Labours\u2019 appeal to the masses and rebranding of the party. These journals and books gave clear statistics taking an innovative approach as well as differing opinions on the main policies which redefined the Labour Party which provided useful insight and information. To gain better understanding of the authors to ensure reliability of my resources I also did some prior research on them. There were many crossovers to other academic disciplines such as economics and history, especially when researching Blair and Brown\u2019s economic policies there were many statistics and economic theory. However, there were also weaknesses in the sources I used such as the author\u2019s personal opinion being a large influence.<nl><nl>After four general election defeats, the Labour Party realised that traditional class-based political ideas and concepts were no longer seen as acceptable by the British electorate. As a result, the New Labour governments aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations, by conserving resources before investing more in key public services. Blair modernised the Labour party to appeal more to middle-class voters by moving away from traditional policies such as nationalisation and emphasising constitutional reform. \u2018Clause IV\u2019 of the party constitution was abandoned, ties with trade unions were loosened and the party moved away from its previously hard-left position. Labour also became more pro-European as the EU adopted policies that protected workers\u2019 rights such as the Social Chapter, and the Third way brought market models to some government-run services and aroused interest across the western world. Labour policies were largely based around the free-market, which was accepted as the best form of wealth creation with further privatisation and reduced corporate taxes to encourage enterprise. Greater emphasis was placed on individualism and communitarianism with the belief that the individual should realise their own potential and that everyone has a responsibility to care for the community collectively. Moreover, \"as part of its wider reform of the welfare and modernisation agendas, New Labour [had] sought to emphasise the role and responsibilities of family and community in the provision of welfare services\" (Mooney, 2007). Here it is evident that the sole focus of neo-revisionism was essentially a Labour rebranding exercise to appeal to the masses and attract business interests following four consecutive UK general election defeats, it introduced important measures that promoted social justice and improved the position of the most disadvantaged in society. The government had aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations and had done so very well.<nl><nl>This rebranded party proved to be largely successful for the first few years and the idea of the \"Third way\" appealed largely to the masses, however over time, Blair\u2019s popularity began to decline. Although the Conservatives lost the 2001 election, they persisted in arguing that New Labour wasn\u2019t delivering its policy promises. This began to prove effective as there was a significant fall in the number of people who expected service delivery to either get better or much better over the next few years as \"healthcare by September 2003 8 per cent fewer people expected the NHS to \u2018get better\u2019 over the following year. At the same time, the government\u2019s satisfaction ratings fell sharply from a 54 per cent in September 2001, to 36 per cent in September 2002 and 25 per cent in September 2003\" (Hindmoor, 2005). There are many reasons as to why this happened, the main being the tragedy of Iraq which ensnared him so completely that by Summer of 2007 he had acknowledged he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. It is believed that \"Iraq [had] come to dominate the Blair legacy to such an extent that many of his notable achievements \u2013 the Good Friday agreement, devolution to Scotland and Wales, the minimum wage and a number of social reforms are doomed to shelter under its shadow\" (BBC News, 2019). As a combined result of the\u00a0Blair\u2013Brown pact, Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour Party for\u00a0Blair\u00a0to resign and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election.<nl><nl>The Financial crisis and recession of 2008-09 led to a minor shift in policy by the Brown government but still maintained a majority of the New Labour values and principles. Gordon Brown had primacy over vast areas of domestic policy and handled the banking collapse, as the unpopularity of the Iraq war had meant that a new focus was needed for the party. In its foreign policy choices, the Brown government was quite similar to that of Tony Blair\u2019s as it \"displayed the same unshakeable Atlanticism, pronounced Euroscepticism, and commitment to increasing international aid to 0.7% of gross national income as its coalition successor\" (Lee, 2019). In both health and education, \"Brown continued the Blair governments\u2019 pattern of top-down reorganisation of hospitals and schools, and the increasing use of private sector finance and organisations to deliver services\" (Lee, 2019). He supported increased spending on hospitals, pledged to make reform of the NHS a major priority and also promised to retain the public-sector reforms implemented by Blair. In domestic policy terms, the impact of devolution meant that the Brown government\u2019s capacity to reform public services was confined to England, where Brown had no personal democratic mandate to intervene.<nl><nl>Although, Brown retained a vast majority of Blair\u2019s policies, he set out plans to decentralise Britain and make good the more evident weaknesses of Blairism, not least its careless disregard for civil liberties. However, two developments quickly derailed the new prime minister\u2019s hopes. In \"August 2007 the first cracks appeared in the international banking system, cracks that would lead to the run on the Northern Rock bank the first run on a bank in Britain for 150 years \u2013 and its eventual nationalisation by New Labour \u2013 an irony after years of pro-business rhetoric\" (White, 2019). After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a recession in 2008 leading to poor results in the\u00a0local\u00a0and European elections in 2009. Brown had broken an earlier promise not to raise income tax levels by creating a new 50% band, to be paid by those who earned more than \u00a3150,000 a year which led to claims that New Labour ideology had been abandoned. <nl><nl>Despite a Conservative rule, Ed Miliband struggled to balance his more left-wing views with a desire to appeal to the centre ground. Under his leadership the Labour Party maintained some elements of New Labour policies, while shifting slightly to the left. The new leader called for the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax and the need to re-establish Labour\u2019s reputation as a competent manager of the economy was an important concern for Miliband. He tried to combine New Labour\u2019s support for business with the defence of the party\u2019s core working-class constituency by drawing a distinction between what he called \u2018predatory\u2019 and \u2018responsible capitalism. At the 2015 election Miliband pledged to reduce the deficit every year of the next parliament. He insisted that Labour\u2019s spending plans would be paid for without additional borrowing. \"Miliband [pledged] to fund the NHS improvements with a mansion tax on properties worth over \u00a32m. other tax pledges include the restoration of the 10p tax band for low earners\" (The Independent, 2019). However, by 2015 there was pressure from the left of the party for Labour to adopt a much more radical approach. Some party member attributed the landslide victory of the SNP in Scotland, where Labour was left with just one Westminster seat, to the party being insufficiently left wing.<nl><nl>\"Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two\" (BBC News, 2019). Jeremy Corbyn sinisterly told photographers and journalists \"under Socialism you will all cooperate\" (Express.co.uk, 2019) suggesting a radical shift to the left. He took the Miliband-balls idea of increased investment in the economy further, calling for large-scale funding of industry and infrastructure organised by a National Investment Bank. He called for the renationalisation of the railways, a policy the New Labour governments refused to adopt. Instinctively supporting intervention of an Old Labour kind, he demanded that companies publish pay audits with the aim of countering discrimination in the workplace. \"Labour has pledged to rejuvenate the UK's neglected high streets, nationalize public services and some major industries, and force all large firms to give their employees a share of the business and a voice on their boards. Critics of Labour say these policies are throwbacks to failed socialist governments of the 1970s\" (Vonberg, 2019). Like Miliband, he favoured the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax. However, Corbyn was much more clear-cut in his competition to austerity, characterising it as a political choice that harmed the most vulnerable members of society, rather than an economic necessity. Many bold claims have been made about Corbyn with \"Corbyn may not be a Communist, but he\u2019s certainly a Marxist\" (The Northern Echo, 2019) being one of the boldest. Corbyn strongly opposed benefit cuts and a socialist he regarded the poor as the victims of capitalism, who are entitled to public support. He opposed the use of the private sector to deliver public services \u2013 a central aspect of New Labour. Thus, he argued for a wholly state-run NHS. In order to promote lifelong education and training, he called for a national education service, and opposed student tuition fees. By contrast, Ed Miliband had confined himself to advocating their reduction from \u00a39,000 to \u00a36,000 a year. In terms of law and order policy, Corbyn was opposed to the more hard-line policies of the New Labour era, such as increased powers to combat terrorism and the introduction of identity cards. This became a less controversial policy area within the labour party \u2013 both Blairites and Corbynites found common ground in opposing government cuts to police number. Corbyn consistently voted against the use of force and favoured the withdrawal of the UK from NATO\u2019s military structure and the abolition of the Trident nuclear weapons system, again placing him at odds with New Labour. `He followed the mainstream of his party in supporting continued British membership of the EU, emphasising its positive role in protecting workers\u2019 rights.<nl><nl>In conclusion, it is evident that the Labour Party had been redefined to a large extent, beginning as a more centrist party in 1997 and eventually becoming a more radical socialist party in present day. Through several policy failures, the Labour Party established that it needed to rebrand itself once again to adapt to current affairs. It is evident that Gordon Brown maintained a large amount of the New Labour principles however, Ed Miliband realised that this new and reformed party wasn\u2019t going to get them through the 2015 election. This resulted in more left-wing agendas being proposed and the Labour Party promoting themselves as a more socialist organisation. Thus, to conclude, the Labour Party has been redefined to a large extent with several shifts throughout the political spectrum over the years.", "positive": "lo<new>Can u lmk if ur going bullring today pls<new>So I don\u2019t have to take a trip alone LOOOOL<new>What are they called<new>I am going primark<new>You may see me tmo tho<new>I can come to town before u go<new>Okay I\u2019ll come with you again tmo<new>I\u2019ll check for you today<new>It\u2019s <day> so hopefully a while<new>And lockdown being enforced <day> hopefully<new>Not <day><new>So should be okay x<new>Bc I\u2019ll stay with you<new>Until your train<new>And then come back x<new><addr1_FN><new><addr1_FN><new>Guess who my flatmates is<new><pers_FN><new>I live<new>With <pers_FN><new><addr1_FN><new>I can\u2019t<new>Both of them<new>Hate my life", "attacked": "lo<new>Can u lmk if ur going bullring today pls<new>So I don\u2019t have to select a trip alone LOOOOL<new>What are they called<new>I am going primark<young>You may see me tmo tho<new>I can come to town before u go<new>Okay I\u2019ll come with you again tmo<new>I\u2019ll check for you today<new>It\u2019s <day> so hopefully a while<new>And lockdown being impose <day> hopefully<new>Not <day><new>So should be okay x<new>Bc I\u2019ll stay with you<new>Until your train<new>And then come back x<new><addr1_FN><new><addr1_FN><new>Guess who my flatmates is<new><pers_FN><new>I live<new>With <pers_FN><new><addr1_FN><new>I can\u2019t<unexampled>Both of them<new>Detest my life", "attack_type": "synonym_replacement", "replacement_rate": 0.15, "stats": {"n_original_words": 82, "n_attacked_words": 82, "n_changed": 5, "change_rate": 0.061}}

{"anchor": "The case, Smith, was heard in the Courts Martial Appeal Court on 25th March 1959. The defendant, a private soldier named Thomas Joseph Smith, stabbed three of his comrades during a fight, with a bayonet in the army regiment barracks. One individual had two bayonet wounds which \u2018pierced a lung and caused a haemorrhage\u2019. On his way to the medical reception, the victim was dropped twice. Moreover, he then received incorrect medical treatment, and was negligently treated by the medical staff who failed to diagnose the puncture. The victim died, leading the defendant to be convicted with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, in relevance to s.1 Offences Against the Person Act 1861. <nl>The regimental sergeant-major \u2018put his company on parade\u2019 after the fight, detaining them until someone confessed. Smith, as a result, admitted to the stabbing at the parade. The following day, Smith was visited by a sergeant from the Special Investigations Branch who administered a caution and requested for a written admission. Both statements were given as evidence at the trial. <nl>The issue lies in the argument of who is liable for the death of the victim, whether it was due to the negligence of the doctor or the defendant\u2019s actions of stabbing the victim in the army barracks. The relevant law for murder is actus reus, which is unlawful killing, and mens rea, which is the intention to kill or cause GBH. The defendant satisfies both, as his act of stabbing the victim led to the consequence of his death (results crime). Smith also had indirect intention, as he may not have wished for the given outcome, but it was virtually certain to occur because of his actions. It can be said that he committed voluntary conduct of actus reus as he did have control over his actions. This can be supported by Lord Denning\u2019s statement, \u2018the requirement that it should be a voluntary act is essential, not only in a murder case, but also in every criminal case as no act is punishable if it is done involuntarily\u2019 in Bratty.<nl>The defendant claimed the soldier did not instantly die, it was rather the injuries encountered on his journey to receive medical attention, and the doctor mistreating him which caused his death. The doctor had a duty of care to attend to the necessary needs of the patient, which did not occur as he was given artificial respiration after a failure of saline solution transfusion, which arguably contributed to his death as \u2018the treatment that he was given was thoroughly bad\u2019. The duty of care \u2018was breached, and as a direct result of the breach, the patient suffered harm\u2019. This is supported by Dr. Camps, who provided evidence for the defence and stated the victim\u2019s chances of improvement were \u2018as high as 75 per cent\u2019. <nl>Furthermore, the defendant appealed that the alleged confessions were wrongly admitted as evidence. Represented by Roderic Bowen QC and H.K Woolf, it was argued on his behalf that the \u2018first admission was inadmissible\u2019 primarily due to the proceedings being soiled from the threat posed by the sergeant-major. Arguably, this was conceded further in the second admission made as the order persisted, therefore the fear of threat concludes the confession to be involuntary. It was reminded to the court that the relationship between the individuals must be considered as the young soldier is obliged to follow the orders of his major, so he had to obey the orders given. <nl>The Crown, represented by E. Garth Moore, stated that the threats posed \u2018were not directed to the accused alone, but to a whole company\u2019 so the first admission can be addressed as admissible. It was explained that the sanction was so trivial that it would be \u2018almost an abuse of language to call it a threat\u2019. The s.36(1) Medical Act 1983 states if a fully registered person is judged by the Professional Conduct Committee to have been guilty of serious professional misconduct while registered or not, the Committee may direct that his name shall be erased from the register, which the medical staff are faced with in this case. With such a severe consequence, it can be argued that the medical staff ensured they were accurate in their actions to uphold professional conduct. Furthermore, the action of the third party involved, the medical staff, performed a reasonable response to the defendant\u2019s original act. Despite reducing chances of recovery, it is argued that their act did not break the chain of causation because it was not \u2018free, voluntary and informed\u2019, as said in Pagett. <nl>In Cheshire, the defendant \u2018shot the victim in the thigh and stomach, the wounds necessitated surgery from which he developed breathing difficulties\u2019, for which he had to have tracheotomy. Due to rare complications in surgery, the victim died. Although, the \u2018complication was a direct consequence of the appellant\u2019s acts which remained a significant cause\u2019 to the death of the victim, it was concluded, using precedents from the case of R v Smith, that there was no break in the chain of causation. The judge told the jury that if they find the chain of causation to be broken, they must believe that \u2018the medical treatment or lack of it was reckless in the sense that those administering it were careless of the consequences\u2019. It was concluded that the defendant\u2019s actions were still an operating and substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death, therefore the appeal was dismissed. This differs to Jordan where the victim was given antibiotics to deal with stab wounds, however he had an allergic reaction due to the doctor\u2019s misconduct of not thoroughly checking records, and he died. The court, in this case, concluded that the defendant\u2019s actions did satisfy novus actus interviens, so the chain of causation was broken. Byrne J, stated that the death was not \u2018consequent upon the wound inflicted\u2019, but for the actions of the defendant. <nl>In the present case, the court concluded the encountered negligence received does not break the chain of causation, and it is the fault of the defendant for the victim\u2019s death. Lord Parker CJ, one of the three judges of the case, stated that the action undertaken by the sergeant-major was appropriate. While what was said by the regimental sergeant-major was a threat, it assisted to provide further information for inquiries to be made. He stated that an individual\u2019s confession beyond the court is solely admissible if voluntary, therefore Smith\u2019s first admission cannot be acceptable. On the other hand, the second statement is admissible as \u2018it is clear that the effect of any original inducement or threat under which the first statement was made had been dissipated\u2019. Furthermore, when the second confession was made, the circumstances were different such as the passing of nine hours, the parade had ended, and the threat was spent. The change in circumstances alters the validity of the admissions therefore it is acceptable for the second confession to be addressed as admissible. <nl>According to Lord Parker CJ, \u2018if at the time of death, the original wound is still an operating cause and a substantial cause, then the death can properly be said to be the result of the wound, albeit that some other cause of death is also operating\u2019. It could not be due to the medical negligence faced, as \u2018an original wounding is the only reason that treatment and presence in a hospital would be required\u2019. Based on this, it can be disputed that despite the series of unfortunate events after the stabbing, the death only occurred due to the original stabbing from Smith, so the \u2018wound was still an operating cause and a substantial cause of death\u2019. The victim would not be in hospital but for the stabbing, so it would be reasonable to conclude that the stabbing was the reason for his death, satisfying factual causation. This principle upheld the conviction, and the court dismissed the appeal.", "positive": "<addr2_FN>, <nl><nl>I hope you are well.

{"anchor": "\"Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (Hodges et al, 2020). A diagnosis of ASD according to the DSM-IV-TR entails a minimum of two social impairments, one communication and one in restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) (American Psychiatric association, 1994). The \u2018Big 3\u2019 psychological theories are Theory of Mind (ToM); Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and executive dysfunction (ED).<nl>ToM is the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others (Tager-Flusberg, 2006). 80% of children with ASD, failed the Sally Anne false belief task (which investigates ToM) (Baren-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1985) compared to typically developing (TD) children. However, 20% of children still passed. This doesn\u2019t account for performances by higher-functioning individuals with autism (HFAI), as Happe (1995) states passing false-belief tasks are predicted by verbal mental age. Furthermore, Happe\u2019s 1994 strange stories test found individuals with autism (IWA) showed difficulties with irony, sarcasm, and metaphors. This can account for social and communicative impairments such as sustaininginitiating 2-way conversations, subsequently causing  failure to develop peer relationships. However, this may be due to under-connectivity in left-hemispheres (Verley et al, 2014). In addition, IWA also showed difficulty in reading eyes tasks (Baren-Cohen et al, 2001), which suggests impairments of joint attention (JA). Furthermore, children with autism, have impairments in following eyes andor giving appropriate eye contact (Neumann, 2006), as well as issues using declarative gestures. Baron-Cohen (1994) stated this was due to a deficit in shared attention, according to mind-reading system. This can explain social and communication impairments e.g., lack of shared enjoyment and failure to use non-verbal behaviours. However, ToM fails to account for RRB such as a tendency for routinesrules and circumscribed interests. <nl>ED involves deficits in planning, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). IWA show poor cognitive flexibility in the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) (Nelson, 1976). This can be due to perseverative behaviour. However, Minshew et al (1992) found perseverative ability is linked to verbal IQ as they found no differences between TD and HFAI. Thus, ED cannot solely and universally explain deficits. Furthermore, IWA have planning deficits illustrated in Tower of Hanoi task (Ozonoff &amp; Jensen, 1999). However, Hughes (1996) found IWA were able to do puzzles requiring  fewer steps. Although planning isn\u2019t completely impaired, disruption of routinesrules causes distress to IWA (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).<nl>Studies aforementioned do not account for individual differences, as performances may be different in HFAI due to  Verbal IQ. Furthermore, ED also occurs in individuals with schizophrenia and Tourette\u2019s who perform similarly to IWA on executive function tests (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).  This limits the potential of ED as a diagnostic marker for ASD. <nl>The Weak Central Coherence theory (WCC) (Frith, 1989) states IWA possess a bias towards local elements. Evidence for this is in embedded figures (Witkin, 1971) and block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983), in which children with ASD displayed superior performance. Furthermore, Happe (1996) found IWA weren\u2019t susceptible to visual illusions. These local biases can account for IWA showing pre-occupations for parts of objects. In further support, Hobson &amp; Lee (1998) found IWA do not process faces as a whole as they weren\u2019t susceptible to inversion effect, due to this local bias processing. Furthermore, IWA show activity in primary visual cortex, linked to perception (Chung &amp; Son, 2020) which can explain performances, therefore, WCC isn\u2019t a sole explanation for superior performances. Frith &amp; Snowling (1983) found IWA failed to use appropriate associations on homograph tasks, as they focused on sole words instead of the whole context, further supporting WCC. This can explain social communicative impairments such as sustaining conversation or developing relationships. Although, Lopez &amp; Leekam (2003) found IWA were able to use appropriate word associations in their visual homograph task suggesting such deficits are sensitive to task modalities.  <nl>In conclusion, the \u2018Big 3\u2019 psychological theories contribute to the ASD clinical profile to an extent.  ToM can account for social and communicative impairments, but not universally, as well as inability to explain RRB. Although, EDT can account for RRB i.e., adherence to routinesrules, is not exclusive to ASD. The WCC accounts for social and non-social behaviours but brain regions also play a role. This shows ASD is a multiple deficit disorder without a one theory fits all. The fractionation theory suggests the 3 domains are distinct at a cognitive level (Happe &amp; Ronald, 2008), but Russell et al (1991) states there is overlap between all domains highlighted in performances and theories, thus further research is need on domain specificity.<nl><nl><question2><nl>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical behaviours compared to typically developing individuals (TD). Lower-level processes such as  enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF); social motivational theory (SMT) and spontaneous mimicry (SM) may account for such differences.<nl>Evidence for EPF arises from embedded figures task (Witkin et al, 1971), as well as block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983) in which children with ASD show superior performance to TD. In block design tasks, children with autism also show no further advantage to pre-segmented designs. This is due to perceptual processes being enhanced in ASD, which leads to locally orientateddetailed focused perception, compared to weak central coherence (WCC) which outlines a bias towards local elements (Charman et al, 2013). Thus, EPF highlights superiority in perceptual processing compared to processing style in WCC. Furthermore, IWA perform faster than TD children on conjunctive visual search tasks (Plaisted, O\u2019Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) which further supports IWA have enhanced perceptual discrimination (Plaisted, O\u2019Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) as EPF enables IWA to discriminate against colours and features resulting  in this faster processing. <nl>EPF can also explain savant skills, which are more common in ASD than the general population (Mottron et al, 2006), which highlights strengths of ASD. For example, exceptional drawing skills are due to EPF, as this encourages IWA to avoid perceptual closure, leading to more accurate and detailed focused drawings (Chamberlain et al, 2013). However, EPF doesn\u2019t explain why this only occurs in some IWA, as there may be individual variations in processing perceptual information. <nl>EPF can also explain atypicality in sensory symptoms in IWA. Due to this enhanced perceptual processing, the threshold of detecting sensations is lowered (Lawson et al, 2015). However, Triomphe et al (2019) found IWA have atypical Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation (linked to inhibition) which also explains tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Therefore, EPF isn\u2019t a sole explanation of why hypersensitivity occurs in IWA. Another limitation is EPF fails to explain why hyposensitivity occurs, and thus has weak explanatory power regarding sensory processing. <nl>Another low-level process in ASD is SM.  In electromyography responses in IWA, SM of emotional expressions is shown to be atypical (Beall et al, 2008) andor delayed (Oberman, Winkielman &amp; Ramachandran, 2009). SM is important for socio-emotional reciprocity, as Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found being mimicked makes people like us more. SM also underlies empathy (Drimalla et al, 2019). Therefore, this can explain impairments in developing relationships in ASD as well as a  lack of shared enjoyment displayed in ASD as IWA prefer to play on their own (Chevallier et al, 2012). <nl>The SMT explains deficits in social cognition related to lower-level processes.  Eye-tracking experiments by Klin et al (2002) found children with ASD look more at the background than characters in static social photographs. Furthermore, Vlamings et al (2010) found IWA have impairments in processing and identifying faces. According to EPF, this is due to enhanced processing of high spatial frequency information, an atypical process focusing on fine perceptual detail. However, the SMT states IWA  have less motivation to attend to faces as it is less rewarding, and this lack of experience can lead to poorer processing (Chevallier et al, 2012).<nl>Furthermore, Chamberlain, Rothman-Fuller and Kasari (2007) found children with ASD prefer isolated tasks compared to collaborative. Chevallier et al (2012) found this is due to selective social anhedonia (inability to feel social pleasure) in adolescents with ASD and this correlates with ASD severity. This explains impaired initiating and responding to in children with ASD in joint attention.   <nl>In conclusion, the above theories can contribute to atypical differences in ASD. EPF can explain atypical differences at a social and non-social level in ASD. SMT involves deficits in orienting to social information and behaviours which maintain social interaction (Chevallier et al, 2012), explaining social and communication impairments. Although, this cannot account for atypical restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) shown in IWA. In addition, despite SM being able to explain atypical social behaviours, it fails to explain communication and RRB. Failing to  account for a whole domain shown in IWA entirely shows serious limitations in using these theories for an explanatory power of the full ASD clinical profile. Furthermore, evidence given in support of these studies are task-dependent and artificial, such as eye-tracking and facial processing experiments as they do not reflect real-life settings. Likewise, lab studies lack validity and therefore may not be extrapolated. The above theories aren\u2019t universal across all IWA as individual variations occur due to it being a spectrum disorder, as well as co-morbidity.

Further research needs to be conducted on individual variations on atypical differences.<nl><nl><question4><nl>Apraxia of speech (AoS) is an acquired motor speech disorder (Ballard, Granier &amp; Robin, 2000). Phonological representation is intact and there is no difficulty in motor realization, but there is an impairment in converting representations into a motor plan; this results in but isn\u2019t limited to; phonological and phonetic speech errors, distorted prosody and groping (visibleauditory attempts to find right position for articulators) (Galluzzi et al, 2015). There are many accounts regarding the cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia which I will compare and contrast.<nl>Firstly, there is an impairment in knowledge, specifically, a loss of knowledge of word-sized articulatory programmes. The hypothesis states there is damage to a direct word route which impairs retrieval for articulatory planning. Instead, speakers have to use a less efficient, laborious route. Varley and Whiteside (2001) state some apraxic speakers (AS) have lost the ability to access stored plans and thus assemble speech from smaller units, which causes dysfluency shown in AoS. Furthermore, Varley, Whiteside &amp; Luff (1999) found there were no frequency effects in word durations with 4 AS. However, results weren\u2019t significant. Contrastingly, Aichert and Ziegler (2004) propose brain damage in apraxia causes a loss of lower frequency routes and perseverations of higher frequency ones. This is consistent with a similar notion AS have an impairment in knowledge of the spatio-temporal parameters associated with speech, such as word retrieval in speech production,  which has also led to imprecise motor planning (Shriberg, Aram &amp; Kwiatkowski, 1997). Ziegler &amp; Cramon (1986) support this as they found AS have difficulties in knowing which parameters to use or knowing timings of lowering the velum, which can cause phonetic errors.  <nl>The reduced buffer capacity hypothesis (RBCH) is another account of cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia (Rogers and Storkel, 1999). Firstly, a limitation in the articulatory output buffer which is involved in phoneme-articulatory conversion. The speech motor buffer can only fit one syllable at a time; this can account for syllabic segregation, false stops, and  pauses between syllablesconsonants in AS. This means AS can\u2019t activate several speech motor programmes simultaneously (Galluzzi et al, 2015). Secondly, there is reduced efficiency of the articulatory planner as the process of phonological to auditory conversion has become slower andor less precise (Buchwald &amp; Miozzo 2012), similar to the hypothesis above. This accounts for slower speech shown in AS with impreciseness explaining phonetic errors produced. In addition, RBCH states speakers may simplify consonants as they are more difficult to produce e.g., CCV template to CV template  (Bernhardt &amp; Stemberger, 1998). Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) support this as they found AS had longer reaction times (RT) when producing alternating syllables and use simplification to reduce complexity. This explains pauses between syllable and phonemes, and consonant elongations. Both studies however have small sample sizes and aren\u2019t generalisable across all AoS speakers. <nl>The program retrieval deficit hypothesis (PRDH) however states cognitive difficulties in AoS is due to interference in accessing articulatory plans. There is competition amongst motor programmesplans for selection due to similarity, and this generates errors and dysfluency in AoS (Mailend et al, 2019). This is supported by Mailend &amp; Maas (2013) who found AS showed significantly longer RT to say a pre-specified word when distractors were presented. Moreover, Galluzzi et al (2015) found frequency effects may be due to errors of selection due to an intrusion of phonetic  competitors; this interference activates corresponding phonetic words. In another study Mailend et al (2019) contrasted RBCH with PRDH. AS in their study were expected to show longer RT when prime and target words were different compared to identical (switch-costs). They found the switch-cost was more significant compared to other groups, as predicted by the PRDH, not the RBCH. However, this may be  due to participants knowing the target prior, which could jumpstart activation or from interference from competitors activated by the prime. Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) found AS took longer to initiate two different syllables \u2018da-ba\u2019 compared to identical syllable sequence (da-da), which RBCH cannot explain as the \u2018da\u2019 is loaded to the buffer first and identical. <nl>In conclusion, there are numerous accounts explaining cognitive difficulties in AoS. All accounts above can propose for groping and have similaritiescontrasts of their perspectives of why impairments occur in AS.  However, experimental tasks aforementioned are limited as results may differ ranging from the severity of impairments, as brain damage and addition of Aphasia in some speakers could yield different results. Therefore, there isn\u2019t one account which can explain all cognitive difficulties of AoS as results for experiments are inconsistent. Further research into the different hypothesis\u2019 can help tailor treatments for AS.\"", "positive": "<addr5_FN>,<nl>I had a question I had completely forgotten about regarding the placement assignment.

{"anchor": "Rational choice theory \u2018deals with the way in which scarcity impinges upon the individual consumer and hence deals with the way in which such an individual makes choices\u2019 (Estrin et al., 2012). The model is \u2018predicated on the notion that individual actors purse goals efficiently\u2019 (Outhwaite et al., 2007). The term Homo Economicus is used to describe consumers and their sole aim of \u2018utility maximisation\u2019 (Fine., 2016). In-kind and unconditional cash transfers can be used by governments to aim to raise utility and welfare of specific groups in an economy. The effectiveness of these methods may depend upon many factors such as the target group of consumers, the area of consumption they aim to impact and the monetary value of the intervention.<nl><nl>An in-kind transfer is a \u2018transfer payment\u2019 that is \u2018made in a specific good or service rather than cash\u2019 (Cengage.com., 2013). There are 3 main types of in-kind transfers; the provision of vouchers such as food stamps, the use of subsidies and providing free access to a good or service, for example, the NHS in the UK. In-kind transfers allocate the benefit provided to specific goods or services, for example, the UK Healthy start scheme provides a targeted group with \u2018vouchers that can only be spent on specific healthy foods\u2019 (Griffith et al., 2018). It was found the impact these vouchers had upon raising utility depended on how highly the consumer values healthy foods. Diagram 1 shows the impact a healthy food voucher has upon infra-marginal consumers.<nl><figure><nl>Infra-marginal consumers already spend more than the vouchers worth on healthy foods as they value these goods highly and therefore a steep indifference curve is used. They are willing to sacrifice a high proportion of other goods to gain a small extra amount of healthy foods. In the diagram, the food voucher is represented by the line A-C. The voucher has caused an increase in utility for the consumer as represented by the rightward shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2. The original point of maximum utility is represented by point X and the new higher maximum utility point is represented by point Y. The provision of food vouchers to infra-marginal consumers has positively impacted utility. Whilst utility has increased, the impact the voucher has had upon these consumers is very \u2018similar to an income-equivalent cash benefit\u2019 (Griffith et al., 2018). This means that providing an unconditional cash transfer to these consumers instead of the vouchers would have a similar effect on utility. They are still likely to spend the additional cash on healthy foods.<nl><nl>On the other hand, distorted consumers do not value healthy foods as highly and therefore the voucher has a different effect upon their utility. Diagram 2 displays the effect of the food voucher upon distorted consumers.<nl><figure><nl>The lower utility received from consuming healthy foods is represented by a flatter indifference curve and this displays the lower marginal rate of substitution. This means that in comparison to diagram 1 the initial maximum utility point X occurs at a much lower quantity of healthy foods. The voucher causes a shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2 and therefore increases the utility from point X to point C. This shows that the vouchers are effective in raising utility for this group of consumers. However, the line C-E represents the cash alternative of the voucher. Here we can see that if these consumers were provided with cash instead of vouchers the higher maximum utility point of Y can be reached. This shows that these consumers are unlikely to purchase healthy foods if provided with a cash alternative to the vouchers. They would instead choose to purchase a variety of other goods and services. For distorted consumers, the food vouchers are less effective in raising utility and the consumers would prefer to receive a cash payment.<nl><nl>Unconditional cash transfer programmes \u2018aim to improve well-being by providing cash to targeted poor households without placing any conditions on the household\u2019s actions\u2019 (Institute for Financial Studies., 2018). Consumers are therefore not restricted on how they spend this money. Providing consumers with additional cash to spend effectively increases their income. The rational choice model assumes that consumers will act rationally and use any additional income to maximise utility. However, behavioural economics challenges this and suggests that the use of labels for these cash payments can influence how the consumer spends this additional money. Behavioural economics \u2018adds elements of psychology to traditional models in an attempt to gain a better understanding of decision making\u2019 (Sloman et al., 2018). For example, the UK Winter Fuel payment is a \u2018cash transfer to older households\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014). \u2018Robust evidence of a behavioural effect of labelling\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014) was found in relation to this unconditional cash transfer. The study found that \u2018on average households spend 47% of the WFP on fuel\u2019 (Beatty et al., 2014). This is in comparison to an expected 3% being spent on fuel if the payment was simply treated as cash. Behavioural economic tools such as nudges can be used to alter how consumers spend their income. This is a clear example of nudge theory and shows that \u2018positive reinforcement\u2019 \u2018can persuade people to make a particular choice\u2019 (Sloman et al., 2018). \u2018When a label is attached to a part of their budget, subjects change consumption according to the label\u2019 (Abler et al., 2017). This evidence shows that consumers are responsive to behavioural economic policies and therefore do not always act like Homo Economicus as suggested by the rational choice model.<nl><nl>Overall, rational choice theory suggests that unconditional cash transfers are more effective at raising consumers\u2019 utility. It allows consumers to purchase the goods and services they decide will maximise their own utility. However, in the long run, depending upon the area of consumption being targeted in-kind transfers may be more beneficial for raising overall welfare. For example, the healthy food vouchers provide families with food of a higher quality and that is more beneficial to their health. If they were instead provided with cash, as the distorted consumer example shows, there is a chance that this money would not be spend on healthy foods and instead it may be used to purchase fast food alternatives. This is then likely to have a long-term impact on health and could contribute to strains on the healthcare system in the future. If unconditional cash transfers are to be used, behavioural economic approaches can be adopted to influence how consumers spend this money to enable the intervention to have the most desired impact.", "positive": "\ufffd<new>Won\u2019t be long x<new>Awake by 8:30 please x<new>Mind furniture collection has arrived!!

{"anchor": "Johns Case:\u2028<nl>John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010).<nl><nl>Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: <nl>John\u2019s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John\u2019s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992).<nl>Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john\u2019s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so.<nl>John\u2019s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017).<nl>As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008),  who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008).<nl><nl>John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John\u2019s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently.\u2028<nl>John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D\u2019Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood.<nl><nl>Coping:<nl>John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not  actually \u2018coping\u2019 as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit  university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance.<nl>In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns\u2019 case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). <nl><nl>Interventions:<nl>The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and  has  little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007).<nl>Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation <nl>The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "positive": "got 1.6k awards\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dthats more than our portfolios combined and doubled in price<new>Mut wake me at 12<new>We got work to do<new>Wake me up if gme is above 400 or below 130<new>^ if its above 250<new>Got 4hr resource booster from login lol<new>Found 8 argons in 5mins\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<new>And got enough plastids to make wukong now<new>Also free rhino skin next month for 8yr anniversary<new>That is weird<new>Inv me<new>And try<new>Lol got resource booster 4 hrs on daily login<new>If ur doing higher volumes its only \u00a31 fee<new>And zero spread<new>Ye thats minor<new>Only whilst market is this rocked", "attacked": "got 1.6k awards\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dthats more than our portfolios combined and doubled in price<novel>Mut wake me at 12<newfangled>We got work to do<new>Wake me up if gme is above 400 or below 130<new>^ if its above 250<new>Got 4hr resourcefulness booster from login lol<new>Found 8 argons in 5mins\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<new>And got enough plastids to make wukong now<new>Also free rhino skin next month for 8yr anniversary<new>That is weird<Modern>Inv me<new>And prove<new>Lol got resource booster 4 hrs on day-after-day login<new>If ur doing high-pitched volumes its only \u00a31 fee<new>And zero spread<new>Ye thats minor<new>Only whilst market is this rocked", "attack_type": "synonym_replacement", "replacement_rate": 0.15, "stats": {"n_original_words": 88, "n_attacked_words": 88, "n_changed": 7, "change_rate": 0.0795}}

{"anchor": "The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport\u2019s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities\u00a0for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA\u2019s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as \u2018dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority\u2019. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the \u2018spirit of sport\u2019 which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong\u2019s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures \u2018clean athletes don\u2019t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments\u2019. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete\u2019s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA\u2019s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete\u2019s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS\u2019 shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was \u2018\u2026 the most detrimental aspect of the Code\u2019.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a \u2018level playing field\u2019<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various\u00a0settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in \u2018sophisticated doping\u2019 in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds\u00a0these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are \u2018unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated\u2019. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated\u00a0doping\u00a0practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised,\u00a0more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya\u2019s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this\u00a0inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should\u00a0be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that \u2018at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach\u2019. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was \u2018a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.\u2019<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies\u2019 ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being \u2018neutral athletes\u2019 provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay\u00a0argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is\u00a0a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for\u00a0children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA\u2019s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", "positive": " they might not have done csuse I've not seen a post about it<new>Can't believe she's pregnant tho<new>Life's moving too fast now<new>i got my <module> mark back and i have once again flopped from getting a first<new>64<new>im flabbergasted all he did was leave comments saying 'good'<new>give me 100 then <pers_FN><new><pers_SN> only just emailed me back<new>mans deadline is today<new>im about to have a look but to be fair ive made so many changes since i submitted that sample that his feedback will probs not be very useful now<new>i stand corrected his feedback was quite decent", "attacked": "they might not have done csuse I've not seen a post about it<new>Can't believe she's pregnant tho<new>Life's actuate too fast now<new>i got my <module> mark back and i have once again flopped from getting a first<new>64<new>im flabbergasted all he did was leave remark saying 'good'<new>give me 100 so <pers_FN><new><pers_SN> only just emailed me back<new>mans deadline is today<new>im about to have a look but to be fair ive give so many changes since i submitted that sampling that his feedback will probs not be very useful now<new>i stand corrected his feedback was quite decent", "attack_type": "synonym_replacement", "replacement_rate": 0.15, "stats": {"n_original_words": 93, "n_attacked_words": 93, "n_changed": 5, "change_rate": 0.0538}}

{"anchor": "Deductive and Inductive reasoning are examples of propositional logic to construct thoughts into a valid argument. Deductive reasoning begins from a general statement that leads to a certain conclusion (Johnson-Laird, 2000; Rips, 1999; Williams, 2000). For example, \u2018all noble gases are stable, helium is a noble gas, so helium is stable.\u2019  Inductive reasoning begins with specific observations which lead to a conclusion that is likely to explain the observation and the conclusion may be used to predict future specific occasions (Johnson-Laird, 2000). An example would be if all children in one day care like Legos, it could be assumed all children like Legos. <nl>A similarity between the reasonings are that they are both used to provide a valid argument and are used often. Another similarity is that both reasonings follow premises in which they base their argument on.<nl>A difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is that deductive reasoning begins with a hypothesis and tests the hypothesis via an observation whilst inductive reasoning begins with observations and then moves towards a theory. This is because deductive inference is based upon theory whilst inductive inference is based on observations. There is also a difference in validity between the reasonings as deductive reasoning is more precise as if all the premises are true then the conclusion is true for example, \u2018if all dolphins are mammals and all mammals have kidneys, all dolphins therefore have kidneys.\u2019 However, even if the premises are true in induction, the conclusion is still not definitely true. For example, \u2018if the first button I get out of a bag is a red button, the third button I obtain from the bag is red, therefore it is inductive logic to conclude all the buttons in a bag are red.\u2019 Therefore, deduction is more accurate and quantitative whilst induction is more general and qualitative. Due to this, induction is used more in everyday life as it is harder to obtain a sequential set of facts that are known to be true in deduction.", "positive": "I was just in the Microsoft teams meeting and I would really like the chance to be able to work in <school> for my placement year.

{"anchor": "An unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for chronic health problems, such as obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that personality traits may make an individual more susceptible to unhealthy eating habits. A personality trait reflects a person\u2019s characteristic pattern of thinking, feeling and behaving (Soto, 2018). According to the Five Factor Model of personality, there are five major trait dimensions: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (OCEAN), also known as the Big Five (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992).<nl>Of the five traits, high neuroticism and low conscientiousness have been consistently associated with unhealthy eating behaviours (UEBs). For instance, highly neurotic individuals tend to consume more sweet, savoury and convenience foods (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015) and higher intakes of sugar and fats (Tiainen, et al., 2013). Individuals low in conscientiousness struggle controlling their impulses to eat unhealthy food over a healthier alternative (Elfhag &amp; Morey, 2008). Low conscientiousness has also been found to predict the consumption of foods indicative of an unhealthy diet (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015).<nl>Based on previous findings, it is hypothesised that there will be a significant positive correlation between neuroticism and UEBs, a significant negative correlation between conscientiousness and UEBs, and no significant relationship between openness to experience, extraversion or agreeableness and UEBs. Simply put, individuals high in neuroticism and low in conscientiousness will demonstrate more unhealthy eating habits.<nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>A sample of 195 participants was recruited using an opportunity sample. Participants included 135 females (69.2%) and 60 males (30.8%) aged between 15 and 73 years (M = 26.6, SD = 13.1).<nl>Design<nl>A correlational design was used. The predictor variables were Big Five personality traits (with five levels: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism). The dependent variable was food frequency questionnaire scores.<nl>Materials<nl>Big Five Inventory (BFI). Personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory (BFI; John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008). The BFI is a 44-item, self-report questionnaire that is divided into subscales for each of the Big Five factors of personality (see Appendix A. The inventory consists of 44 brief statements (e.g. \u2018I see myself as someone who is talkative\u2019) that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u2018strongly disagree\u2019) to 5 (\u2018strongly agree\u2019). A mean score for each subscale was calculated and some of the items were reverse-scored. The BFI presents an average Cronbach\u2019s alpha of .83 and average test-retest reliability of .85 (John &amp; Srivastava, 1999). <nl>Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Food consumption was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ; Hartmann, Siegrist, &amp; van der Horst, 2012). The FFQ is a self adminstered, 182-item questionnaire grouped into four different categories; sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages, meat and convenience foods (see Appendix B). The fruit and vegatable category was excluded, as the present study focused on UEBs. These food groups were chosen because their excessive consumption had been shown to cause serious health problems. Participants were asked to report how often they consumed each item. Items relating to sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages and meat consumption were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (\u2018never\u2019) to 14 (\u2018several times per day\u2019). Items relating to convenience food consumption were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (\u2018never\u2019) to 7 (\u2018daily\u2019). Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.71 for sweets and savouries, 0.69 for sugar-sweetened drinks, 0.69 for meat and 0.71 for convenience foods. Items falling into each food group were summed to reflect consumption frequency of these foods per week.<nl>Procedure<nl>An online questionnaire was created using 44 items from the BFI and 182 items from the FFQ. After providing informed consent, participants were sent an email containing the link to a Google Forms survey. The survey consisted of three separate sections: demographics (gender, age), BFI and FFQ. Upon completion, participants were presented with a debrief page. The raw data set was retrieved from Google Forms as an Excel file. Then, the raw scores were converted into mean scores for the BFI and total scores for the FFQ. For the BFI, negatively keyed items were reverse scored to ensure respondents were providing consistent answers. Items were then coded to the appropriate subscales. A mean score between 1 and 5 was calculated for each BFI trait, by adding up the scores and dividing them by the number of items within that trait. The final data set of demographics, personality traits and eating behaviours was exported to Jamovi (The Jamovi Project, 2021) for analysis. <nl>Statistical analysis<nl>Pearson correlation was used to test the relationship between the Big Five traits and UEBs. Then, a multiple linear regression was performed to explore which personality traits were the best predictors for UEBs. The predictor variables that were hypothesised to be significant predictors were entered into the regression, i.e. conscientiousness and neuroticism.<nl>Results<nl><nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that agreeableness had the highest mean score, while neuroticism had the lowest mean score as well as the highest variation. As the highest possible FFQ score was 182, the mean FFQ score suggests that overall, the sample was health conscious.<nl>Inferential statistics<nl><table><nl>As shown in Table 2, there was a weak negative and statistically significant correlation between conscientiousness and FFQ score. No significant correlation was observed between neuroticism and FFQ score. Low conscientiousness and agreeableness, as well as high neuroticism, were more prominent in younger participants. Higher FFQ scores were also more common in younger participants.<nl><table><nl>A multiple linear regression was performed to test whether conscientiousness and neuroticism signficantly predicted UEBs. The results of the regression indicated that the model explained 2.88% of the variance and that the model was not significant. It was found that conscientiousness was a signifcant predictor of UEBs, while neuroticism was not.<nl>Discussion<nl>The results of the present study support the hypothesis that conscientiousness is a signficiant predictor of UEBs. However, neuroticism is not a significant predictor of UEBs and therefore does not support the hypothesis. The results regarding conscientiousness are consistent with previous research, as they found that low concientiousness predicted the consumption of unhealthy food (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015). <nl>A few limitations could be addressed in future research. Firstly, the present study used self-reported measures of personality traits and eating habits. This presents the possibility of measurement errors and response biases, particularly social desirability. This may also explain why neuroticism was not found to be a significant predictor of UEBs, as the trait is perceived as socially undesirable.<nl>Another limitation is that participants were predominantly female. This creates a gender disparity and may limit the finding\u2019s generalisability to females only. Research has found gender differences in the relationship between personality traits and UEBs. For example, Conner, et al. (2017) found that high neuroticism led to UEBs in males only.<nl>Despite these limitations, understanding the influence of personality traits on eating habits is of paramount importance in developing effective interventions against unhealthy food intake that are tailored to each individual\u2019s characteristic traits.<nl>To conclude, the present study confirms the importance of the conscientiousness trait in eating behaviours. However, further research is required to assess whether health behaviour predictions based on personality are affected by gender and social desirability bias.", "positive": "stem><new>cos it\u2019s taking long to download it<new>oki<new>okay x<new>it\u2019s okay babes don\u2019t worry ab it, i\u2019m home now otherwise i would\u2019ve\ud83d\ude29 xx<new>i\u2019ll see you another time though whenever you\u2019re freee<new>i\u2019ll let you know once i have my schedule for next week cos i\u2019ve got an assignment due this <day> xx<new>yeah omg i was gna ask you just now, leggoooo x<new>lemme see what parks are nice<new>is it called <location>?<new>which ones nicer<new>this one looks good<new>it\u2019s got a biggg lake there i think<new>wait do u wanna get food first<new>shall i meet you in <town>", "attacked": "stem><new>cos it\u2019s taking long to download it<new>oki<new>okay x<unexampled>it\u2019s okay babes don\u2019t worry ab it, i\u2019m home now otherwise i would\u2019ve\ud83d\ude29 xx<new>i\u2019ll see you another time though whenever you\u2019re freee<newfangled>i\u2019ll let you know once i have my schedule for next week cos i\u2019ve got an assignment due this <daytime> xx<new>yeah omg i was gna ask you just now, leggoooo x<new>lemme see what green are nice<new>is it called <location>?<new>which ones nicer<new>this one looks good<new>it\u2019s got a biggg lake there i think<new>wait do u wanna get food first<newfangled>shall i meet you in <town>", "attack_type": "synonym_replacement", "replacement_rate": 0.15, "stats": {"n_original_words": 90, "n_attacked_words": 90, "n_changed": 5, "change_rate": 0.0556}}

{"anchor": "Abstract <nl>59 undergraduate psychology students replicated the Stroop test (Stroop, 1935) by identifying the colour of the font of 60 stimulus words in two conditions: congruent, where the ink colour is consistent with the word itself, and incongruent, where the ink colour is different to the word itself. The results showed that the reaction time for the incongruent condition was longer than the congruent condition. This can be supported by the selective attention theory, which states that it requires more attention to name the ink colours than to read the words (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The future implications of the Stroop test and results of the study involve the ability to identify certain brain regions (MacLeod, 2015). <nl>Introduction<nl>The Stroop Test, introduced by Stroop (1935), is a neuropsychological test which assesses the ability to suppress cognitive interference when the processing of one stimulus slows down the processing of a second stimulus (Scarpina and Tagini, 2017). In Stroop\u2019s first experiment, he used five words and their matching ink colours, and participants were instructed to read each word aloud as fast as possible. In experiment 2, participants had to read the ink colours aloud rather than the word itself. The experimental condition was incongruent as the word was not the same as the colour of the ink. Participants had a longer reaction time when they were instructed to name the ink colour of the incongruent words compared to the congruent words in the control condition (MacLeod, 1991). <nl>This effect can be explained by the selective attention theory, as naming the ink colours required more attention than reading the words, hence these simultaneous stimuli were processed differently (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The interference Stroop effect demonstrated further led to the development of the Stroop Test. Literature suggests that this is a consistent effect, with results of the Stroop test having high reliability (Siegrist, 1995). This gives rise to the hypothesis that the reaction time for the incongruent condition, where the words and font colour are different, will be longer than the congruent condition.<nl>Method<nl>Participants:<nl>59 undergraduate psychology students from their first year at Aston University were recruited for this experiment via opportunity sampling.<nl><nl>Design:<nl>The design was repeated measures and the independent variable was the congruency of the font colour and the meaning of the word itself, with two levels being congruent and incongruent. The dependent variable was the reaction time (in milliseconds) for participants to name the font colour in each condition.<nl><nl>Materials:<nl>PsychoPy was used to implement the design of the experiment and collect reaction time data. The stimulus words for the congruent condition were \u2018red\u2019 in a red font, \u2018green\u2019 in a green font, and \u2018blue\u2019 in a blue font. The stimulus words for the incongruent condition were \u2018red\u2019 in a green font, \u2018green\u2019 in a blue font, and \u2018blue\u2019 in a red font. The response options available were the left arrow for red, the up arrow for green, and the right arrow for blue. <nl><nl>Procedure:<nl>Participants gave informed consent prior to conducting the experiment. They were instructed to identify the colour of the font the word was printed in, by pressing the corresponding responses on the keyboard. The stimuli were presented in a randomised and counterbalanced order. Participants saw the 6 stimulus types 10 times, with 60 trials in total. They then identified the colour of the font of the words by pressing the keyboard as fast as possible, with the keyboard response signalling the next trial. The reaction times for each trial were stored and saved for further analysis.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Table 1.<nl><table><nl><nl>As the hypothesis suggested, the mean for the incongruent condition is higher than the congruent condition (Table 1). The low standard deviations show that results did not vary highly in both conditions, suggesting that results may be consistent within each condition. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in reaction times between incongruent and congruent conditions at a 95% confidence level (Z= -3.638, p= .001). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The research hypothesis was supported as the reaction time for the incongruent condition was significantly longer than that of the congruent condition, which was consistent with previous research by Stroop (1935).<nl>A limitation of the study was the small sample size and type of participants tested, as the results from only 59 undergraduate psychology students fail to produce an accurate representation of the general population. This is shown by Hackshaw (2008), explaining that small sample sizes produce results which overestimate the magnitude of the difference. To improve this, a wider sample size extending outside of the university would be required to assess whether the results are truly reliable. Additionally, the risk of demand characteristics due to the Stroop test being well-known may mean that participants would deliberately take a longer time to identify the colour of the font in the incongruent condition compared to the congruent condition. Research participants are likely to hypothesise an aim of the study when they are aware that they are being observed (Hogg and Cooper, 2007). This could be remedied by introducing a pilot study where participants are asked about their perception of the aim of the study upon completion, allowing for the adaptation of the instructions and presentation of stimuli according to their responses. <nl>Future implications of the Stroop test include its ability in testing the function of associated brain regions (MacLeod, 2015), and the understanding of cognitive interference. This therefore allows for further research on brain regions related to the Stroop test, assisting in treatment and recovery of individuals with brain damage in these areas. Future research testing various groups of people, such as cognitively impaired, could provide useful when investigating which brain regions affect reaction times in the incongruent condition, demonstrating the full extent of the effect of the Stroop test.", "positive": " the link to the survey does not appear to be working.<nl><nl>Thanks<new>Hi,<nl><nl>Yes I managed to submit the report on time.<nl><nl>Thanks,<new>Hi <addr4_FN>,<nl><nl>No worries at all.

{"anchor": "Introduction.  <nl>This strategy paper will focus on combatting the maltreatment of house girls which indicates that gender inequality still exists, thus being perpetuated through the form of violence against women. The strategy will focus on passing laws to criminalise abusers and to formalise the industry by establishing policy surrounding working pay and overall job protection. This paper will begin by outlining background information surrounding the role of house girls and the challenges they face.  <nl>The main body of the paper will then express the previous strategies used, as well as new strategies that can be implemented to alleviate the problem. This will be compared to the context of South African legislation to show their success in emulating such an issue. By including goals, theories and potential allies this paper will provide an effective solution to curve the rate of abuse towards house girls. <nl>Lastly the conclusion will end with summarising all of the findings that seek to combat the issue at hand. <nl><nl>What is a house girl?<nl>According to Oxford dictionary, a house girl is \"defined as a female slave who works in a house (now historical); or any young female domestic servant or employee, especially in some former British dependencies. (Later)\"<nl>For centuries many women and girls have taken on domestic work in the role of domestic house girls as a means for escaping extreme poverty. This industry is normalised in less developed countries especially within Africa. In Nigeria, the most densely populated African country, house girls are particularly popular however due to the lack of workers\u2019 rights, desperation of employees and ineffective laws to protect workers, many girls are prone to maltreatment. This ranges from poor living conditions, sexual abuse and a lack of basic human rights as a whole. <nl><nl>Causes of the problem.<nl>House girls in Nigeria are usually employed by upper- and middle-class families with disposable income to spare and girls as young as 10 start working in such roles. The fundamental reason why this practise is widespread is due to poverty, with \"females from low-income households expected to work, often to contribute to the economic sustenance of the family thus playing the role as the breadwinner\" (Nwaubani 2017). Many people from rural areas travel into main cities such as Lagos in search of better employment opportunities and means of livelihood. <nl> Furthermore, in\u00a0Nigeria, there is a large disparity between the\u00a0education level\u00a0that\u00a0boys and\u00a0girls receive, with many girls failing to have access to adequate\u00a0education\u00a0past a certain age. <nl>This is exemplified through UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2015 where female adult literacy rates (ages 15\u00a0and\u00a0above) in\u00a0Nigeria\u00a0was 59.4% in comparison to the\u00a0male rate of 74.4%. This disparity is a main contributor to why many young women become house girls. Csapo, M (1981) explains how, in particular, in the northern region, Nigerian women are considered secondary citizens therefore education is not so much a priority. Parents, especially that of Muslim heritage are reluctant to send their girls to school due to fear of moral laxity from the westernised teachings.<nl>These customs and beliefs contribute to the disrespect women face whilst at work. The patriarchal society that Nigeria operates on further opens up doors for abuse this is exemplified through feminist theory which view \"oppression of women and patriarchal privilege as a mechanism for violence against women\" (Napikoski 2020). Women who seek to become house girls at whatever educational level should be given the same rights as any other worker. <nl>Furthermore, many house girls lack a job with good working conditions and security due to the lack of labour laws being enforced. This under- the-radar market allows for women to work under exhausting conditions subject to poor pay and long hours and constant insults from their employers. Girls who work for over 8\u00a0hours a day are significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted due to the time spent at work being greater.<nl>Media platforms such as Nollywood also depict house girls as poor, needy and constantly faced with maltreatment. This depiction exemplifies itself in reality.<nl>The maltreatment of house girls is also compounded by the fact that the house girl industry is currently informal. There are no regulations and requirements for any worker thus many women remain at the mercy of their boss, simply leaving women vulnerable to crime and exploitative employment.<nl>Children who are a part of this informal sector are especially at risk of sexual exploitation creating long term problems such as unwanted pregnancies and psychosocial trauma. (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 2019)<nl>Domestic slavery makes $18 billion alone in Africa and entry into this informal economy has significantly increased in recent times, the house girl economy thrives because of ready availability of services for the market. This in turn cuts through all necessary checks and procedures which protect female workers. Employers further defend themselves by saying these girls are better off working in homes, rather than on the street.<nl>Due to this industry occurring in people\u2019s private household, boundaries between the public and private sphere and the states involvement becomes hard to cross, nevertheless, this is an issue that must be addressed as it is an infringement on human rights and these unfortunate experiences truly manifest themselves in the everyday life of women. <nl><nl>Previous strategies.<nl>Pressure from outsider groups have called for the police and government to protect female workers including house girls due to the trafficking they are prone to. <nl>In 2004, the Nigerian government created the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), an anti-trafficking agency, designed to tackling trafficking. Between 2003-2017, they were successful in recovering over 3000 victims. Furthermore in 2015 Nigeria altered their trafficking laws to elevate penalties for offenders and criminalise those who employed children under 12 in domestic labour. Whilst human rights activists such as The National Human Rights Commission, work with the police and NAPTIP to secure prosecutions and provide shelter and aid for victims, the issue still persists. <nl>At present there are national legislative inconsistencies towards the minimum age to work (2015 US Labour Department report). The Child Rights Act prohibits those under 18 from working yet the Labour Act sets the minimum age of employment at 12. This elucidates the inconsistency of the legislative system in protecting female workers.<nl>Ultimately this ambiguousness needs to be removed or amended in order to tackle violence against house girls.<nl><nl>Proposed strategies<nl>1. Registration of employees.<nl>Providing domestic help is not the main cause of abuse as across countries, where there is less domestic abuse, this is seen with the likes of au-pairs, nannies, maids etc. such as in the UK.<nl>Chinelo Ezenwaadding, a female rights activist, claims \"the house help industry can be a positive thing because you get to help others, but it should be regulated and there should be laws governing the treatment of maids.\" Therefore, by establishing employment policy standards we can reach a greater environment for workers and tackle violence cases. I believe this is the most utilitarian approach.<nl>In Nigeria, there is a high number of house girls that have not been recognised as official workers, thus feed into the informal economy.  This presents several problems and avoidable situations such as limited accessibility to any legal rights if needed. <nl>\"The informal economy represents a multi\u2010facetted and spatially diverse phenomenon\" (Fajana 2008). However, through regulation of this informal work, advantages will arise such as industrial peace and order. Therefore, every female of the legal working age needs to be put on a governmental system acknowledging house girls as established employees. Workers must be registered in order to start working providing this switch from an informal to formal sector will reduce the chances of maltreatment through ending under aged workers and exploitation towards females. <nl>Accountability for any unethical matters can be upheld and under-the-radar crimes which were once hard to record can now be accounted for. By implementing this policy the economy will be regulated and VAW reduced.<nl><nl>2. Establishing a living minimum wage.<nl>The Capitalist Entrepreneurial Theory (Schumpeter 1942) aims to give an explanation behind inequality and poverty claiming \"the payment of meagre wage rates, as well as unfair, poor and irritating  working  conditions, are  means  of exploiting  the masses of  workers  and excessive, illustrating the constant cycle of poverty for these working women\". <nl>However this needs to be dismantled through giving a basic living salary that workers can survive on and is fairly reflected through the work they do. According to Naira Land Forum, \"house girls are paid from as little as 15,000 to 30,000 naira equating to \u00a329.64-59.27 a month\".<nl>This contradicts with the monthly cost of living, which according to Statisais, is 43,000 naira thus illustrating how female workers are prone to no personal growth opportunities. Many of these women have economic responsibilities leaving them no choice but to work even for a minimum wage. Poverty is a primary risk factor that renders women and girls vulnerable to sex trafficking\" (PJI 2018)<nl>\"The growing labour force of this informal sector means that informal economy workers accept wages below the legal minimum levels\" (Anyanwu, 1994) this effects house girls, which in essence means that employment contacts between both employee and employer must be established, setting out hours of work and legal workers\u2019 pay . This will reduce any form of financial abuse and studies imply that the best approach to lessen violence against women is to combine economic empowerment and gender equity efforts.<nl>This must be made universal for all working women and government must intervene to enabling this is established.<nl>England has successfully demonstrated this with implementing contracts for au- pairs which state clear agreements on provisions regarding regulated working hours and pay. Nigeria must adapt this same approach to allow for female emancipation.<nl><nl>3. Establishing a skills workshop.<nl>A weak to non-existent system for protecting children from abuse is prevalent across Nigeria (Santos Pais 2014)<nl>A community based approach, which doesn\u2019t allow the lack of education to be a hindrance to one\u2019s progression, is an essential tool towards female independence. Through providing government funded, free access to vocational skills for house girl who have been abused, this safe space will equip females with a broad set of skills to prepare them for another job sector. This differs from conventional shelters in that it re-trains females -emphasising the importance of rehabilitation to go back into the world of work thus enabling them to generate income to sustain themselves and their families.<nl>This approach can be further recognised through government coalition -working with local churches and charities to bring awareness to this cause.  <nl><nl>4. Legal reform.<nl>South African legislators have showed commitment to addressing violence against women through passing the Domestic Violence Act in 1998 which introduced minimum sentences for rape and tightened bail requirements for those accused of rape. Through establishing a new Ministry for Women, Children and Persons with Disability this further denotes commitment to combatting violence against women and seeked to go against the cultural norms towards violence against women especially within private households were proof of abuse was often difficult obtain. As a result, significant contributions consisted of an increased conviction rate and a decrease in rape cases.<nl>\"In Nigeria among women aged 15\u201349 who have survived physical or sexual violence, 45% never got help or told anyone about the experience\" (NPC and ICF International 2014).Therefore the same legal and effective approaches must be taken by Nigerian policy makers to protect the rights of female house girls with potential threats that they could be faced with. A safe haven must be created for house girls who have been victimised thus providing severe consequences for criminals who perform and assist in abusing house girls. This unequivocally will drive down the cases of abuse. <nl>Structurally, a national framework protecting house girls from abuse should be established across Nigeria. Law enforcement officers are fundamentally necessary at the frontline of the criminal justice system. Their attitude and response towards violence against house girls can have a dramatic impact on ensuring the prevention of future violent acts and that the protection of victims are upheld. Violence against women and girls cannot be fought by women alone. Thus, law enforcement officers must be adequately trained and compensated so that they willing to do their jobs diligently.<nl>A South African project in 2000 successfully provided resources for facilitators to train prosecutors working in the area of VAW. This highlights that through time, investment and attitudinal changes Government efforts can be effective.<nl><nl>Conclusion.<nl>To conclude a strategy which focuses on legislative and humanitarian goals is crucial in reducing the rates of abuse. <nl>In co-operation with the Nigerian government the strategies presented in this paper will improve the standard of living for house girls and provide a modernised criminal justice system in which justice can be ratified if any women has been treated unfairly.<nl>It will also push house girls out of poverty alleviation and give women the tools to gain workers freedom, a concept that should be universal for all house girls across the globe. <nl>Ultimately the maltreatment of house girls in Nigeria is challenging to dismantle but efficient implementations of these proposed tactics will combat the maltreatment of house girls in Nigeria.", "positive": "lo sir, I am in your seminar class for <module> and I am just wondering if you could please read part of my essay for the assignment which is due.

{"anchor": "\"The mercantile law\u2026 is the same all over the world. For\u2026 the same premises, the sound conclusions of reason and justice must universally be the same\". This opinion led to the signing of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) in 1980, coming into force on 1st January 1988. Operating on \"contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places of business are in different States\", and aiming to provide a set of default, harmonised rules to be applied in the absence of specified terms, the CISG has been adopted in ninety-four states as of September 2020.<nl>However, the UK is not a signatory; instead, English sale of goods law is governed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979. The dominance of English law in this field, demonstrated by the mirroring of it within the Hong Kong Sale of Goods Ordinance, means that if the UK ratified the Convention, it would undermine the position of its domestic law, potentially causing the loss of its international status. This alongside the CISG\u2019s civil law influences, resulting in \"rules foreign to\u2026 the common law\u2019 of the UK, and the lack of comprehensive cover offered by the Convention, with no mention of areas including the passing of property, makes it \u2018less suitable to commodity sales than the English Sale of Goods Act\u2019. As such, the UK government has historically seen no demand for ratification of the CISG. <nl>The commercial law on international sale of goods \"aims at establishing certainty and trust and the reduction of transaction costs\". In exploring and comparing the remedies available under both the CISG and SGA, this essay will examine the extent to which English domestic law remains capable of this; or whether the Convention \"would be a useful addition to (or in certain circumstances, replacement of) English sale of goods law as it currently exists\".<nl>Overall, I will argue that English common law promotes the most commercial certainty, and therefore ratification of the CISG is not required as an addition or replacement of the Sale of Goods Act 1979.<nl><nl>Remedies<nl>Typical of a common law jurisdiction, English law adopts a restrictive approach to remedies. Under which, the measurement used for determining remedies available is the importance to the parties of the contractual obligation being breached \u2013 differentiating between breach of a major term (\"condition\") and a lesser term (\"warranty\"). However, the classification of each term remains a matter for judicial interpretation based on the construction of the contract; this dual system being criticised as overly simplistic. The trivialisation was demonstrated when the Court of Appeal first made reference to a third classification \u2013 \u2018innominate\u2019 terms \u2013 whereby a breach may or may not lead to the right of repudiation, depending on the severity of the breach. <nl>Meanwhile, the CISG was designed considering the special characteristics of the international sale of goods, including the long distances involved, costs of transportation and length of the term of the contracts. To accommodate such factors, the Convention adopts a more permissive remedial approach, as common for a civil law jurisdiction. Set out in Article 45(1) and 61(1), remedies available depend on the breach severity, measured in relation to a \u2018fundamental breach\u2019, as defined to be an act that \"results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract\" . However, the Article \"does not provide clear guidelines for distinguishing fundamental breach from non-fundamental ones\" and case law, such as Doolim Corp v R Doll and Bundesgericht, does not clarify the differentiation either. <nl>As such, both the CISG and English law provide similar provisions for determining remedies available, each resulting in uncertainty. Initially, the warranty and conditions system under the SGA appears to promote certainty considering s12-15 SGA establish items designated to be conditions and warranties. However, the mention of \"innominate terms\u2026 'fatally' remove[s this] element of certainty which is an essential provision in contracts and gives rise to an increasing number of arbitrations\". Similarly, Grebler details the uncertainty associated with defining \u2018fundamental breach\u2019 under the CISG in terms of the phasing of Article 25; explaining how the conditions, exceptions and affirmative statements within the same sentence antagonise its accurate interpretation. Hence demonstrating that both systems harbour their own uncertainty; failing to imply one is any more favourable than the other.<nl><nl>Damages<nl>Under the SGA 1979, damages serve as the primary remedy \u2013 drawing \"a distinction between a provision for a \"penalty\", which is not valid, and a provision for \"liquidated damages,\" which is valid\". Whilst other remedies exist under domestic law, and \"parties are generally free to choose their own remedies, English law will not enforce all the remedies, at least not to the same degree\". <nl>Alternatively, damages are also available under Article 74 of the CISG, which places no limit on the amount of compensation that parties can agree to pay upon breach of contract. To the same effect, damages under the CISG can also be claimed in conjunction with other remedies provided overcompensation does not occur. This flexible approach can also be seen in the principle of freedom of contract in Article 6, whereby parties can derogate from the Convention, including Article 74, in order to replace them with bespoke clauses, such as one on remedy and damages available. National law would then govern the validity of such clauses, which will be upheld in place of their CISG alternative, as seen in ICC International Court of Arbitration Award No 99781999. This being said, whilst this gives parties the freedom to establish their own remedies, they will not necessarily be enforced uniformly between countries as elements such as penal clauses are a matter of public policy, to be dictated by the jurisdiction in which the contract operates.<nl>This demonstrates that whilst \"[the] CISG approach has the merit of being more transparent and truer to the commercial purpose of very many contracts\u2026 the Sale of Goods Act approach\u2026 may be the easier to apply\". The Convention undeniably allows for a more flexible approach to damages, compared to the more limited scope of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. However, if this flexible approach, caveated by domestic law, cannot be applied and interpreted uniformly, it fails to provide the harmonisation of law that it aims to achieve; instead generating uncertainty that would be detrimental, and not a useful addition, to English law if incorporated.<nl><nl>Specific performance<nl>The doctrine of specific performance \"reflect[s] the principle\u2026 that the law should compel parties specifically to perform their contractual obligations\". Under English law, a remedy of specific performance is available under s52 SGA 1979 but is only available to the buyer, and is only granted in exceptionally rare circumstances where the \"courts of equity were without jurisdiction unless the remedy at law was inadequate\", as demonstrated by Lord Hoffman in Co-Operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores. Whilst the doctrine in theory \"applies to all cases where the goods are specific or ascertained, whether the property has passed to the buyer or not\", there is no guarantee that the court will always exercise its discretion and enforce specific performance, even in instances where the buyer has struggled to obtain replacement goods such as custom machinery or a ship. As such, this discretionary approach under English law demonstrates a lack of uniformity in application that has been criticised for being detrimental to commercial certainty.<nl>Concurrently, under Articles 46 of the CISG, a \"buyer may require performance of the seller of his obligations unless the buyer has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement\", with a mirrored provision for the seller under Article 62. The lack of a requirement for the goods to be specific and identified under the contract, allows these articles to avoid \"some of the uncertainty associated with the scope of specific performance under the SGA\". However, \"due to the divergent common-law and civil-law perceptions\u2026, the\u2026 CISG included article 28 as a compromise\", which \"seeks to preserve domestic law regarding the availability of specific performance\". As such, \"a court is not bound to enter a judgment for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law\", as demonstrated in Magellan International Corporation v Salzgitter Hanbdel GmbH. This article therefore makes the remedy of specific performance discretionary rather than mandatory, and creates its own uncertainty as this caveat is \"disruptive [of] the Conventions underlying goal of uniformity\".<nl>Overall, the approach of English law means that the \"precise scope of when a court might have the power or discretion to grant specific performance is\u2026 unclear\". The adoption of the CISG \"will have the opportunity to clarify English law on this point\", and may allow for the widening of the scope of application based on its less restrictive definition. However, the inclusion of Article 28 means that the CISG cannot replace domestic law on this matter, and given the reluctance of the English courts to enforce s52(1) SGA, it is unlikely that the addition of the CISG to English law would result in any expansion of the doctrine, or additional commercial certainty. Instead, it is likely to cause further confusion due to the lack of uniformity in its own application, thus resulting in further costs when settling the inevitable increase in related disputes.<nl><nl>Granting of additional time (\u2018Nachfrist\u2019)<nl>The Sale of Goods Act 1979 contains no express remedy for the granting of additional time in order to perform contractual obligations. S10 of the Act contains stipulations regarding timing of contracts, deeming remedy only to be available on these grounds if timing is of the \u2018essence\u2019.  Whilst the House of Lords confirmed that time stipulations in mercantile contracts will typically be considered to be of the essence, the shift away from considering breaches in terms of \u2018conditions\u2019 and \u2018warranties\u2019 results in further uncertainty. This being said, under English law the non-breaching party can grant additional time, as per s11(2) SGA, by waiving the original contractual term and establishing a new notice making the new time frame to be of the essence, as in Stickney v Keeble. <nl>Similarly, under the CISG, Articles 47 and 63 provide for the allowance of additional time as seen in civil jurisdictions, and referred to as Nachfrist after the similar German law remedy. Rooted in the CISG\u2019s aims of maintaining viability of contract, rather than avoiding them, Nachfrist allows for \u2018reasonable\u2019 periods of delay in performance of contracts. However, as with English law\u2019s approach, uncertainty stems from the \u2018reasonability\u2019 element of this requirement. Such uncertainty, leading to increasing disputes and ultimately higher costs of transaction, as in Germany Oberlandesgericht where whilst the original fixed period of two weeks agreed was deemed an \u2018unreasonable\u2019 addition, the seven weeks that followed were held to be \u2018reasonable\u2019 based on the facts.<nl>In both systems, whilst the approach differs, the granting of the additional period in both is seen to be a \"kind of estoppel\" preventing the non-defaulting party from seeking other remedies during this period, but for the avoidance of the contract if the additional period is not met. Equally, both systems \"give the defaulting party the protection of a reasonable time, at the expense of the innocent party's certainty of when a time period would be considered reasonable\". As such, there would unlikely be any benefit to incorporating the CISG into English law in this respect in terms of commercial certainty gained or expansion of the doctrine.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>\"In Commercial Law, the parties plan and negotiate their transactions based on their understanding of the legal rules that govern their transactions, and in the expectation that these rules will remain\u2026 stable in the future.\" As such, to consider incorporating the CISG into English domestic law, there would have to be notable benefits associated to outbalance the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of the new rules.<nl>Having first come into effect in 1983, and not having been updated more recently than 1979, the Sale of Goods Act would benefit from expansion and modernisation. Comparatively to the CISG, the remedies available are far more restrictive, as demonstrated by the more restricted scope for damages and limited willingness to apply principles including specific performance and the granting of additional time. Whilst all such remedies are accounted for under both the SGA and the CISG, the SGA\u2019s approach has been criticised for giving insufficient gravitas to the complex and logistical nature of the international sale of goods. Comparatively, as the Convention borrows from a range of both common and civil law jurisdictions, it is considered to be more up to date with modern requirements of international trade, and representing of global best practices, for example catering for the \u2018reasonable\u2019 delays resulting from many transactions easily under Nachfrist rather than requiring the explicit waiving and recreation of terms.<nl>This being said, \"[an] extremely important goal for the CISG is to achieve\u2026 uniformity and certainty with regard to remedies available\", yet \"[no] international commercial legal regime can expect to be perfect, especially when it is developed on the basis of compromise between legal systems\". The required compromise is particularly evident in Article 28 of the CISG, explicitly giving domestic law superiority over the Convention in terms of specific performance. It is this compromise between common and civil jurisdictions that means that the CISG \u2018contains hidden complexities which can easily lead\u00a0to errors\u2019, as in FilantoS.p.A. v Chilewich International Corp, that would likely result in an increased number of disputes if incorporated into English law.<nl>As such, I believe the outcome from the previous two consultations carried out by the UK Department of Trade and Industry on the possible incorporation of the CISG in 1989 and 1997  stands \u2013 ratification is not a priority. Whilst it would bring the UK in line with many of its global trading partners, \u2018in all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty\u2026 because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon\",  and \"[no] matter what the merits or drawbacks of the CISG, it cannot instantly create the same measure of legal certainty and is therefore condemned to exclusion so long as English law, or rather courts and arbitrators applying English law, do their job well\". In kind, following PST Energy 7 Shipping v OW Bunker Malta (The \u2018Res Cogitans\u2019), \u2018many similar cases worldwide await[ed the] decision with interest\u2019, showing the global dominance of English law on the sale of goods remains intact. Thus, as it currently stands, the CISG remains an unnecessary addition to, or replacement for the law; instead, it should remain a guideline of global standards of best practice to which the UK can compare its own domestic law.", "positive": "<addr1_FN>,<nl><nl>Perfect, thank you.<nl><nl>I look forward to speaking with you later in the week.<nl><nl>Best wishes,<nl><part_FN><new>Good morning <addr1_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I hope you are well.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you for my grade.

{"anchor": "Results<nl>Data treatment<nl>After the data was recorded, the alpha channel was duplicated which made it easier to keep track of the transformations made to the signal (\"EEG Analysis with AcqKnowledge\", 2006). The data was rectified in order to turn the negative values into positive so that the average signal strength (\u00b5V) was shown rather than the range. The data was averaged over 50 samples using Biopac\u2019s \u2018Integrate\u2019 feature which allowed for the graph curves to be smoother and clearer. The rectification and integration of the data was necessary so that an accurate mean could be taken for each condition. These new rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for the rest of the data analysis. <nl><nl>Descriptive &amp; inferential statistics<nl>Table 1.<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that the mean of the eyes open condition was lower than the eyes closed condition. There was not a large amount of variance of data across the means (see Table 1). The eyes open condition had a smaller variance than the eyes closed, as the standard deviation was closer to the mean in this condition. The Chi\u00b2 test suggests that the frequencies of the RAAA are significantly different in the eyes open and closed conditions (Chi\u00b2 = 12.500, df = 1, p &lt; .01). The RAAA frequency was 26 in the eyes closed condition and 6 in the eyes open condition, so the means are consistent with the RAAA frequencies. <nl><nl>To summarise, the results show that there is a difference between the RAAA frequencies of the eyes open and eyes closed conditions. These results were expected as brain rhythms differ when eyes are open or closed (Barry et al., 2007).<nl><nl>Reflection<nl>I have achieved a general understanding of physiological measurement using Biopac from conducting this study, as I have learnt how to use the system to rectify and integrate data in order for it to be more understandable to analyse. As a group, we found the placement of the electrodes using the international 1020 positioning system fairly difficult, as it wasn\u2019t particularly clear where exactly to place them on the scalp. We had to change the positioning of the electrodes and remove the dead skin from the scalp a few times until the impedance was low enough to continue the rest of the experiment. I didn\u2019t enjoy placing the electrodes on the participant\u2019s scalp and measuring the distance between the nasion and the inion because both tasks were meticulous and required a lot of patience. However, I did enjoy using Biopac to rectify the data in order to see clearly the brainwaves of the participant and how it correlated with whether their eyes were open or closed. In order to improve the experiment, I would reduce the number of confounding variables by ensuring the participant wasn\u2019t blinking, talking or chewing during the experiment, as these artifacts may have had an impact on the data used for analysis. Additionally, I would have ensured the experiment took part in a quiet room away from other people as it is more likely for the brainwave activity to be due to whether the participant\u2019s eyes were open or closed rather than distractions.<nl>", "positive": "y better than they was earlier<new>Yeye maybe<new>But I think they ok<new>Booking train tix to arrive on <DDth> <month_abbr> at 2pm and arrive back to <city> by 5:15 on <day><new>Ok, do u mean go to <city> on <DD><DDth> ?<new>Or u go to <city><new>Ohhhh okay makes sense<new>Ye sounds bless<new>Awh he loves my wardrobe<new>Is he back yet?<new>Dw he'll be fine<new>\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a<new>Soz was showering<new>Ooooohhh awh<new>Arrives at <station> at 1:41pm<new>Yeye dw<new>Meet at <station> and wander around!<new>Um ok<new>Okr<new>Meet at <station><new>And I don't mind going anywhere<new>Pls dony\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d<new>Leave at 820", "attacked": "y better than they was earlier<new>Yeye maybe<new>But I think they ok<new>Booking train tix to arrive on <DDth> <month_abbr> at 2pm and arrive back to <metropolis> by 5:15 on <day><new>Ok, do u mean go to <city> on <DD><DDth> ?<new>Or u go to <city><new>Ohhhh okay makes gumption<new>Ye fathom bless<new>Awh he loves my closet<new>Is he back yet?<new>Dw he'll be fine<new>\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a<new>Soz was showering<new>Ooooohhh awh<new>Arrives at <station> at 1:41pm<new>Yeye dw<new>Meet at <station> and wander around!<new>Um ok<new>Okr<new>Meet at <station><new>And I don't listen going anywhere<new>Pls dony\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d<new>Leave at 820", "attack_type": "synonym_replacement", "replacement_rate": 0.15, "stats": {"n_original_words": 81, "n_attacked_words": 81, "n_changed": 5, "change_rate": 0.0617}}

I would like to just say that I do not question <pers_FN> ability to mark well- he was a great lecturer this term and I thoroughly enjoyed this module, which is why I was saddened by my mark as I engaged heavily in extra reading out of interest.<nl><nl>My appeal wasn\u2019t on the grounds of academic judgement, my problem with my mark was primarily due to being marked down for things that aren\u2019t specified in the assessment brief or mark scheme. For example, it was noted that in order to do well, my essay must show that I have engaged with content and extra reading, which even my feedback states I have achieved.<nl><nl>Additionally, the brief stating \"Feel free to introduce your own personal reflections where you feel they are relevant, but keep these reflections concise and do not let them distract from the overall task\" In my instance, I decided to reflect rarely as I did not believe this was compulsory by the use of \"feel free\" and instead wished to avoid risking distraction. However, this was something I was marked down for.<nl><nl>However, regarding the actual assignment, I compared my interviewee\u2019s culture to my own by referencing the different cultural dimensions between the UK and <country>, and applied this to the work place issues as asked of me in the brief.<nl><nl>Basically, I completely trust <pers_FN> judgement, my concern is just that I achieved exactly what the brief asks of me, and in relation to the marking criteria where the 2:2 boundary states:<nl><nl>\"<copied_text>\"- The feedback states that if anything I was heavy on research<nl><nl>\"<copied_text>\"- I included an extra section from what was included in the brief so arguably more than some effort was made<nl><nl>\"<copied_text>\".- On top of the interview I included a survey I also completed with the interviewee to further understand her culture in relation to the <topic>, showing extensive efforts.<nl><nl><nl>Therefore for these reasons, I genuinely believe that 50% was incredibly low if the marking criteria was considered. I take pride in the fact i\u2019ve not ever achieved below a first for written coursework assignments, so I hope that you can understand this came as a little shock to me. For future students, please ensure that if something is compulsory, it is stated on the assignment brief so that it isn\u2019t missed somehow like I did.<nl><nl>Regarding the mark from the external examiner, will they be aware of the mark before marking my work?

{"anchor": "Abstract<nl>Previous research has suggested that incongruent stimuli delays reaction times than congruent stimuli. In this study, participants were presented with words of colours and were asked to respond to the font colour. The words either matched their font colour (congruent) or were dissimilar to their font colour (incongruent). Their reaction time was measured in milliseconds (ms) across 60 trials and comparisons were drawn between the two conditions. The mean reaction time was 878.8ms for the congruent condition and 966.8ms for incongruent. This difference is significant.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>When performing the classic Stroop task, participants were asked to identify the colour of a printed word and ignore its meaning (Entel &amp; Tzelgov, 2018). The Stroop effect occurs when the written word (\"blue\") is printed in a non-matching font colour (red) which delays reaction time. The stimuli (words) are incongruent and reaction time is affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words. (Stroop, 1935; Braisby &amp; Gellatly, 2012; Grondin, 2016). <nl>Previous research has suggested that incongruent stimuli delays reaction times than congruent stimuli. There is literature that suggests that this is a consistent effect. <nl>Stroop (1935) compared the difference in time for reading words printed in black and coloured ink (2.3 seconds) then the difference in naming colours of the squares and font colour (47.0 seconds). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Results from Stroop (1935) showed that reaction times slowed, by an average 110.3 seconds (Goodwin, 2010), when the font colour was different from the meaning of the word (for example, when \u2018red\u2019 was written in yellow ink) in comparison to naming the word in colour (43.3 seconds) - 67 seconds difference.<nl><figure><nl>Other studies have also shown this effect such as Datta, Nebhinani &amp; Dixit (2019). Datta et al. (2019) compared the difference in reaction times in three conditions (neutral, congruent and incongruent). The incongruent condition (condition 3), had participants reacting to both Hindi and English versions of the Stroop task where the words were written in both English and Hindi. The incongruent condition meant the name of the colour-word did not match with the font colour (Datta et al., 2019). The study had 42 participants and each condition of each language had 48 trials.<nl>Results from Datta et al. (2019) showed a mean of 1051.93 milliseconds (ms) in the English version incongruent condition which was 54.8 ms slower than the Hindi version in condition 3 (997.13 ms) and 151.63 ms slower when comparing to the English version in Condition 2 (900.30 ms).<nl>These researchers found that incongruent trials took longer to respond to than congruent trials, therefore the prediction for this study was that students would take longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than reacting to stimuli in the congruent condition.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Design<nl>The experiment used a repeated measures design. The independent variable was congruency with two levels - incongruent and congruent. The dependent variable was reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl><nl>Participants<nl>Overall, there were 59 participants. All were Psychology Undergraduate students from Aston University and a volunteer sample, recruited through University comms.<nl><nl>Apparatus and Materials<nl>Participants used personal computers to complete the experiment. This study used PsychoPy to collect data \u2013 an experimental software which recorded participants reaction time. <nl>The words used were \u2018Red\u2019, \u2018Green\u2019, and \u2018Blue\u2019 (See Figure. 3, Figure. 4 and Figure. 5). The font used was Arial, with the stimuli positioned in the centre of the screen at (0,0). The response options were keyboard arrow keys, left for \u2018red\u2019 ink, up for \u2018green\u2019 and right for \u2018blue\u2019. There were 10 reps to each 6 stimulus types, totalling 60 trials in blocks of 10.<nl><figure><nl>Procedure<nl>Participants gave consent to participate in the study and took part in the experiment individually.<nl>At the beginning of the experiment, participants received written instructions on their monitor. Participants read the instructions in their own time before pressing an arrow on the keyboard to begin the experiment. The instructions described what the participants were to do and which keys they would need to use to respond to the stimuli. (See Appendix 1 for full instructions.).<nl>The stimuli were presented on the computer in a random sequence, the words appearing singularly, on the monitor, centre-screen, and only disappearing when participants pressed an accepted key. The experiment ended when all 60 trials were completed.<nl><nl>Results <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent than colour congruent condition. Both SDs are high relative to the mean, this suggests the data may not be reliable as there are large within condition differences. However, a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant (T = 403.0 , N = 59, p&lt;.001).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>Conclusion<nl>The results are consistent with the hypothesis of this study and previous research, as participants took longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition \u2013 statistically significant. This suggests that reaction time was affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words when attempting to react to the colour (Stroop, 1935; Braisby et al. 2012; Grondin, 2016; MacLeod, 1991). Cohen, Dunbar &amp; McClelland (1990) would suggest that this also illustrates the way people process information and people\u2019s capacity for selective attention.<nl><nl>Methodological Issues<nl>Due to the way the experiment was ran, participants completed the study not in a standardised environment, completing the study on the different computers or PCs in dissimilar environments. If this study were repeated, participants would use a standard University computer. Also, to verify the demographics of the participants to confirm the ratio of gender and age, as studies has found gender and age differences to response with the Stroop task.  (\"What the Stroop Effect Reveals About Our Minds | Lesley University\", 2020).<nl><nl>Further Research<nl>Further research could include changing the stimulus to test its effects on reaction time. For example, changing the word to be a synonym of the colour (changing red to crimson) or becoming an anagram (red to rde) - like Hintzman et al. (1972); Regan (1978).<nl>Alternatively, changing the colour to a random word (red to \u2018ask\u2019, \u2018monkey\u2019, \u2018heart\u2019, \u2018blood\u2019.)

{"anchor": "Hi Ms (name), After reviewing the local area in Helsinki, I have planned an itinerary for you to view. Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging \u00c2\u00a3163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros. I hope this all sounds appealing to you.

{"anchor": "<question1><nl><nl>ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition, characterised by the co-occurrence of impairments in social interaction, communication development and restrictedrepetitive behaviours (RRBs) (Bakhtiari et al (2012). Advances in brain scanning techniques seen in the past two decades (such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), has provided a unique opportunity to assess brain connectivity and how differences relative to the neurotypical brain, may contribute to the profile of behaviours seen in ASD.<nl><nl>Underconnectivity theory hypothesises that ASD and its characteristic deficits is caused as a direct result of under functioning in integrative circuitry, that results in an impairment of information integration at neuralcognitive levels (Just et al., 2004).  Just et al (2004) tested this hypothesis, using 17 high functioning ASD individuals compared with typically developing (TD) matched controls, paired on the basis of verbal IQ. All participants completed a sentence comprehension task whilst in an fMRI scanner, assessing functional connectivity between the language areas of the brain. It was found that ASD individuals showed a large systematic difference in distribution of brain activity relative to TD controls, with posterior left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke\u2019s area) activation being greater in ASD and left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca\u2019s area) activation greater in control participants. Furthermore, it was seen that functional connectivity between the language areas in ASD was lower throughout the cortical language systems in comparison to controls. Just et al (2004) suggests these findings have implications for the behaviours seen in ASD, namely atypical strengths in processing single words but deficits in interpreting complex sentences and stories. This may in turn account for the difficulties seen in ASD when interpreting homographs (Happ\u00e9, 2011). It is speculated that this underconnectivity between cortical regions applies to other higher-level functions. Research assessing theory of mind (ToM), specifically mentalising, in ASD individuals supports this (Castelli et al., 2002). Castelli et al (2002) found that individuals with ASD were less accurate and offered less interpretations during a mental state attribution task relative to controls and that this correlated with reduced activation in the brain\u2019s mentalising network. Despite support from other literature, caution should be taken when interpreting Just et al\u2019s (2004) findings because of its low external validity. Only a small sample size was used, including only high functioning Caucasian individuals, meaning it cannot capture and account for the broad spectrum of ASD and the wider population. <nl>White matter (WM) is key for efficient and synchronised communication between brain regions, underpinning the foundation of brain connectivity (Dean et al., 2016). Research suggests atypical WM microstructure may account for the deficits seen in ASD. Bakhtiari et al (2012) assessed this in ASD participants compared to neurotypical (NT) individuals using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). It was found that ASD participants showed decreased fractional anisotropy values (FA), bilaterally spanning over a large brain region relative to controls, telling of maldevelopment in WM. These decreased FA values in ASD individuals correlated with social and communication difficulties, assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Regions displaying decreased FA in WM tracts included those implicated in emotional face processing (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus), language (inferior longitudinal fasciculus) and executive function (inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, which is linked to attention). A limitation of Bakhtiari et al\u2019s (2012) study is that participants were not screened for other neurological conditions i.e. schizophrenia and ADHD which have also been identified as showing abnormalities in WM, namely low FA relative to controls (Davenport et al., 2010). Furthermore, Bakhtiari et al\u2019s findings do not account for RRBs seen in ASD, with research suggesting an association between high FA values and RRBs (Cheung et al., 2009). This shows that the picture surrounding WM and the ASD behaviours is not completely clear yet and future research should seek to address this.<nl>To conclude abnormal brain connectivity appears to play an integral role in the profile of behaviours and differences in cognitive function seen in those with ASD. Underconnectivity theory arguably provides a robust account of language as well as ToM deficits seen in ASD (Just et al., 2004; Castelli et al., 2002). Meanwhile low FA values, indicative of WM disruption in ASD, can account for impairments in social and communication domains (Just et al., 2004). As mentioned above, DTI literature has also shown increased FA values corelating with RRBs seen in ASD (Cheung et al.,2009).  Some researchers suggest atypical brain connectivity underpins the differences seen in ASD, going as far as to suggest it is the first firm finding in ASD research (see Hughes, 2007).<nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogenous neurological disorder, defined and diagnosed by the co-occurrence of impairments in communication, social interaction and the existence of restrictedrepetitive behaviours and interests in an individual (Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015). Some researchers suggest that ASD is a fractionable disorder (Happ\u00e9 et al., 2006). Those in support of fractionation argue that there is no single cause for the symptomology seen in ASD and it may be speculated that this is contributing to the \u2018lost generation\u2019 of ASD individuals (see Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015) whose needs may not be being met (Happ\u00e9, 2006). Evidence in support of fractionation theory, largely comes from research into the broader autism phenotype (BAP), defined as subclinical level of ASD symptoms within the general population, that exist outside of the threshold for an ASD diagnosis (Sasson et al., 2013). <nl><nl>ASD is as a highly heritable disorder with estimates as high as 90% (Losh et al., 2009). This genetic liability has been shown by family research to translate in unaffected relatives of ASD individuals as milder, subclinical expressions of the triad, identifiable as the BAP (Losh et al., 2009). Losh et al\u2019s (2009) assessed the BAP in the parents of ASD diagnosed individuals (n=83) using a battery of well-established tasks, measuring ASD symptoms across the triad. <nl>Losh et al (2009) found that of the ASD parents, 22 were identified as positive for social BAP characteristics and 34 identified as positive for rigidperfectionist BAP characteristics. Parents demonstrating social BAP performed significantly less accurately relative to controls on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and similar results were observed across all 6 social cognition measures. However, this was not seen as plainly for tasks assessing executive function and central coherence. This demonstrates the validity of the BAP in parents of ASD individuals and suggest its componential nature, supporting the fractionation of the triad of impairments. However, Losh et al\u2019s research did not control for other disorders such as schizophrenia, which has been proven to have phenotypic similarities to ASD, that also impair social cognition (Sasson et al., 2007). Research seeking to replicate this study should pre-screen for such disorders that could affect ability in tasks, to confirm finding specificity to ASD.<nl><nl><nl>Low to moderate inter-corelations between the triad domains of impairment in ASD individuals has been outlined by researchers as evidence in favour of the fractionation theory (Happ\u00e9 et al., 2006). Conversely, Murray et al (2014) suggests this may be a product of range restriction, underestimating the inter-corelation between traits in those diagnosed. It is argued that studies use of clinical samples represents only the extremes of ASD symptoms because of simultaneous selection in diagnosis, therefore attenuating trait variance and its corelation with other variables. Testing this Murray et al (2014) used a simulation study of 10,000,000 cases showing impairments in all 3 domains, to replicate diagnosis and compared this with real population data from 236 non ASD participants and 148 participants diagnosed with high functioning ASD or Asperger\u2019s. Results showed significantly low inter-corelations between triad domains in the simulation study compared to the population study corelation. It was argued that this demonstrates the attenuation of inter-correlations between traits when simultaneous selection occurs. Murray suggest that investigations of ASD symptom inter-corelations should use both clinical samples and non-diagnosed participants, if we are to assume the characteristic of ASD exist on a continuum within the general population. This conversely suggests that using the general population can serve to facilitate the argument that ASD is a coherent, non-fractionable disorder. With this being said, the use of a simulation to reflect the ASD diagnosis process lacks ecological validity and cannot fully capture the character of the selection process in diagnosis, meaning cautions should be taken when drawing conclusions. Furthermore, this study is not reflective of the broad spectrum of ASD as only high-functioning individuals were sampled meaning it cannot account for low-functioning individuals. <nl><nl><nl>To conclude the BAP has been influential in identifying the genetic basis of ASD with a wealth of family-based research supporting this claim (Losh et al., 2009; Constantino &amp; Todd, 2005). However, it remains the case that no single gene can account for all aspects of triad, implying that they may be instead be symptom specific (Happ\u00e9 et al., 2006). Research with the general population and those displaying the BAP can also be used in support of ASD being a coherent disorder as suggested by Murray et al (2014). Future research should aim to control for simultaneous, clarifying triad symptom correlations.", "positive": "<addr14_FN>,<nl><nl>I hope you are well!<nl><nl>I just submitted my assessments, however when i look at them on the submission receipts it comes up with a strange jargon font (see below).

{"anchor": "Creativity is a characteristic of experts in solving a problem, it is an unusual and insightful solution which is of real value which involves the integration of ideas. Creative solutions must be novel and acknowledged by society. The study of creativity consists of the 4 p\u2019s which focuses either on, creative people, creative processes, products of creativity and creative places (environment).<nl>According to the psychometric approach, participants are tested using mental tests for direct measurements. However, such tests often confound intelligence and creativity, because not all creative people are high in IQ. Supporting this theory, Guilford (1956) distinguished between convergent and divergent thinking. He proposed that convergent thinkers find one best solution to a problem whereas, divergent thinkers can lead to many solutions to the same problem. He concluded that, creativity is a form of divergent thinking, because it brings many unrelated ideas together, also known as insight. Therefore, creativity makes use of methods which test divergent thinking such as the \"unusual uses test\" by J.P. Guilford (1967). Although divergent creativity tests are time consuming, they provide accurate measures of creativity than convergence.<nl>Creative Insight can occur in three ways (Sternberg and Davidson, 1982). Firstly, selective encoding refers to most important information being extracted from what is available. Secondly, selective combination is known to be the best way of combining information is perceived. Lastly, selectively comparison, whereby the information for the current problem being solved is related by analogy to a similar problem in one\u2019s past, which often uses mental images (Shepard 1978). Utilising these steps, creativity can be made easier to obtain. <nl>The biographic and autographic approach for creativity is idiosyncratic and makes major use of peer judgments. Wallas (1926) identified 4 stages in the creative process which include; preparation which refers to problem solving, incubation which is yet controversial, inspiration and verification whereby the solution is checked.", "positive": "ww Ma\u2019sha\u2019Allah \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95<new>I look so scary wth<new>But time fliessss mannn<new>Miss youuuu\ud83e\udd7a\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f<new>Omgg noo wayyyy<new>Finally man we haven\u2019t met in like a yearrrr<new>Yesss just come next week? <day> the buses are running now aswell<new>Let me know as soon as u do!<new>Yess and <pers_FN_SN> aswell comeon<new>\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<new>What month do is she going<new>Omg really end of <month> ?<new>It better b before we come back\ud83d\ude02<new>Omg ur ganna come to hers aswell<new>So u need proper clothes n accessorise<new>Yesss omg can\u2019t wait<new>Yeah they\u2019re ganna b sik days<new>I\u2019m ganna b so bored when u go", "attacked": "ww Ma\u2019sha\u2019Allah \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95<new>I look so scary wth<new>But time fliessss mannn<new>Miss youuuu\ud83e\udd7a\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f<new>Omgg noo wayyyy<new>Finally man we haven\u2019t met in like a yearrrr<new>Yesss just come next week? <day> the buses are running now aswell<new>Let me love as soon as u do!<new>Yess and <pers_FN_SN> aswell comeon<new>\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<new>What month do is she sound<young>Omg really end of <month> ?<new>It better b before we come back\ud83d\ude02<new>Omg ur ganna come to hers aswell<new>So u need proper clothes n accessorise<new>Yesss omg can\u2019t wait<new>Yeah they\u2019re ganna b sik days<unexampled>I\u2019m ganna b so bored when u go", "attack_type": "synonym_replacement", "replacement_rate": 0.15, "stats": {"n_original_words": 86, "n_attacked_words": 86, "n_changed": 3, "change_rate": 0.0349}}

{"anchor": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs \u00a3157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a caf\u00e9. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a caf\u00e9 to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Caf\u00e9 Kluuvikatu 3, caf\u00e9 which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too. Furthermore, i found a live music bar for my CEO to visit, called Storyville, Helsinki. this offers food, alongside live music band, piano room and dance floor which seems very entertaining.", "positive": "r <addr11_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I hope you\u2019re well.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>For my assignment which is about <assignment_title>, I have created a small a questionnaire to see how people who have little, no or full interest in <sport> are able to spot <event> occurring and why they think it is more common in <continent_adj> Countries than in <country>.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>The participants I have chosen are my friends.

{"anchor": "Background Information<nl><nl>Kenya Airways celebrated 43 years of operations in January 2020. However, according to passengers who have recently flown with Kenya Airways, the airline is performing poorly and not meeting customer expectations. Standards have decreased and the quality of the overall experience has worsened. Based on the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, this is evident. There have been many occurrences of lost luggage, poor customer service within the airport and on the aircraft, and insufficient in-flight entertainment. This report will address these complaints using the quantitative and qualitative data collected and analysed to make comparisons with and provide sufficient recommendations for improvement.<nl>Quantitative Research<nl><nl><nl>Secondary data, \"data previously collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand.\" (Malhotra, Nunan and Birks, 2017) was gathered for a 5-year period (2016 - 2020 inclusive). The data was then logged into an Excel spreadsheet, where the customer name, gender, travel month and year, cabin type i.e. economy, route i.e. international, origin and destination were provided along with the overall rating of the experience and individual rating of each characteristic. The sampling technique used was stratified sampling: \"\u2026a two-step process to partition the population into strata. Elements are selected from each stratum randomly.\" (Malhotra, Birks and Willis, 2013). Customers\u2019 reviews were picked based on the year but at random. This technique was also chosen due to its increased precision and the need to include important information i.e. all eight individual ratings completed. Customers who had not completed all eight reviews were ignored during the selection procedure as all eight reviews had to be completed to enable graphs to be drawn and comparisons and conclusions to be made. <nl><nl>The question that rises from the data collected is: \"does gender influence the ratings of airline services?\" The two sample groups are male and female. A grouping variable t-test was carried out to work out the significance (appendix 2b). Since we have two groups, we want to compare the mean of \u2018Array 1\u2019 represented by males and \u2018Array 2\u2019 represented by females. As it is not known which gender scored a higher average rating, a two-tailed test using equal variances (2) needs to be carried out. Our results show a significance of 0.56 (to 2 d.p.), which indicates that it is not statistically significant. The significance value is more than 0.05 (p&gt;0.05) and the t-value is less than 1.96 (t&lt;1.96) which proves the results are not significant. Therefore, there is no difference in one gender rating services higher than the other, and there is no expectation that the differences will be replicated in other samples. <nl><nl>To support this further, the airline characteristics ratings were split by gender, where the number of males were 50 and the number of females were 28. A table of the average individual ratings and standard deviation were recorded (appendix 2a) and a graph to represent the averages was drawn as shown on the next page.<nl><figure><nl>From the graph, it is evident that females gave lower ratings compared to males (except for \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019, where males rated it an average of 3.10 and females rated it 3.18). The biggest difference in ratings was for \u2018legroom\u2019 with a difference of 0.33. The standard deviation for males and females is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and there is a normal distribution. Therefore, it supports our hypothesis test of there not being a significant difference. An overall average airline rating was calculated and plotted in a graph as shown below. <nl><figure><nl>The graph shows that the most poorly rated characteristic was the \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 with a rating of 3.06. With all individual ratings being around 3, the overall rating can be assumed as an average of 3. We can compare these results with the overview of the official rating of the airline displayed on the TripAdvisor website (appendix 1b). The link for the website page is indicated by appendix 1c. The results are similar to the TripAdvisor ratings meaning the data collected is representative of the population. The standard deviation was also calculated for comparison and recorded in a table along with the averages (appendix 1a). From the table, it is evident that the standard deviation is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and that there is a normal distribution.<nl><nl>To understand whether each characteristic has improved from 2016-2020, a table of averages was created (appendix 3). The table shows the total average for each year declining, where the best year was 2016 (average of 3.77) and the worst year was 2020 (average of 2.91) \u2013 the graph indicates this. A line graph was drawn to represent this information (below).<nl><nl><figure><nl>The biggest decline was from 2019 to 2020, with a difference of 0.44. However, there was an improvement in the customer service from 2018-2019 with a rise of 0.57. In the year 2017, \u2018cleanliness\u2019 had the highest average (3.92) compared to the rest of the years. Again, this proves that quality of services has been declining. Therefore, the overall quality of characteristics has worsened.<nl>Qualitative Research<nl><nl>To further support the quantitative analysis, secondary qualitative research was carried out. This was done by randomly selecting 25 customer reviews from the years 2016-2020 (5 for each year). All 25 reviews were analysed, and a coding frame (appendix 4a) was written up to categorise the factors further. For example, check-in and boarding was broken down into flights, luggage, and other. This was to understand in detail what the reviews highlighted.<nl><nl>Appendix 4b indicates an example of an analysed positive review that includes characteristics such as value for money, check-in and boarding, seat comfort, food and beverage, and in-flight entertainment. For example, the customer (travel year 2020) commented on the \u2018seats being very comfortable\u2019. The average rating for seat comfort in 2020 was 3.10. Although there was a very minor decrease (0.05) from 2019, it can be assumed the seat comfort is steady and quality is not changing drastically. <nl><nl>However, throughout the 5-year period, customer service was the most frequently complained about (airline staff and cabin crew) with a total of 12 negative complaints each. Airline staff includes staff who are not directly involved in the airport or aircraft, but are still part of Kenya Airways staff i.e. headquarters, call centres etc. The majority of complaints relating to airline staff were about staff being unfriendly, impolite, and incompetent. Some reviews mentioned that staff need to be trained as there was no sense of empathy. On the other hand, there was 1 positive review which mentioned the service being on a \u2018high level\u2019. Cabin crew also had 12 negative reviews, mostly about the staff not caring about errors made as well as not apologising. On the other hand, there were 9 positive reviews, making the total -3. This tells us that although there are positive customer service reviews, there are more negative ones meaning that customer service is worsening over the years. This can be also be proved by the graph shown by appendix 3 where the customer service rating fell from 2016 (4.00) to 2020 (2.90). This indicates greater confidence in customer service declining as there are frequent reviews to support this.<nl><nl>Appendix 4c shows a negative review written by a customer in 2016. The review mentions customer service (airport staff and cabin crew) and food and beverage (qualityportion). Again, customer service was poor due to staff not caring or apologising. Furthermore, the airline had run out of vegetarian meals and no drinks were offered either. The coding frame shows the total for \u2018qualityportion\u2019 as -3, indicating that the airline is performing poorly in this service. Appendix 1a highlights that \u2018food and beverage\u2019 is the second lowest characteristic rated by customers with an average of 3.25. This supports the coding frame.<nl>On the other hand, there are three characteristics where the airline is performing well \u2013 legroom, seat comfort, and food and beverage \u2013 taste. The total scores based on the coding frame are 2, 3, and 2 respectively. Legroom had 2 positive reviews, both commenting on spaciousness, seat comfort had 4 positive reviews, and food and beverage \u2013 taste, had 4 positive reviews commenting on good and fresh taste. However, there were also negative reviews for seat comfort, where seats were not as comfortable and the taste of food not being great. Overall, Kenya Airways are doing well in these areas of service. Appendix 1a shows this for \u2018legroom\u2019 as it has the second highest average rating of 3.60, which supports the qualitative research and indicates greater confidence since reviews are consistent hence representative.<nl><nl>Whilst appendix 4b has a positive review based on flying business class, other customers travelling in business class had negative experiences, based on poor customer service, rude staff and lost luggage. Therefore, this demonstrates inconsistency of the airline as customers are receiving different treatment even when demographics are the same. Rather, customers in business class are having the same issues as those travelling in economy, which raises the question as to whether Kenya Airways view all customers as equivalent despite paying extra for better service. Moreover, staff are lacking in training which leads to poor service regardless of whichever cabin customers are flying in.<nl>Recommendations<nl><nl>Kenya Airways are performing at an average level (3.0) in comparison to competitors such as Qatar Airways (4.0) (Qatar Airways Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020) and Emirates (4.0) (Emirates Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020). While Kenya Airways are scoring close to an average rating of 4.0 in characteristics such as \u2018cleanliness\u2019 (3.71) and \u2018legroom\u2019 (3.60), they are scoring low in characteristics such as \u2018in-flight entertainment\u2019 (3.06) and \u2018food and beverage\u2019 (3.25) while receiving frequent complaints about services such as \u2018check-in and boarding\u2019 and \u2018customer service\u2019. Therefore, in order to excel, regain customer confidence and outperform competitors, many improvements need to be made throughout the airline. <nl><nl>Firstly, improvements need to be made in customer service, mainly the airport staff and cabin crew. According to reviews on TripAdvisor, the cabin crew have a lack of care and are impolite towards passengers. As suggested by customers and to avoid future negative interactions with passengers, training needs to take place frequently e.g. every 4-6 months to ensure staff members are able to handle situations with care, show understanding and remain polite. Once training is complete, staff should be tested by answering scenario questions. Those who score less than 70% should undergo further training. The process can be repeated until they score 70% or over. Customers who feel comfortable and at ease are more likely to have a positive flight experience, resulting in greater positive reviews and higher ratings. Moreover, airport staff are being criticised of showing attitude and being unhelpful. Again, training needs to take place to avoid future negative experiences. A similar assessment as the cabin crew can be carried out with questions aimed more specifically for airport staff.<nl><nl>Secondly, the in-flight entertainment needs to be improved. Passengers have complained about the equipment being broken and the movie list not being up to date. This can be quite frustrating especially when flying for long hours as there is no sufficient entertainment available to use. The first course of action should be for the movie listing to be updated (as mentioned in one review) on all aeroplanes and provide a wider array of entertainment as Emirates do (appendix 5). This will keep passengers entertained for the length of the flight. To avoid faulty equipment, all equipment should be checked before passengers aboard the plane.<nl><nl>Finally, the portion and overall quality of food needs to be improved. There have been a number of complains written by customers who mention the portion size of food is little and sometimes drinks are not offered either. This can be seen as unacceptable, especially for those flying in businessfirst class as complimentary drinks are mandatory and passengers are paying extra (value for money). Portions need to increase as a result, by up to 25% to satisfy expectations and drinks need to be offered with every meal, as well as in between.", "positive": "\ufffd<new>Yeah that\u2019s fine \ud83d\ude02<new>What are the toppings<new>Is it toppings?

{"anchor": "Introduction<nl>Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. <nl>Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. <nl>Evaluation of market segment<nl>With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this \u2018Under 22\u2019 bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 \u2013 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher\u2019s fairs should focus on the \u2018Under 22\u2019 package as this is most relevant to first year students.<nl><nl><nl>Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city.<nl>This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success.<nl>Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel.<nl><nl>Positioning<nl>As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost.<nl>To identify Car Club\u2019s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. <nl>Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers\u2019 initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people.<nl><figure><nl>If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of \u00a33.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around \u00a32.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It\u2019s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. <nl>Sixt and Avis start at \u00a351 (Sixt 2020) and \u00a360 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of \u00a336day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs.<nl>The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club\u2019s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility.<nl>In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success.<nl><figure><nl>Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team!<nl>The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club\u2019s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category.<nl><nl>Car Club\u2019s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so.<nl>From Car Club\u2019s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham.<nl><figure><nl>Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives.<nl><nl>Campaign Objectives<nl>1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population)<nl>As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham\u2019s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher\u2019s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club\u2019s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention.<nl><nl>2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher\u2019s fairs within the city<nl>Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users\u2019 involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. <nl><nl>Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools<nl>The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming.<nl>Push strategy \u2013 Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student\u2019s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise\u2019s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors.<nl><nl>Pull strategy \u2013 This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers\u2019 minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness.<nl>As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers\u2019 positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion.<nl><nl>Marketing tools plan<nl>Personal selling<nl>Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication \u2026 in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy \u2026 a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers\u2019 presence on campus at  fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club\u2019s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. <nl><nl>Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use.<nl>Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise\u2019s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. <nl>Testing<nl>Personal sellers\u2019 ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher\u2019s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the  venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data.<nl>Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments.<nl><nl>Advertising<nl>Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication \u2026 designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS\u2019 lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that  \"77%\u00a0of students are using Instagram, and\u00a075%\u00a0are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club\u2019s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students\u2019 social-media usage whilst remaining affordable.<nl>Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness.<nl><nl>Integration of marketing communications <nl>Enterprise\u2019s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits \u2018Generation-Z\u2019 as they are socially active \u2018communaholics\u2019, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide.<nl>Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company\u2019s market position and standing by Enterprise\u2019s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service.<nl>The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online.<nl><nl>Implementation plan<nl>Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April \u2013 Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops.<nl>Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn\u2019t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "positive": "r <addr23_FN>,<nl><nl>There was some confusion within our group about submitting coursework and how to do so meaning that our second submission (done by myself) was an hour or two past the deadline.

In addition, I am more than happy to sign any waivers or disclaimers affect insurance, which I will arrange myself. <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I will be able to self-isolate prior to go and will take private transfers at either end of the flight.

{"anchor": "Abstract: <nl>This report goes into detail about a study which investigated the type of personality that an individual has whether that is openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (OCEAN) and how it affects the health of an individual from bad eating habits to lifelong illness. The predictions overall were all as expected, that certain personality types have different eating habits. The major findings of the results were the participants overall do not have unhealthy eating behaviours and habits. It could be said that the predictor values have a weak correlational relationship with the FFQ scores, in addition to this the result also show that the personality factors have negative correlations with the FFQ score apart from neuroticism. <nl>Introduction: <nl>Personality as said by Allport in 1961 is a dynamic organisation in an individual of psychophysical systems that create the characteristics, behaviour, thoughts and feelings of a person (Carducci, 2009). Many researchers have looked into the relationship between health and personality and have found that there could be a correlation between them therefore it is important to study more about the topic. Furthermore, by finding out about the correlation between an individual\u2019s personality and eating behaviour it could aid the public health sector. If psychologist are able to develop theories based on the personality types of an individual linked to their eating habits which may be causing them health complications, then individuals may be able to better their health and reduce their issues from the advice they get due to research from psychologist. The widely accepted structure of personality is the \u2018Big 5\u2019 which is the five-factor model test. This is a self-report test that measures the big five personality traits, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN) where individuals have to see how they score by rating each statement regarding how well it describes themselves. After completing this test, the individual can see how their personality traits are and how it may affect their day to day life (Raad &amp; Perugini , 2002).<nl>Predictions:<nl>Based on previous research done by Lunn et al in 2014 it would be correct to predict that individuals with more increased openness will have a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet would be present.  Furthermore, participants with a high conscientiousness  reflect self- discipline and determination, therefore, are also likely to have a general healthy diet therefore it would be right to say that a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet could be predicted. In addition to this, Wicki in 2010 found that stimulation seeking could explain the association between extraversion with alcohol consumption this means they could be prone to bad eating habits. Therefore, extraversion could be positively correlated with an unhealthy diet. Similar to this studies have shown that an individual with more neuroticism could be reliant on bad eating habits and prone to bad health and this is due to their general tension and negative emotions, so they use it to cope. Therefore, it could be predicted that individuals with high neuroticism will have a positive correlation with an unhealthy diet. Lastly, agreeableness needs further investigations, but the prediction could be that they could have a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet, because they are mostly positive and have a positive mindset and therefore this could also lead to a healthier life and healthier mind(Johansen, 2018).<nl><nl>Method<nl>Design:<nl>For this study the independent variable was the personality traits that the participants were being tested on called OCEAN- openness, conscientious, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. A within subjects\u2019 design was used as the participants are answering all of the independent variables on the questionnaire. The dependant variable in this study was the FFQ scores that the participants scored on the test, in this case it would be the unhealthy eating  score. <nl>Participants:<nl>Within this study 195 participants were used from the general population and were aged between 15 and 73 years old (n=195). The participants consisted of both females and males. <nl>Materials:<nl>All participants were given a questionnaire sheet to complete along with a pen. The items used in the FFQ and BFI, the BFI scoring technique can be found in the Hartmann and Johns paper.<nl>Procedure:<nl>For this study firstly informed consent was taken and the participants were aware that they had the right to withdraw at any time during the study. All participants were given the questionnaire to complete within an hour and were told to put a number next to all the statements in the questionnaire. They were asked to answer as honestly as they could and following this all of the questionnaires had their results taken in and were analysed.<nl>Results: <nl><table><nl>From the table you are able to see that the figures for the standardized B are low digits. The correlation is not significant. <nl><table><nl>Discussion:<nl>From the table above you are able to see  correlation did not show a significant association between the personality and health. It could be said that the predictor values have a weak correlational relationship with the FFQ scores, in addition to this the result also show that the personality factors have negative correlations with the FFQ score apart from neuroticism. In addition to this, the descriptive statistics show that the minimum score of the FFQ was 1.50 and the maximum score for the FFQ score was 111.50, which is a large range. Lastly this caused the mean to equal 21.7 and therefore that concludes that the participants overall do not have unhealthy eating behaviours and habits.<nl>These results are what the predictions stated earlier on in the report, e.g. it was predicted that the participants with a high neuroticism FFQ score will have a positive correlation with bad and unhealthy eating habits and this could be due to the fact that they are prone to bad eating habits as a way of coping with their stress. Individuals with the conscientiousness score showed that it was a predictor.<nl>In addition to this, there are logical explanations as to why the study proved the predictions. Firstly, it could be because normally self- report methods are bias on behalf of the participants as they may want to seem and come across better than they actually are, which is known as social desirability bias. In this case, it would have been expected that the participants were giving more desirable answers, and this led to \"healthier\" individuals. This also proves that previous research is accurate. Due to these results it is evident that the correlational study is reliable and holds high validity.", "positive": "<nl>I thought I should tell u that I might be 510 Mins late to the 2pm study, sorry in advanced.<nl><part_FN_SN> <student_number><new>Hi, <nl>I have a study with you at 12:10 I might be 510 minutes, sorry in advance.<new>Hi, <nl>I had a questionnaire today at 9am, but I didn't get sent any link to actually complete it, I'm unsure of what to do. <nl><nl><part_FN> (<student_number>) <new>Hi, <nl>I have a study at 3pm, <day>, however I have an overlap with another study, I\u2019m not sure whether I have to cancel this study now or if I could do it at another time? <nl>I\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience.<nl><part_FN_SN> (<student_number>) <new>Dear <addr13_FN>, <nl><nl>Thank you for the opportunity anyways. <nl><nl>Kind regards, <nl><part_FN>  <new>Dear <organisation> recruitment team, <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I recently completed my strengths assessment online for a placement <YYYY><YYYY>, however I received an email today reminding me to take the assessment, so I am a little confused by this.

I hope you\u2019re doing well and staying safe!<nl><nl>Today I received a grade for one of my modules, and i\u2019ve never felt the need to contest a grade but sadly with this module I do. I pride myself in not getting below a first in all coursework\u2019s, because I generally do better in them than exams... and had set myself the target of graduating with a first this year. The grade I received back today was 50% (2:2) which was disheartening as I tried so hard on this essay, and really enjoyed doing it. It\u2019s also a module that has really interested employers when mentioned, so to have such a low grade worries me. I had to cancel an interview today due to my upset and worry about the impact of this module.<nl><nl>The feedback received criticised two things- not talking about myself (where I come from) which we were told to actively avoid so to not be identifiable. Also not exploring my interviewee\u2019s experiences and engaging with theoretical facets instead. However, when looking at the assignment brief, I had discussed everything they wanted, pulling in both theory and information from my interview... and also adding additional sections to provide more information about my interviewee\u2019s culture and behaviour.<nl><nl>I wish to get a remark on this essay, because I genuinely feel like I\u2019ve provided everything the brief asked for- and more, and I received a 1st in second year for a module very similar to this one.<nl><nl>Could you advise me on how I can get this remarked as I\u2019ve never gone through this process before... I don\u2019t know whether I need to contact the module leader- and I\u2019m quite anxious to do so as I don\u2019t wish to come across as rude. I also don\u2019t wish for there to be conflict (I switched modules this term due to an assessment being debate based and I wanted to avoid that!), but due to the unfamiliarity of this process I do not know how to respectfully approach this issue? I was just extremely disheartened by getting a 50 in a subject I enjoyed so much, and especially in my final year where I\u2019m working so hard to get a first, and my other grades reflect this too.<nl><nl>Thank you for any help you can give, and sorry for the long email!<nl><nl><part_FN_SN>", "positive": "t\u2019s good with me, only just woke up\ud83d\ude02<new>You working??<new>Yeah okay\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I might be having lunch then though\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d<new>I still haven\u2019t eaten\u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f I might just leave you to work on your own if that\u2019s okay, just don\u2019t want to be with you for an hour and then keep having to leave \u2639\ufe0f<new>I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a<new>So majestic!!!

{"anchor": "Thank you for visiting. <nl><nl>Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee\u2019s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. <nl><nl>You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work.<nl><nl>Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant\u2019s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is \u00a352,000, any award exceeding \u00a325,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder\u2019s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee\u2019s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks\u2019 notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks\u2019 notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks\u2019 worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal\u2019s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use \u2018other substantial reason,\u2019 ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be \u2018misconduct,\u2019 regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder\u2019s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>\u2022 No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>\u2022 Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>\u2022 Narinder\u2019s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>\u2022 The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder\u2019s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>\u2022 Same as Option 1. <nl>\u2022 WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder\u2019s behaviour. <nl>\u2022 WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>\u2022 Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>\u2022 Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 You will be free from Narinder\u2019s treatment. <nl>\u2022 You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>\u2022 You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>\u2022 You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>\u2022 Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>\u2022 You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>\u2022 You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>\u2022 Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>\u2022 Same as Option 4.<nl>\u2022 There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks\u2019 worth salary (\u00a310,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately \u00a34,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (\u00a31,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your \u2018Christmas [bonus]\u2019 regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual \u2018right[s] to receive.\u2019 <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days\u2019 leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days\u2019 worth salary (\u00a33,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals \u00a319,263.96. This includes notice salary (\u00a310,000), Pension (\u00a34,000), untaken leave (\u00a33,703.96) and Christmas bonus (\u00a31,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals \u00a317,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals \u00a311,763.96 or \u00a310,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal\u2019s maximum award of \u00a325,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. <nl><nl>Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. <nl>Basic Award <nl>Tribunal will award you \u00a36,300 based on your weekly gross salary (\u00a3525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. <nl><nl>Compensatory Award<nl>The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (\u00a378,000), as it is below \u00a386,444 cap. This may be lower (\u00a325,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job.<nl><nl>If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (\u00a384,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. <nl><nl>Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this.  The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. <nl><nl>Additional information<nl>Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract.<nl><nl>Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. <nl><nl>I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely, <nl>", "positive": "r <addr7_NN>,<nl><nl>I hope you\u2019re well. <nl><nl>I\u2019m in a sticky situation regarding the submission of my <module> Summative. <nl><nl>I have written confirmation from one of my <module> module tutors (<pers_FN>) that this assignment does not require a bibliography.

{"anchor": "Faces are vital in conveying emotions and allowing humans to nonverbally interact with each other (Little et al., 2011). It also allows us to distinguish other social drivers such as power, attractiveness, and personality traits, just from a glimpse (Zebrowitz, 2017). Regarding emotion, there has been an ongoing debate to see to what extent facial displays of emotion are universal. With more research coming into the light, arguments have been swayed to not support the idea of universality.<nl><nl>To \u2018correctly\u2019 recognise emotion from a facial display can be considered subjective, as one person will not perceive emotion in the same manner as another. Yet some studies have shown the \u2018happy\u2019 facial display to be the most correctly recognized facial display out of the proposed seven (Mishra et al., 2018; West et al., 2012). Difficulties come into play when there are a variety of smiles from a \u2018happy\u2019 face that can be distinguished (Frank, 2002). This comes to question on the universality of emotions in faces. <nl>This leads on to explain the theoretical models that have been proposed to refute the universality theory of emotions in facial displays. The behavioural ecology view of facial displays (BECV) is one theory from an array of theoretical models which takes the stance against the universality thesis (Crivelli &amp; Fridlund, 2018). It claims that the emotions we express through our faces are a \u2018social tool\u2019, meaning that we use our face to nonverbally interact and elicit reactions from humans. The theory had also recognised that facial displays of emotion will vary across different environments, this notion was supported by Crivelli\u2019s own study in the Trobriand Island, where he had found low levels of correct recognition on all five of the facial displays by the Trobrianders (Crivelli et al., 2017).<nl><nl>Further research that supports the BECV has often looked at how facial recognition of emotion differs between culture; the significance of Ekman\u2019s work in cross-cultural studies tends to be cited around this topic. However, with more research around emotion becoming apparent, new studies tend to have a different perspective on Ekman\u2019s study. For instance, in one of his studies, he had reported that the Fore Tribe tended to select the 'surprised' photograph 67% of the time when a story about \u2018someone feeling fearful\u2019 was told (Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1971). Dailey et al (2010) had found the same result in his study but brought a different angle to the table. He had used Japanese and American participants rather than a small-scale indigenous society; the Japanese participants tended to sway more towards the surprised face when it was a fear face being presented on the screen.<nl><nl>Dailey et al\u2019s (2010) main conclusion on this result was it initially came down to cultural differences, as the Japanese and the Fore tribe have different social contexts compared to the westerners. But specifically, he went to mention in his discussion that Japanese people tend to not fear strangers as much as Americans do (Matsumoto, 1988). In this case, Japanese people would not view the fear facial expression as occasionally in their daily life as Americans, this would therefore explain why they did not correctly identify a \u2018fear\u2019 facial display in the tasks when it was presented. Hence, it can be argued that social contexts will affect one\u2019s perceptions of recognising facial displays of emotions.<nl><nl>Nevertheless, studies like the ones mentioned above tend to use facial displays that exaggerate the emotion however, in real life emotions tend to not be expressed in such a \u2018cartoon-like\u2019 way, instead, they are more subtle and sometimes even morphed with other emotions. With this being said evidence still shows that there are cultural differences in identifying subtle facial expressions. In a recent study by Zhang et al (2014), they had found that Americans were better at judging subtle negative emotions (angry and sad) than Chinese participants. It is said that this occurs because it is common for Chinese people to express their negative emotions more outwardly, as subtle negative facial expressions might hinder their interpersonal harmony in their society (Matsumoto 1989; Matsumoto and Ekman 1989; Matsumoto et al., 2008). So, subtle negative emotions such as \u2018anger\u2019 and \u2018sad\u2019 would not be recognised in facial expressions. In essence, this still supports the fact that there are cultural differences regardless of facial expressions being presented in a more subtle or overemphasised manner.  <nl><nl>The studies above clearly emphasize the fact that facial recognition of emotions cannot be universal, as there are significant differences when both cultures were identifying emotions from faces; this comes down to differences in cultural context as they vary in \"social ideologies and practices of the cultural groups\" (Jack et al., 2012). This comes in line to support the BECV theory, as both studies highlight that context is important and impacts a person in identifying emotions from facial expressions.<nl><nl>The cross-cultural studies mentioned above might have some limitations, for example, they tend to only follow an etic approach as researchers will usually be outside of the culture they are studying, which might mean valuable detail in communication could be lost in translation sometimes (Buil et al., 2012). Accordingly, converging neurological studies helps in the understanding of how the brain affects behaviour regardless of social context; so, research in this area would not be impacted by an etic or emic approach, which would help in further understanding why facial recognition of emotion is not universal. <nl><nl>In opposition to the BECV theory, Ekman had proposed an outdated \u2018Basic emotions theory\u2019 (BET) which followed a more Darwinian approach. It emphasised that facial expressions of emotion are a biological process and is hardwired, with seven basic emotions that humans can express and identify from (Ekman and Friesen, 1969); therefore, it can show a universal pattern in recognising facial displays of emotion regardless of social context. <nl><nl>The field of neuropsychology has challenged the BET by stating that facial recognition of emotion is not as hardwired and biological as it seems. In regard to the Haxby et model (2000), it has stated that facial perception occurs in the core system (superior temporal sulcus) and then further expands into the extended system in where the amygdala will be able to process emotion from faces. This model is supported by Foley et al\u2019s study (2012) as it found an increase in activity levels of the bilateral STS and the amygdala when perceiving emotions from facial expressions. <nl><nl>The universality thesis comes to be challenged when impairments in the amygdala occur; when the amygdala is impaired there are significant differences that are seen in the processing of negative emotions (Whalen et al., 2013). This will be further examined by looking into individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as they display an atypical amygdala (Kliemann et al., 2012). A study that had shown this had used Ekman and Friesen\u2019s (1976) series of facial displays in an upright and inverted manner, to witness if ASD individuals identified emotions differently (Wallace et al., 2008). They had found that people with ASD were significantly worse at identifying facial displays in both upright and inverted conditions, they had even tended to misidentify 'fear' for 'anger'. This was similarly seen in Ashwin et al\u2019s (2006) study where ASD individuals were more impaired on emotions such as \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018anger\u2019 and \u2018disgust\u2019. This shows that impairment in the amygdala does affect how ASD individuals perceive emotion in faces. <nl><nl>Black et al (2017) had argued that behaviour studies are not able to localise where the difficulty lies in the brain of ASD individuals, so we cannot assume correlation will imply causation. Instead, neuroimaging studies will provide us with the neural specificity to locate what parts of the brain that actually cause this disruption. Hence, a review had examined a variety of neurological studies and had found an association between the amygdala in ASD people and facial emotion recognition (Harms et al., 2010). A supporting study had used a functional magnetic resonance imaging and found that ASD adults had a greater right amygdala activation when viewing facial displays, than neurotypical adults (Monk et al., 2010). <nl><nl>In addition, this evidence can expand to further diagnosis\u2019 such as people with encephalitis, who also have severe amygdala damage; they tend to show the same recognition as ASD individuals with identifying fear and disgust (Sprengelmeyer, 1998). This has been further highlighted in Broks et al (1998) study, where the individuals had difficulties identifying fear in a facial emotion recognition task. This conveys that regardless of what diagnosis or condition a person is suffering from, the damage to the amygdala will impact one\u2019s perception of emotion in faces.<nl><nl>The evidence that is provided above clearly goes against the BET, as ASD and encephalitis individuals were not able to correctly identify negative faces (Broks et al.,1998; Ashwin et al., 2006), meaning that it is not a biological process as Ekman had stated. But despite this, it can still be argued that if ASD individuals did have an intact amygdala, they would correctly identify emotion from faces. However, if this were the case a neurotypical individual would correctly identify all emotions in a facial emotion recognition task, but Wallace et al (2008) had found that the neurotypical individuals still managed to incorrectly recognise anger as disgust 10% of the time. This further complicates the BET, as it shows to not be as hardwired as it mentions. <nl><nl>To conclude the two opposing theories of facial recognition of emotion have two different fields of research. A large body of evidence in cultural differences has come to show that the BECV theory has been an appropriate theoretical model to explain why facial recognition is not universal, additionally, evidence in the field of neuropsychology challenges the BET  model. The converging evidence in these two fields has still come to show that the universality thesis can be refuted.", "positive": "no sorry, I have been looking at an older version of my research protocol !
